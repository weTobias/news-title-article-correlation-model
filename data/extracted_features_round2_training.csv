Noam Chomsky , towering figure linguistics cognitive science , long maintained language sensorimotor systems distinct entities — modules need work gestural communication , means conveying interpreting symbolic thought . researchers fully understand language organized brain neural circuits derive meaning gesture , question unsettled . scientists , like Anthony Dick , associate professor Florida International University , theorize functions rely brain structures . functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scans brain activity , Dick colleagues demonstrated interpretation “ co - speech ” gestures consistently recruits language processing centers . specific areas involved degree activation vary age , suggests young brain honing gesture - speech integration skills refining connections regions . Dick words , “ Gesture essentially spire broader language system , ” integrates semantic processing regions sensorimotor areas . extent perception language sensorimotor experience , way learning world depends sensory impressions movements ? Manuela Macedonia recently finished master degree linguistics noticed recurring pattern students teaching Italian Johannes Kepler University Linz ( JKU ): matter times repeated words , stammer coherent sentence . Printing phrases ad nauseam help , . “ good listeners , ” said , “ able speak . ” teaching book : students listen , write , practice repeat , Chomsky advocate , . missing . Today , senior scientist Institute Information Engineering JKU researcher Max Planck Institute Human Cognitive Brain Sciences Leipzig , Macedonia getting closer hypothesis sounds lot like Dick : language modular . children learning language , Macedonia argues , absorb information entire bodies . word like “ onion , ” example , tightly linked senses : Onions bulbous shape , papery skin rustles , bitter tang tear - inducing odor sliced . abstract concepts like “ delight ” multisensory components , smiles , laughter jumping joy .   extent , cognition “ embodied”—the brain activity modified body actions experiences , vice versa . wonder , , foreign words stick students listening , writing , practicing repeating , verbal experiences stripped sensory associations . Macedonia found learners reinforce new words performing semantically related gestures engage motor regions improve recall . simply repeat word “ bridge ” : arch hands recite . Pick suitcase , strum guitar ! wires brain retention , words labels clusters experiences acquired lifetime . Multisensory learning allows words like “ onion ” live place brain — distributed entire networks . node decays neglect , active node restore connected . “ node knows nodes know , ” Macedonia said . power gestures enrich speech represent way gesture integrated sensory experiences . growing body work suggests , language gesture intimately entwined , motor production perception . Specifically , neural systems underlying gesture observation understanding influenced past experiences generating movements , according Elizabeth Wakefield . Wakefield , Goldin - Meadow protégé , directs lab assistant professor Loyola University Chicago , studies way everyday actions aid learning influence cognition . examine questions depth , needed understand gesture processing develops . graduate student working neuroscientist Karin James Indiana University 2013 , performed fMRI study examine gesture perception children adults . participants watched videos actress gestured spoke , visual language processing regions areas firing . Brain areas associated motor experiences active , participants lay scanner . Adults showed activity regions children , , Wakefield thinks adults experience making similar motions ( children tend gesture talk ) . “ , knowledge , people looking gesture processing development , ” Wakefield said . “ small body literature gesture processed developmentally important implications think gesture shaping learning . ” Wakefield study evidence gesture perception purposeful action stand neural foundation . Countless experiments demonstrated similar motor “ mirroring ” phenomenon actions associated ballet , basketball , playing guitar , tying knots reading music . case , skilled individuals observed craft performed , sensorimotor areas active corresponding areas participants expertise . ( Paradoxically , experiments observed exactly opposite effect : Experts ’ brains reacted non - experts watched skills . researchers theorized cases , experience brains efficient processing motions . ) Lorna Quandt , assistant professor Gallaudet University studies phenomena deaf hard hearing , takes fine - grained approach . breaks gestures sensorimotor components , electroencephalography ( EEG ) memories making certain actions change predict perceive ’ gestures . study , colleagues recorded EEG patterns adult participants handled objects varying colors weights , watched man video interact items . man simply mimed actions objects pointed making contact , participants ’ brains reacted manipulating articles . , neural activity reflected experience : EEG patterns showed recollections objects heavy light predictably influenced perception man . “ performing gesture , processing seeing ; processing think going , ” Quandt said . “ powerful lens view action perception . ” brain anticipates sensorimotor experiences , milliseconds . Exactly motor experience required ? According Quandt experiments , straightforward task expert color - weight associations , tactile trial , reading written information . According Dick , notion brain motor areas active humans immobile observing ’ movements ( phenomenon known “ observation - execution matching ” ) generally - established . remains controversial degree regions extract meaning ’ actions . contentious mechanism serve basis heightened understanding sensorimotor activation . coordinated activity multiple brain regions , boil activity individual cells ? century ago , psychologist Walter Pillsbury wrote : “ mind explained terms movement . ” concept modern incarnation mirror neuron theory , posits ability glean meaning gesture speech explained activation single cells key brain regions . increasingly clear , , available evidence role mirror neurons everyday behaviors oversold overinterpreted . mirror neuron theory got start 1990s , group researchers studying monkeys found specific neurons inferior premotor cortex responded animals certain goal - directed movements like grasping . scientists surprised note cells fired monkeys passively observed experimenter making similar motions . like clear case observation - execution matching single - cell level . researchers came possible explanations : “ mirror neurons ” simply communicating information action help monkey select appropriate motor response . instance , thrust hand initiate handshake , natural reaction probably mirror . Alternatively , single cells form basis “ action understanding , ” way interpret meaning movements . possibility allow monkeys match actions observed relatively little mental computation . idea ultimately usurped beautifully simple way explain intuit meaning ’ movements . years passed , evidence poured similar mechanism humans , mirror neurons implicated long list phenomena , including empathy , imitation , altruism autism spectrum disorder , . reports mirroring activity related brain regions gesture observation speech perception , mirror neurons associated language gesture , . Gregory Hickok , professor cognitive language sciences University California , Irvine , staunch mirror neuron critic , maintains , decades ago , founders mirror neuron theory threw weight wrong explanation . view , mirror neurons deserve thoroughly investigated , pinpoint focus roles speech action understanding hindered research progress . Observation - execution matching likely involved motor planning understanding , argues . continue champion theory action understanding begun pump brakes , according Valeria Gazzola , leads Social Brain Laboratory Netherlands Institute Neuroscience associate professor University Amsterdam . advocate mirror neuron theory , Gazzola acknowledged consensus actually means “ understand ” action . “ variability misunderstanding , ” said . mirror neurons serve important component cognition , “ explain story , probably true . ” Initially , evidence mirroring humans derived studies probed activity millions neurons simultaneously , techniques fMRI , EEG , magnetoencephalography transcranial magnetic stimulation . Researchers begun experiment techniques like fMRI adaptation , use analyze subpopulations cells specific cortical regions . rarely opportunity direct measurements individual cells human brain , provide direct proof mirror neuron activity . “ doubt mirror neurons exist , ” Hickok said , “ brain imaging brain activation studies correlational . tell causation . ” , people speak motor disabilities like severe forms cerebral palsy cases perceive speech gestures . need fully functioning motor systems ( mirror neurons ) perform tasks require action understanding loosely defined . monkeys , Hickok said , evidence damage mirror neurons produces deficits action observation . claims individual cells remain difficult corroborate empirically , investigators today choose words carefully . Monkeys “ mirror neurons , ” humans “ mirroring systems , ” “ neural mirroring ” “ action - observation network . ” ( According Hickok , monkey research shifted focus mirroring effects networks systems . ) Quandt , considers mirror neuron centrist , makes claims different experiences change function individual cells based EEG experiments . said , “ completely convinced ” parts human sensorimotor system involved parsing processing people gestures . “ 100 percent sure true , ” said . “ lot convince . ” Researchers able pinpoint exact cells help communicate learn bodies , overlap multisensory systems undeniable .

Te explicamos por qué sucedió esto . HONG KONG — Las protestas que han sacudido Hong Kong este verano comenzaron con una inmensa manifestación inicios de junio en contra de un proyecto de ley impopular . Desde entonces , se han convertido en un movimiento más amplio en contra del poder de Pekín en este territorio semiautónomo . Durante varias semanas , se han vuelto más frecuentes los choques violentos entre jóvenes manifestantes y la policía , y las exigencias de los manifestantes se han vuelto más diversas y ambiciosas . Los activistas han tomado oficinas gubernamentales , han detenido el transporte público y han hecho pintas sobre símbolos de la autoridad de China . Además , el uso de la fuerza policiaca en contra de los manifestantes , junto con el fracaso para evitar un ataque multitudinario pasajeros del metro , ha hecho que la conducta de los policías sea un tema central . continuación , presentamos una guía sobre qué detonó las protestas , cómo evolucionaron y por qué es relevante . Hong Kong , un centro financiero internacional ubicado en la costa sur de China , fue una colonia británica hasta 1997 , cuando devolvieron la ciudad China conforme una política conocida como “ un país , dos sistemas ” . La política hizo que Hong Kong fuera parte de China , pero le permitió mantener muchas libertades que se les niegan los ciudadanos en el continente , entre ellas la libertad de expresión , el acceso sin restricciones internet y el derecho de reunión . El territorio tiene sus propias leyes , su sistema de gobierno y su fuerza policial , todo lo cual se encuentra bajo una miniconstitución conocida como la Ley Básica . China prometió que este sistema iba permanecer hasta 2047 , por lo menos . Sin embargo , muchos hongkoneses sienten que Pekín ya está socavando su autonomía y que el gobierno local obedece sus órdenes . Un comité pro - Pekín es el encargado de nombrar al máximo líder del territorio , el jefe ejecutivo : en la actualidad , la lideresa Carrie Lam . Además , el aparato de seguridad de China ha realizado intrusiones problemáticas en el territorio de Hong Kong , entre ellas el secuestro de vendedores de libros y de un multimillonario nacido en China . En febrero , el gobierno local presentó un proyecto de ley en la legislatura de Hong Kong — que está llena de legisladores pro - China—. Dicho proyecto permitiría que la gente acusada de algún crimen fuera enviada lugares con los cuales Hong Kong tiene un tratado de extradición , incluida China continental , donde los tribunales están bajo el control del Partido Comunista . Lam , la jefa ejecutiva , arguyó que el proyecto de ley era necesario fin de garantizar la justicia para las víctimas . Lam mencionó que la ley se propuso por el caso de un hombre acusado de asesinar su novia en Taiwán que luego evadió la justicia huyendo Hong Kong . Los críticos aseguran que el proyecto de ley permitirá que Pekín detenga disidentes en Hong Kong por cargos falsos . El 9 de junio , cientos de miles de personas , entre ellas gente de la tercera edad y familias con hijos , se unieron una marcha para oponerse al proyecto de ley . El 12 de junio , el debate y las exigencias cambiaron , cuando la policía utilizó gas pimienta , garrotes y más de 150 latas de gas lacrimógeno para dispersar miles de manifestantes , de entre los cuales una pequeña cantidad había lanzado proyectiles la policía . La violencia aumentó la presión sobre Lam , quien el 15 de junio suspendió la ley de extradición y , posteriormente , dijo que el proyecto estaba “ muerto ” . Sin embargo , se rehusó abandonarlo por completo . Los manifestantes la consideran una acción medias y han insistido en la retirada formal del proyecto de ley , así como la renuncia de Lam y una investigación en torno al uso de la fuerza policial . Impulsados por la furia en contra de la policía , así como por la lenta erosión de las libertades civiles , las protestas , que en general tienen líderes , se han transformado en un movimiento más generalizado y complicado : sobre la protección de las libertades , la democracia y la autonomía de Hong Kong . Las manifestaciones han continuado y la mayoría de los participantes han actuado sin violencia . Una marcha pacífica celebrada el 6 de junio fue la más grande en la historia de Hong Kong : se calcula una participación de hasta dos millones de personas . obstante , los choques entre la policía y jóvenes manifestantes vestidos con cascos , máscaras y camisetas negras han escalado de forma dramática . En julio , cientos de manifestantes tomaron el edificio del Consejo Legislativo , lo ocuparon durante horas y lo vandalizaron . Más tarde ese mismo mes , manifestantes realizaron pintas sobre el emblema nacional de China ubicado en la oficina principal del gobierno central en la ciudad . Esa noche , una multitud de más de cien hombres armados con varas atacó manifestantes y transeúntes en una estación de metro , donde lesionaron decenas . La policía llegó tarde y en un inicio arrestó nadie ; algunas de las personas que fueron arrestadas después al parecer tienen vínculos con grupos del crimen organizado conocidos como triadas . El episodio impactó la ciudad y da la impresión de haber profundizado la ira en contra de la policía , pues se le acusa de permitir el ataque . Los manifestantes se han vuelto más fluidos en sus tácticas , al moverse de un lugar otro por toda la ciudad ( “ Sé agua ” , una frase del difunto actor hongkonés Bruce Lee , se ha convertido en una consigna ) . Han rodeado estaciones de la policía , han lanzado ladrillos y han empezado incendios , y la policía ha redoblado el uso de gas lacrimógeno . El 5 de agosto , los manifestantes realizaron protestas en varias partes de la ciudad , bloquearon trenes y caminos , e hicieron un llamado la gente de Hong Kong para que se quedara en su casa después del trabajo , lo cual aparentemente ocurrió . Pekín ha respaldado Lam y poco poco ha aumentado sus advertencias hacia los manifestantes . Sin embargo , los funcionarios chinos en su mayoría le han dejado Lam la responsabilidad de sofocar los disturbios . Lam se ha negado hacer más concesiones desde que suspendió la ley de extradición y parece sentirse confiada en que su gobierno puede soportar el descontento . El 5 de agosto , Lam acusó los manifestantes de desafiar al gobierno chino al decir que “ quieren derrocar Hong Kong , destruir por completo el modo de vida que aprecian siete millones de personas ” . Lam mencionó que el movimiento podía llevar la ciudad “ al borde de una situación muy peligrosa ” . Un día después , Yang Guang , un funcionario de la oficina de vinculación con Hong Kong en Pekín , realizó la advertencia más grave de China : “ Quiero advertir todos los criminales que juzguen la situación de una manera equivocada y que piensen que nuestro control es una debilidad ” . Un “ golpe de la espada de la ley les está esperando en el futuro ” , expresó . Sin embargo , Yang dijo cómo Hong Kong o China podrían resolver la crisis . Aunque en julio el ejército chino insinuó que estaba listo para intervenir , funcionarios locales han negado que hubieran planeado solicitar una intervención militar , que está permitida por la Ley Básica . El presidente Xi Jinping se ha abstenido de comentar en público sobre la crisis . La policía ha arrestado cientos de personas , los activistas también han exigido que se liberen los prisioneros , y el ciclo de protestas , choques y alteración tiene un fin claro la vista .
