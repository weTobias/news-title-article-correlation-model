1305,"Nikki Bella Now Believes John Cena Wants Kids, But Wedding Still Off","John Cena's very public campaign to win back Nikki Bella is working, but she's still not ready to seal the deal with the wrestling/movie star. Nikki tells TMZ, John's public hand-wringing -- including posting a photo of John Cusack holding the boombox over his head in the film ""Say Anything"" -- has convinced her his change of heart about wanting kids wasn't hollow. She says, ""I believe 100% he wants kids. It makes me want to run back and jump into his arms."" She says she believes he's now sincere that he wants children ... which was the deal breaker that caused her to break up with him. Until this week, Nikki believed she had forced John to say what she wanted to hear so she'd take a walk down the aisle. Here's the problem ... Nikki says it's kind of been like a Pandora's Box. The conflict over children has raised issues in her head about the relationship. She says, ""I care about him and love him a lot,"" but now she has to do some serious thinking about the turn in their relationship and feel if it's still right. She says she's really hurt by the buzz that the whole conflict -- and even the relationship -- is fake to goose ratings for her reality show and John's career. She says, ""A lot of people get married for publicity. I'm not like those reality show people. I don't want to be hesitant. I want to do what my heart says."" Nikki says she has no idea what she'd say if John comes face-to-face with her and begs her to marry him. She says, ""I'm a girl who lives in the moment and I honestly don't know what I'd say.""",4.5
6528,"Rouhani says Iran will keep producing missiles, state TV reports","DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran will continue to produce missiles for its defense and does not consider that a violation of international accords, President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday in a speech broadcast on state television.  Rouhani spoke days after the U.S. House of Representatives voted for new sanctions against Iran’s ballistic missile program, part of an effort to clamp down on Tehran without immediately moving to undermine an international nuclear agreement.  He also meet the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog in Tehran, who again vouched for Iran’s compliance with the 2015 accord that curbed its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, which has drawn fire from U.S. President Donald Trump.  “We have built, are building and will continue to build missiles, and this violates no international agreements,” Rouhani said in a speech in parliament.   The United States has already imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran, saying its missile tests violate a U.N. resolution, that calls on Tehran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.  Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and says it has no plans to build nuclear-capable missiles.  Rouhani also criticized the United States over Trump’s refusal this month to formally certify that Tehran is complying with the accord on Iran’s nuclear program, even though international inspectors say it is.    “You are disregarding past negotiations and agreements approved by the U.N. Security council and expect others to negotiate with you?” Rouhani said.  “Because of the behavior it has adopted, America should forget any future talks and agreement with other countries,” Rouhani added, referring to unnamed countries in East Asia, an apparent reference to North Korea.  Yukiya Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), met Rouhani, President of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi, and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Tehran, an IAEA statement said.  “Director General Amano reiterated that the nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran are being implemented, and that the JCPOA represents a clear gain from a verification point of view,” it said, using an abbreviation for the 2015 accord.  “For the future, he stressed the importance of full implementation by Iran of its nuclear-related commitments in order to make the JCPOA sustainable.”  Trump’s decision not to certify Iranian compliance with the landmark nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers means Congress now has less than 60 days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the agreement that Amano’s agency is in charge of policing.  Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Tehran will stick to the agreement as long as the other signatories do, but will “shred” the deal if Washington pulls out, as Trump has threatened to do.  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has pressed the IAEA to seek access to Iranian military bases to ensure that they are not concealing activities banned by the nuclear deal.  Asked whether Amano had made any requests for new inspections, Salehi said after meeting Amano: “He has no request in this area,” Iran’s state news agency IRNA reported.  Salehi said Iran could resume production of 20 percent enriched uranium in four days, but did not want the Iran deal to fall apart.  U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday that he could not imagine the United States ever accepting a nuclear North Korea, and stressed during a week-long trip to Asia that diplomacy was America’s preferred course.

32116,"The Saudis tried to rip out a security camera after Khashoggi murder, Turkish media says"," Employees at the Saudi consulate in Turkey where journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered tampered with security camera footage in an attempt to cover up his death, according to a report from Turkish media out Tuesday.  Staff at the consulate allegedly tried to rip out a camera and also tamper with cameras at the security booth outside of the building, in the Turkish capital Istanbul. Turkish officials say Khashoggi was strangled and dismembered the moment he entered the building to get a document so he could marry his fiancée, who was waiting for him outside. Khashoggi’s body is still missing over a month after the murder.  The Oct. 2 death of the Washington Post columnist and prominent critic of the Saudi royal family has sparked international outrage, as the Saudis have changed their story several times and dragged their feet on an investigation. The revelations about the cameras are the latest in a pile of mounting evidence that Saudi officials are attempting to cover up Khashoggi’s murder. The day that Khashoggi was scheduled to visit the consulate, Turkish staff were reportedly told to take the day off. Mustafa al-Madani, allegedly part of a 15-man hit squad sent to kill Khashoggi, left the consulate wearing Khashoggi’s clothes and a fake beard and glasses. Turkish officials say he was a “body double” meant to create the illusion that Khashoggi had left the building.  On Oct. 20, Saudi officials finally admitted that Khashoggi was dead. The Saudi narrative surrounding his death has repeatedly shifted, with the government only recently acknowledging it was probably a premeditated murder. Initially, the Saudi state media said that a quarrel in the consulate led to “a fistfight that lead to his death.”  Khashoggi’s death has put a strain on the U.S.’s relations with Saudi Arabia.

35477,Elon Musk’s nonprofit can help AI systems get smarter — even if their developers have bad intentions,"OpenAI, the nonprofit backed by Elon Musk and Peter Thiel to promote artificial intelligence that helps rather than harms humanity, opened a new virtual training center on Monday. It’s called Universe, and anyone building artificial intelligence programs can use it. With Universe, developers can train artificial intelligence applications with games, websites, web browsers and other apps. The idea here is that the more an AI system practices using interfaces designed for human users, the more human-like AI can become. But since Universe is open for anyone to use, that leaves the door open to developers who may utilize Universe to train AI in a way that would beget harm — precisely what Musk’s nonprofit aims to prevent. Opening developer tools is common in artificial intelligence programming, so the new initiative falls within standard practice. Musk’s nonprofit is committed to open sourcing its tools and research as a way of hedging against the possibility of centralized, monopoly power over how artificial intelligence advances. Google opened its DeepMind artificial intelligence training tools on Monday, too. And earlier this year, OpenAI released another open platform for training algorithms in complex environments called Gym. This openness, however, potentially runs counter to Open AI’s purpose: To prevent Skynet from becoming self-aware. “As our algorithms grow more sophisticated and our environments grow, we will be carefully thinking how to ensure people train AIs to ensure they have a good understanding of ethics, responsibility and culpability,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told Recode. The team explored some of these issues in a recent paper and says they’re already working to build their own safe and secure systems. Still, that doesn’t answer the question of how they plan to prevent developers from using OpenAI’s free tools to build potentially unsafe and unethical artificial intelligence programs. Universe aims to make AI better by becoming more adept at “general intelligence,” a concept within the AI community in which an AI learns a broader array of tasks, rather than being designed for one specific purpose. Take Google’s AlphaGo, for example, the deep learning program that taught itself the ancient strategy game Go and defeated the best human player in the world earlier this year. AlphaGo’s win was considered a huge milestone in the development of artificial intelligence, but it wasn’t a demonstration of “general intelligence,” according to the team at OpenAI. Since the purpose of Universe is to edge AI closer to human-level intelligence, it uses virtual training environments that simulate how humans use computers by navigating the training exercises with mouse clicks and keyboard strokes. Universe’s style of training might amount to better and smarter artificially intelligent programs, but that doesn’t mean it will necessarily amount to more human-like AI. OpenAI partnered with large game makers, like Microsoft and Valve, to provide about a thousand different video games for developers to train with. There are also environments for AI programs to practice using web browsers or spreadsheets, design with CAD or use a photo editing program. This article originally appeared on Recode.net.",4.0
37209,Navy adding anti-ship missiles to its littoral combat ships,"The US Navy is moving ahead with plans to bolster the firepower of its littoral combat ships, adding new capabilities to the vessels that will improve their lethality and survivability in a conflict, a Lockheed Martin executive said Jan. 17. Plans are underway to equip the LCS with the Naval Strike Missile, an over-the-horizon anti-ship missile made by the Norwegian company Kongsberg Defence and Raytheon that Joe DePietro, Lockheed's vice president of small combatants and ship systems, described as having a ""long-range surface-to-surface capability that exceeds what the [Boeing-made] Harpoons can do today on current surface combatants."" The Navy also plans to add the Surface Electronic Warfare Information Program, or SEWIP, Block 2 electronic surveillance sensors to the vessels and the MK 53 Decoy Launching System, or Nulka, to protect against inbound missiles. DePietro said the service hopes to put the NSM on all LCS platforms, starting with those slated to deploy in 2020. ""Having some of these capabilities helps it to be in a position to be more 'a little bit scout, a little bit more offensive,' have a little more capability to be integrated with cruisers and destroyers,"" he said. The changes are being made to the ships — the oldest is less than 10 years old — out of concerns for their ability to handle a changing mission set. The LCS initially was built to conduct operations in the shallows, including defense, anti-surface warfare and mine counter-measures. It now will need to perform those missions and more as China and Russia assert their maritime power, DePietro said. ""What's been changing with our near-peer threats is really driving some of this. The flexibility of this ship allows it to go places where other ships can't go. But while we are putting it in these places, given the change in the threat, we need to have additional capabilities inherent to the ship,"" he said. Of the 32 LCSs the Navy plans to commission, 16 have been delivered, including LCSs 1-14, 16 and 18. The USS Wichita, LCS-13, was the most recent to be commissioned, earlier this month in Mayport, Florida. According to the Navy, 10 additional LCSs are under construction, and three are in the pre-construction phase. The LCS has been built in two variants: the Independence variant, built by Austal USA in Mobile, Alabama, and the Freedom variant, built by Lockheed and Fincantieri Marinette Marine in Marinette, Wisconsin. Of the Navy's current LCS fleet, seven are Freedom variants and nine are Independence. The modernization upgrades — being designed by Lockheed Martin — will go on both variants, DePietro said. The NSM has a range of more than 100 nautical miles and advanced target recognition capabilities that allow it to reach a target without needing additional ships or aircraft to maintain the track. The LCSs currently are equipped with a 57mm rapid-fire gun and launcher able to fire the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile, or RAM. It also can accommodate armed MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopters and unarmed MQ-8B Fire Scout aerial systems. The LCS program has had its share of setbacks and controversies, including problems over design and construction issues with the early ships and concerns about the class's survivability and effectiveness in battle. Three LCSs deployed between 2014 and 2016, with floats lasting from 18 to 23 months in the case of the USS Fort Worth, LCS-3, which was stuck in the port of Singapore for an extended period after experiencing a major setback when its combining gear was run without oil. The USS Coronado, LCS-4, also broke down on its way out to the Pacific. None of the ships deployed in 2018 due to maintenance scheduling issues. Navy officials said earlier this year that at least three LCSs will deploy in fall 2019. Last May, the Pentagon awarded a $14.8 million contract to Raytheon for the initial Naval Strike Missile buy. The contract is worth up to $847.6 million if all options are exercised. Lockheed is managing the design integration portion of the contract, starting with LCS-7, the USS Detroit.

38489,MSNBC Contributor Steve Schmidt Says Trump's to Blame for Bomb Scares,"President Trump bears some responsibility for the pipe bombs sent to Democrats, and anyone with ears should know that, says former GOP strategist Steve Schmidt. Steve told us Wednesday the person who actually assembled and sent the bombs is ultimately to blame -- but added, POTUS would have had metaphorical blood on his hands had the devices detonated ... because he's been condoning violence for years now. Schmidt, who's renounced the GOP and is now an MSNBC fixture, says Trump has encouraged his base to resort to violence against his enemies -- specifically Democrats and the media. Considering those were the groups targeted, Schmidt says it's clear Trump's rhetoric is spawning a pseudo Civil War. As we told you, multiple suspicious packages were discovered en route to the residences and offices of the Obamas, the Clintons, Eric Holder, Maxine Waters, CNN and more.

42888,Mueller news: did President Trump just tamper with a federal witness?,"Did the president of the United States just tamper with a federal witness? In a lively tweet on Monday morning, President Trump praised his longtime adviser Roger Stone for vowing not to testify against him. Stone is currently suspected of having possibly served as a conduit between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign. “I will never testify against Trump.” This statement was recently made by Roger Stone, essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about “President Trump.” Nice to know that some people still have “guts!” Some prominent lawyers, including George Conway, the husband of Trump’s White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, and Neal Katyal, a former solicitor general in the Obama administration, have suggested that Trump’s public lauding of Stone is part of a broader effort to dissuade Stone — and others, like former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort — from cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe. Witness tampering is a federal crime. But it’s notoriously difficult to prove in court because you have to show that someone is acting with the specific purpose of obstructing an official proceeding. Has Trump crossed that line with his latest tweet about Stone? Is there a legitimate case to be made against him in light of everything he has said and tweeted about Mueller’s probe so far? To find out, I reached out to nine legal experts and asked them those very questions. Their full responses, edited for clarity, are below. Trump’s tweets do look a lot like witness tampering, but it’s complicated because Trump is a politician who says a lot of things for many different purposes. To prove that Trump engaged in witness tampering, prosecutors would have to prove that he made those tweets with a corrupt intent — in other words, the intent to obstruct an official proceeding — and that he wrote with the intent to influence Stone’s testimony. Trump’s lawyers would argue that the purpose of his tweet was to influence the public, not Stone, and that they could have spoken to Stone’s attorney privately if Trump actually wanted to influence him. Trump says a great many things on Twitter and isn’t careful with his words, so some courts have concluded that his words can’t be taken literally or seriously. Prosecutors would likely respond that by speaking broadly to the public instead of privately to Stone, Trump was trying to influence Stone in a manner that gave him plausible deniability. They would point to Michael Cohen’s recent sentencing memorandum, in which his attorney said that Cohen lied in part due to Trump’s messaging. Are Trump’s tweets admissible evidence of witness tampering? Yes. Period. Would they be enough to convict a president who lies and cheats in plain view every week of the year, about matters small and huge, and gets away with it? Who knows? Neal Katyal says that the Department of Justice “prosecutes cases like this all the time.” Perhaps, but prosecutors sometimes push the envelope too far. Standing alone, I think it is a stretch to suggest that Trump’s latest tweet constitutes witness tampering. Stupid, unpresidential, par for the course — but not tampering by itself. Witness tampering is never a good look for a president. American presidents need to be extra careful about not even appearing to tamper with witnesses in criminal cases, especially if the criminal case could potentially involve liability for the president himself. The reason is that witness tampering can lead to impeachment. To wit, Article 1 of President Nixon’s impeachment included: “approving, condoning, acquiescing in, and counseling witnesses with respect to the giving of false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States and false or misleading testimony in duly instituted judicial and congressional proceedings …” Also, in a civil context, witness tampering was a charge in President Bill Clinton’s impeachment. Article III stated, “On or about December 17, 1997, William Jefferson Clinton corruptly encouraged a witness in a Federal civil rights action brought against him to execute a sworn affidavit in that proceeding that he knew to be perjurious, false and misleading.” The president’s most recent statements are further incidents of both obstruction and witness tampering. The relevant statutes prohibit attempts to impede federal investigations and attempts to induce witnesses to withhold testimony. The president appears to be doing both, and engaging in such conduct without art or subtlety is no excuse. Whether or not he succeeds, he has committed a crime. Issuing threats or inducements publicly does not make them legal. Nor can he claim that he has the lawful power as president to obstruct in this way, an argument he has made in the past with respect to personnel decisions such as the termination of FBI Director James Comey. We have seen similar statements before, but the violations keep getting more obvious and egregious, and seemingly more desperate as well. On the one hand, I understand where George Conway and Neal Katyal are coming from, because I assume they are putting this tweet in the context of reports that Trump has dangled pardons in return for witnesses’ lies and silence — and I, along with Randall Eliason and Laurence Tribe, have argued that such conduct is a felony bribery conspiracy, which could also put their lawyers in criminal jeopardy. On the other hand, taking such tweets on their own, how can it be felony tampering to publicly agree with a witness account, even if you know he’s lying? I say this with the caveat that this area is not in my expertise, but I am concerned that some are pushing obstruction statutes into ambiguous territory that could set them up for being overturned or sharply limited on unconstitutional vagueness grounds, similar to how Justice Gorsuch rightly ruled in the pro-immigrant Dimaya decision this year on the unclear meaning of “crimes of violence.” If a criminal defendant or his lawyers put out a statement denying the charges and simply agreeing with another defendant’s account, how can that be witness tampering? This interpretation is far too broad. Some suggest that Trump’s condemnation of Cohen around the same time is implicitly the context of a pardon dangle, but again, I think that’s a stretch. A defendant has to be able to speak publicly in his or her defense not under oath, even if that defense is false, unwise, and counterproductive. I think their argument against Trump makes more sense only if these commentators are taking into consideration the much broader context, including reports of pardon dangling. If they are assuming other contacts and other tampering, these tweets could be additional evidence (a mountain of evidence) of corrupt intent for other illegal acts, acts in furtherance of obstruction (and potentially part of a bribery conspiracy). Their argument may also make more sense as impeachable for high crimes and misdemeanors, which are abuses of power not limited to technical statutory felonies. I agree with Renato Mariotti that the context of Cohen’s sentencing memorandum on Friday, alleging past contacts with Trump’s lawyers to influence his testimony, is the most damning context, but I still suggest that background includes the criminal conduct, and these tweets are still evidence of corrupt intent rather than the criminal acts in themselves. I wouldn’t describe them as witness tampering. Instead, I would describe them as one data point in a continuing pattern of interference in the special counsel’s investigation. In one day, Trump has tweeted about Roger Stone’s loyalty while at the same time urging the judge to give Michael Cohen a harsh sentence. It would be one thing for a private citizen to speak up about a criminal investigation, but it’s quite another for the target of the investigation to speak up. And it’s even more worrisome when it is the target of the investigation who also uses his executive power to stymie the investigation by, for example, firing James Comey or Jeff Sessions. There are several factors that collectively suggest President Trump might be credibly accused of “witness tampering” in the Mueller investigation: 1. President Trump’s praise for Roger Stone’s guts for vowing not to testify against President Trump. 2. President Trump’s scorn for Michael Cohen’s “flipping.” 3. President Trump’s dangling a potential pardon for Paul Manafort. The president has made it clear he believes in “omertà” — the old criminal organizations’ code of silence. He characterized Manafort as strong before he entered his cooperation agreement with the special counsel, and did so again after Manafort broke that agreement. In contrast, he called Michael Cohen “weak” after he agreed to provide information to the special counsel. Now he is praising notorious political dirty trickster Roger Stone for his public declaration that he will “never” testify. The president’s public musings are clearly designed to undermine the Russia investigation and fortify those in his camp in their refusals to testify. Such conduct is inconsistent with the president’s constitutional oath of office, as well as his obligation to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” If this related to a military court-martial, the president’s comments would clearly constitute “undue command influence” that would require court remedies. However, here, without proof of either a specific threat or inducement, it would be very hard to prove statutory witness tampering based solely on President Trump’s statements coupled with the broader context of his power. But such evidence could be out there, and these statements suggest that is a line of inquiry congressional and law enforcement investigators should pursue.",3.0
44887,John McCain wants Google and Facebook to reveal who pays for political ads,"Three senators are putting pressure on internet giants like Facebook and Google to be more transparent about who is buying political ads on their sites in the wake of revelations that Russian-linked operatives placed ads on social media networks to sow division in the runup to the 2016 election. On Thursday, Republican Sen. John McCain announced he is joining Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner to co-sponsor the Honest Ads Act, which would require political ads sold on the internet to follow the same rules as ones sold on television, radio, and satellite networks, all of which have to disclose who is buying political advertising. “In the wake of Russia’s attack on the 2016 election, it is more important than ever to strengthen our defenses against foreign interference in our elections,” McCain said in a statement. “Unfortunately, US laws requiring transparency in political campaigns have not kept pace with rapid advances in technology, allowing our adversaries to take advantage of these loopholes to deceive millions of American voters with impunity.” The announcement is a response to Russia’s meddling in the last presidential election, senators said. It’s illegal for foreign entities to buy political ads in the US, but in the runup to the 2016 election, a Russian-backed “troll farm” purchased $100,000 worth of political ads on Facebook. The ads only came to light last month, when Facebook officials testified in front of Congress. Russian meddling in the election is usually framed as an issue of national security: A foreign power was able to interfere with the election process in the US. But the legislation looks at it another way — through the lens of campaign finance. The 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, a campaign finance law sponsored by McCain and Sen. Russ Feingold, banned foreign actors from buying political ads in the United States. The Honest Ads Act would amend the law to include internet ads in those requirements. “Political ads on the Internet are more popular now than ever,” Klobuchar wrote in an op-ed on the bill in the Washington Post. “But there is little transparency and accountability when it comes to disclosing information about these ads. And without transparency, there is no ability to know if foreign governments are purchasing the ads. This leaves our election system vulnerable to foreign influence.” The 2002 McCain-Feingold legislation was an attempt to inject transparency into political advertising, and part of a broader effort to cut down on attack ads. The law put limits on so-called “soft money,” how much political parties and interest groups could spend. But one of its most recognizable impacts was that political candidates had to provide a voiceover at the end of their ads, saying, “I am [insert candidate name here], and I approve this message.” The ultimate goal was to give voters more information about the groups putting political ads on television, radio, and satellite networks. But by the current law, internet companies don’t have to play by the same rules, because the law was written before the internet became the main way people communicate about politics. In 2006, the Federal Election Commission decided the internet could be exempt from these rules, after pressure from bloggers concerned about free speech. In its decision, the FEC wrote that the internet was “a unique and evolving mode of mass communication and political speech that is distinct from other media in a manner that warrants a restrained regulatory approach.” By 2017, a majority of American adults — 67 percent — got their news through social media, according to a study last month from the Pew Research Center. Facebook is a key news source; 45 percent primarily get their news from the social network, making it an important place for candidates, campaigns, and political parties to advertise during national and state elections. The lack of transparency online made it easy for Russian influence to go undetected during the busy 2016 campaign season. Besides the $100,000 the Russians spent on Facebook ads, Google recently revealed that Russian operatives bought “tens of thousands of dollars” in ads on YouTube, Gmail, and other platforms before the election. In the past, social media companies have resisted these kinds of rules. The $100,000 in Russian ad spending on Facebook is dwarfed by the more than $1 billion total spent on digital political ads during the 2016 campaign. In 2011, Facebook asked the FEC to apply something known as the “small item” exemption to political ads on their website, arguing that because they had limited ad space, there wasn’t enough room to include a disclosure saying who paid for the ad. Ultimately, the FEC never issued a decision, leaving Facebook free to do what it wanted. Framing disclosure rules as a way to fight foreign influence might make that resistance more difficult, but tech companies are unlikely to accept it passively — as the New York Times’s Kenneth Vogel and Cecilia Kang reported, they’re assembling their own team of lobbyists and lawyers to try to shape the legislation as much as possible. Russian interference in the 2016 election took on many forms, just one of which was political advertising. So far, Facebook seems to be where Russian-linked operatives spent the most money on political ads. The Russians spent about $100,000 on Facebook ads, compared to the “tens of thousands” they spent on ads at Google. It appears that two different entities linked to the Russian government placed ads on Facebook and Google, meaning that the effort could have been more widespread than previously believed. Some of the ads were for specific candidates, including Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, and the Green Party’s Jill Stein, but many highlighted politically divisive issues, including race relations, LGBTQ rights, immigration, and gun control. For example, some ads took advantage of divisive social issues in America, promoting activist groups like Black Lives Matter, while other Russian ads suggested Black Lives Matter was a threat, according to the Washington Post. Other ads tried to stoke religious fears, saying that Muslim women had voted for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The Russians deployed many other tactics, including recruiting US activists to stage protests for the civil rights of black Americans, according to an investigation by the Russian news site RBC. They also created thousands of fake accounts on Facebook and Twitter that linked back to their own websites, filled with hacked material on Hillary Clinton and prominent Democrats like businessman and investor George Soros, a New York Times investigation found. It is unclear how successful the so-called Russian “troll farm” on Facebook was. Many of the accounts were crudely designed and used stilted, awkward language, and many of their posts were not widely shared throughout social media. The majority of the posts ran in 2015, the year before the election, when Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were still competing with other candidates in the primaries, the Times investigation found. Facebook recently announced that it is taking new steps to crack down on fake accounts, saying it wouldn’t allow pages to advertise on its site if they repeatedly posted fake content, and that it has been increasingly monitoring and shutting down the fake accounts.",3.5
53878,Bay Area Protests Trump's Child Detention Policy with Billboard and Projection,"A clandestine modification of a junk removal billboard and a nighttime projection of a political cartoon called out the president’s family separation policy. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Is the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) advertising its brutal practice of separating migrant families? If you were driving along Interstate 80 in California’s East Bay last night or early this morning, you might have seen what appeared to be a billboard for ICE flaunting its inhumane expertise — “We make kids disappear” — alongside the Munchian image of a shocked and screaming child. The ignoble advertisement is in fact the work of satiric and shadowy public art collective Indecline, whose members scaled the billboard (which formerly promoted 1-800-Got-Junk?’s ability to “make junk disappear”) in the night and transformed it into a provocative indictment of ICE. At the time this article was published, a spokesperson for Indecline said that the modified billboard was still in place. Indecline’s rogue gesture wasn’t the only monumental expression of artistic outrage with President Trump’s inhumane immigration policy — which has resulted in some 2,300 children being separated, seemingly indefinitely, from their parents — in the Bay Area this week. On Monday night, an image of a comic blasting the practice was projected onto San Francisco’s Federal Building. That comic that got @Rob_Rogers fired? Now it’s projected on the SF Federal Building. #FamilySeparation #FamiliesBelongTogether #KeepingFamiliesTogetherAct pic.twitter.com/LFqdsddTGb — ÆMarling (@AEMarling) June 19, 2018  The comic is the work of celebrated political cartoonist Rob Rogers, whom the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette fired last week after refusing to run 19 of his comics since the beginning of the year, as the Washington Post reported. One of the last ones he made during his 25 years as the paper’s editorial cartoonist, it depicts a roadside “Caution” sign in which the silhouette of President Trump abducts a child as its parents flee. Though the Post-Gazette refused to publish that one as well, it was reproduced widely through syndication and social media. I am back at the drawing table today working on an immigration cartoon for syndication tomorrow. Until then, I figure this killed cartoon is worth a repost. #TrumpandtheBabySnatchers #TrumpCamps #Trump #ImmigrantChildren #Immigration pic.twitter.com/EtZ6LTtR28 — Rob Rogers (@Rob_Rogers) June 18, 2018  Rogers himself even endorsed the nighttime projection of his work, retweeting the original photo by fantasy author A.E.

55514,The Pick-Me-Up: ‘Rez Infinite’,"As the great Satoru Iwata once noted: ""Above all, video games are meant to just be one thing: fun for everyone."" Whether you agree or not, games can certainly cheer you up when you're feeling low. With that in mind, Chris Schilling's column The Pick-Me-Up focuses on games that can make you smile in just ten minutes. Today's selection is Rez Infinite: SEGA's classic rail shooter has been remade for 2016 and is best experienced in VR, but it's also playable on PS4 without headset immersion. Until this year, I was a VR skeptic. It wasn't that I believed the hardware was too costly to take off for a mainstream audience, rather that I didn't necessarily think it was a great idea to immerse yourself in the world to the exclusion of everything else. I wasn't convinced such an escape was needed, or even particularly healthy. I didn't feel like I'd ever be able to forget I was wearing a heavy device on my head with two screens positioned worryingly close to my eyes. I figured I'd always be aware of the artifice of inhabiting a space or a body that wasn't really there.  Then I played Rez Infinite. Rez, when it came out for PS2 and Dreamcast in 2001, felt like a game from somewhere other than the present, a hypnotic missive sent back from the future by an optimistic time-traveller, played on a medium that wasn't quite ready to deliver that message in the way intended. But now, to quote The Six Million Dollar Man's Oscar Goldman, we have the technology. VR is Rez's natural home: the sights and, more importantly, the sounds of its world can now completely surround you. It's here that designer Tetsuya Mizuguchi's long-standing fascination with synaesthesia, the phenomenon whereby a stimulus applied to one sense can trigger an involuntary reaction within another, can be more fully understood. The pulsing rhythm of its wireframe worlds isn't just heard, but felt.  At times, the sensation is mildly euphoric; at others you'll feel strangely relaxed. Aiming by looking allows you to lock onto targets almost without thinking, letting you hold and release the X button to cue in extra percussion instinctively. There are revelations, too, even for those who know the original game and its HD remake backwards, like the exhilarating moment you physically turn around to see Area 4's boss, a towering figure composed of purple blocks, sprinting after you. But even that pales next to Area X, the dreamy new world created specifically for VR. I simply can't fathom playing it on a regular screen, even though I technically could. In truth, it's perhaps closer in spirit to Mizuguchi's woefully underrated Child of Eden, trading Rez's sharp edges and ominous beats for brighter, more uplifting themes in an infinite space filled with glowing particles of light. These form abstract shapes and structures, around which creatures dart like marine life from the darkest recesses of the sea floor. I began to imagine my PS VR helmet was actually a scuba mask—and, as I released them from their corporeal form in a burst of shimmering neon, I felt almost like I was swimming through an interactive firework display. That probably sounds silly, but Rez Infinite is the kind of experience that's difficult to effectively put into words without lapsing into babbling hyperbole. If I said it gave me something close to an out-of-body experience, it would sound like the worst kind of dribbling fanboy nonsense. It would also be completely true. On a rainy winter afternoon in a grim, grey suburb of Stockport, I briefly ascended to the stars. I returned to Earth a VR convert, feeling happier than I'd been in weeks.

55954,Miley Cyrus's 'Black Mirror' Episode Is a Creepy Dive Into How We Ruin Pop Stars,"In the episode, titled “Rachel, Jack, and Ashley Too,” Cyrus plays pop queen Ashley O, a bubblegum icon clad in bodycon two-pieces and a signature magenta wig. She's an on-the-nose mishmash of  Teenage Dream-era Katy Perry and early 2010s Ariana Grande, performing lyrics like ""So full of ambition and verve / I'm gonna get what I deserve"" in an (admittedly catchy) music video that looks just like that of Grande's abandoned single “Focus.” Miley Cyrus is also, obviously, playing an early era of herself; the wig alone is a potent callback to  Hannah Montana that fans immediately glommed onto after seeing her in the season trailer. Like Cyrus, Ashley O rises to fame as a kid-friendly role model that you might find on the cover of  Tiger Beat.  The episode follows her attempts to shift gears and create her own material, against the will of an abusive manager who—besides being her aunt and adoptive parent—insists on keeping her on an inoffensive track of optimistic bops even as her mental health suffers. It's a familiar arc of so many films about pop celebrity—reminiscent of Ally's SNL moment in  A Star is Born, and seen in similar themes in  Vox Lux. But there are also more serious shades of real-life managerial abuse and exploitative legal bindings, calling to mind rising stars like JoJo, who was locked in a ten-year battle with her label after signing a contract at just 12 years old, and, of course, Kesha, who was unable to successfully release herself from a recording contract with producer Dr. Luke despite filing a civil lawsuit against him for sexual assault.  As all non-conforming parts of Ashley O's personality are shoved to the wayside, her public image must be continually maintained and distributed through merchandising and album releases. The notion of a celebrity herself becoming disposable while her image lives on through commodities is hardly a new one, but  Black Mirror uses technology to bring this story to its most heightened state. Under pressure from her aunt, Ashley O releases an AI-powered doll named ""Ashley Too"" that's crafted from her own brain scan. In a signature  Black Mirror twist, her manager then literally disposes of her (I won't share how, to avoid spoilers), but continues to create Ashley O’s music with the help of more technology. Later, her aunt unveils a hologram of Ashley O named ""Ashley Eternal"" that can go on tour indefinitely or even be projected into anyone's living room at their convenience.  The essential format of  Black Mirror, and its signature heavy-handed ominousness about the future, focuses on the ethics of commodification but shies away from digging deeper into the exploitation of pop stars. The annoying, robotic Ashley Too—with her sleek, white, almost Apple-like design, topped by that bright magenta wig—places a focus on a fan relationship that steals about half the episode, and isn't at all suspenseful. And while the Ashley Eternal hologram makes sense as a lucrative live-tour substitute (and the optics of replacing a flesh-and-blood human with a CG image is an effective kind of body horror), it fundamentally misses the mark on what actually makes a pop star ""eternal,"" and detracts from a bigger discussion about the humanity—or lack thereof—of celebrity culture. Though image control is certainly essential for stars, it's not pandering to fans—or constantly seeking new revenue streams, with or without these kinds of technology—that give stars their staying power these days. Longevity in the spotlight actually depends on new ""phases"" and ""transformations,"" leaving pop queens to constantly vie for power and relevancy via the rebirth of their art and image as they age. Lady Gaga ascended as Mother Monster before shifting to her more natural look in  A Star is Born; Ariana Grande transformed from sweet innocence in a sundress to a ""dangerous woman""; Britney Spears went from 90s babydoll to rock bottom to Vegas residency; Beyoncé evolved countless times from Destiny's Child to Beychella; and Madonna created her entire brand around high-drama metamorphosis. While each of these artists clung to certain evergreen elements of their brand—Grande with her Mariah-esque vocal stylings and high ponytail, Gaga and Madonna with their theatricality—they were able to meet demand as our hunger evolved. What the episode fails to consider is that if stars don't change, or change in a way that doesn’t garner attention, someone will swoop in to take their place. And worse yet, a successful rebrand in music isn't the only way to maintain publicity and relevance, in a world where any form of drama makes headlines. Fame is fed by bad decisions as much as good ones. At moments when pop stars flounder under the spotlight, their poor mental health still grabs eyeballs: Spears' fame was sustained by her post-divorce shaved head; Grande's successful album  Sweetener is informed by the atrocities of the Manchester bombing, a broken engagement with Pete Davidson, and Mac Miller taking his life. And the narratives of Kesha and JoJo's comebacks have also been fueled by their mismanagement and alleged abuse.  Cyrus herself made a career off of a rambunctious rebrand from Disney’s golden child to a naked, wrecking-ball-riding iconoclast. There was outrage from her old audience, but the self-assuredness and utter audacity of her behavior—and all that publicity, both positive and negative—helped her shake off her kid-friendly image and embrace a new, larger fanbase.  In  Black Mirror, while Ashley O's manager understands the marketability of the pop star's fall from grace, the episode doesn't seem to acknowledge that a toy or a hologram isn't the answer. (Nevermind the fact that holographic performers already exist, and in practice, they make people feel weird.) Pop stars are already commodities. We'd rather see drama and consequences play out in their real lives than see them continue on a predictable trajectory, because we already see them as entertainment rather than fully formed people.  For an episode that purports to focus on the nature and exploitations of pop stardom, it raises some interesting points about how celebrity image is a game of puppetry. But ultimately, like a concert that’s just a hologram, it can't quite capture the nature of pop stardom at all.  Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.

56769,Graphic: America's economy and wages are cooling but not its female workforce,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Data released on Friday showed a return to strong job growth in the United States, allaying some fears the U.S. economy is on a short path to recession. But the data also reinforced the view that economic growth is slowing.  Here are five take-aways from a report by the U.S. Labor Department on U.S. employment during June.  Every month the Labor Department surveys payrolls in the private sector to calculate how many hours employees across the nation worked. Seen as a proxy for economic growth, this index of the national work effort grew 0.2% in June, a rate near the muted gains clocked in recent months. That suggests the U.S. economy, which grew at a 3.1% annual rate in the first quarter of this year, could be cooling.   Growth in private sector average hourly earnings accelerated throughout 2018 and through February of this year, when year-over-year growth hit the strongest rate since 2009 at 3.4%. June’s growth rate, however, was a more modest 3.1%. It is probably too early to tell if there has been a break in the upward trend.    The manufacturing sector added 17,000 jobs in June after several months of weak growth or outright decline. Wage growth in the factory sector, however, has underperformed the national average. Wage growth has also been lower in the education and health jobs category tracked by the Labor Department.   A bright spot for the U.S. economy over the last few years has been the increase in the share of the population that either has a job or is looking for one. This so-called labor force participation rate ticked slightly higher in June, both for a key demographic of people of prime working age and for the general population. But the rate for prime-age workers has been mostly falling since January. This suggests the economy might be running lower on its supply of people available to work, which could depress future job growth.    In June, the participation rate fell for men of prime working age, while it rose for women. This is in line with the trend over the last few years. Indeed, the share of men who have jobs or are looking for one was slightly lower in June than it was in January 2017.

57317,Native New Yorkers Reflect on the Death of the 'Village Voice',"On Friday, the owner of the Village Voice told his staff that the iconic New York City alt-weekly, which shuttered its print edition after 62 years last August, will no longer publish new stories on its website. ""Today is kind of a sucky day,"" owner Peter Barbey said in a private phone call to staff, according to Gothamist. ""In recent years, the Voice has been subject to the increasingly harsh economic realities facing those creating journalism and written media,"" Barbey added in a statement. To New Yorkers like myself, the news felt like learning a chronically ill friend had died. The Voice was an integral part of the landscape of the city—Manhattan was crowded with those gnarled, graffiti-covered plastic boxes full of free copies of the city's rowdier, weirder alternative to the Daily News, New York Post, and New York Times. As an East Village native, I began reading the paper early on, mostly because my parents adored it so much. In a sense, the paper died when it went out of print, but as long as the website was running, something called the Village Voice  existed. Now it doesn't.  As a tween and beyond, I remember excitedly picking up a copy each Wednesday, the distinct smell and texture of a freshly printed copy that had yet to be leafed through. I'd quizzically examine the pornographic classifieds in the back of the paper, heed the movie reviews and local theater listings, devour the Tom Tomorrow comic strips. ""The print pages of The Village Voice... was where many New Yorkers learned to be New Yorkers,"" the Times wrote last year after the print edition ended. It's a sad day for media, and a sad day for New York. I asked six writers who are from New York to reflect on the death of the Village Voice: I went to New York University in the early 1990s and stacks of the Village Voice were everywhere. College was an exercise in defying the wishes of my Haitian immigrant mom. NYU was supposed to be the first step on my road to becoming a lawyer, someone with a “good job” that she could brag about. But my first constitutional law course disabused me of any notion that I wanted to do that. After I took “Minorities in the Media” for credit requirements, Professor David Dent (a VICE contributor) told me I should consider journalism as a career. He told me I had talent, but I wondered if I actually could do it.  The Village Voice, goddamn them, made me think I could. The alt-weekly was one of the first places I saw black cultural traditions talked about with both familial love and critical rigor. The conversations I’d have with other black students and some of my journalism professors often swung between two poles: How They Talk About Us and How We Talk about Ourselves. A grown-up version of that same energy was in the articles by Nelson George, Thulani Davis, Lisa Jones and Greg Tate. The Voice was a place where I realized we could push back against the lazy zombie narratives foisted on black folks by non-blacks. A place where we could celebrate, reclaim, and deconstruct the black contributions that helped make New York the greatest city in the world. We’re still having conversations on that Them/Us continuum today, in ways that feel more fraught and explosive than ever. The Village Voice was a place that showed me that, if you want people to give a damn about black creativity, sometimes you gotta blow shit up, both literally and figuratively.  Evan Narcisse is a journalist, critic, and the writer of Rise of the Black Panther  for Marvel Comics.  My dad never bought the New York Times or the Post or the Daily News. Instead, every morning when he'd pick up Entenmann's cakes and coffee at the deli downstairs, he'd come back up with the Village Voice and the New York Press, rivals at the time. Those papers were where I first learned about my city, whether it was politics or weird local news or shows I'd beg my parents to let me go to. We even cut out the weekly comic strips and use them to plaster our bathroom walls. The Press died years ago, but something about the Voice seemed eternal, even with the recent years of change and strife. Maybe it's just because I'd walk by their building off Astor Place all the time growing up. They felt permanent. I got to write for them for the first time last year, and while it felt cool, it's hitting me now how amazing it was that I got to contribute to a place that educated me so much. I don't know if I'll ever know my city as well as they did.  Jaya Saxena  is the co-author of  Basic Witches, and contributes to GQ  and the Establishment.  As a kid growing up in the city-suburban borderlands of New York, the Voice was  everything to me. It was this remarkable window into the fucked up world that the city was—and still very much  is—down to its goddamn core, from the crooked politics that gave us Donald Trump, to the totally offbeat film, music, and culture that could really only live here, here in New York City. And I loved it so much for being just that. So getting to work and write there as a college student, and even after, was a batshit dream come true. I had relatively no clips to my name, but my peers there let me have goo-goo-eyed fun in a city that was relatively new to me at the time—an opportunity not many 20-year-olds get, and one that I am greatly indebted to years later. And I had a  ball.  But in its waning days, the Voice was never  not in turmoil. You'd pass hallways hung with stories by legends like Wayne Barrett, Tom Robbins, or Michael Musto, to attend staff meetings where you'd learn that your colleagues and friends were being laid off because of a bunch of  Barbarians at the Gates–like corporate raiders who said so. They ripped this institution apart, and will forever be guilty for that. But so it goes, I guess, in New York: Dreams come here to live, and all too often die. We obsess over finding The Next Best Thing here a lot. But nothing will replace the Voice. And nothing ever should.    John Surico is a journalist who writes often for VICE, as well as the New York Times and others. He worked at the Voice from 2011 to 2013.  To my parents, the New York Times was the local gold standard in journalism, but to me, it was the Village Voice. The Voice was sharp, cool, smart, and mean, which was what you aspired to be as a rebellious-but-not-too-rebellious teen in Manhattan. I fangirled every time I walked by the Voice office in Cooper Square, dreaming of the day I too got to curse in print. I'm still bummed I didn't write anything for them, and more bummed for everyone else who never will.  Rebecca Fishbein is a freelance writer who's contributed to VICE as well as Jezebel, the Cut, Gothamist, and others.  I grew up commuting to the city for school from a suburb my immigrant family wasn’t welcome in, and was always overwhelmed by the sheer amount of cultural capital the kids around me had. One of the few things that helped was the Village Voice, which was usually brought to school by some other kid and discarded in the corner of the student lounge for me to find. I read every page every week, including (and especially) the once-incredibly-dense and then eventually waning back pages, which advertised everything I could possibly dream would be part of my world as an adult and also several things that had never occurred to me that human bodies could do. The V illage Voice made me realize what existed outside the boundaries of my rule-bound, achievement-driven home life, and I could not be more grateful. Rupa Bhattacharya is the editor-in-chief of MUNCHIES. Growing up here, the Village Voice was the secret map to the city I KNEW was there but had only seen glimpses of. The thing you picked up to find a job and ended up reading about corruption and art and all the other things that matter. Someone was always lamenting about how it wasn’t it was, kinda like New York City. As a grown-up, I got to edit its main competitor at the time, New York Press, and then to work briefly at the Voice. By the time I got to both those places, they truly weren’t what they were. It’s a grand feeling though to have been part of these un-pedigreed, angry, whip-smart outlets full of journalists, too often men but also many brilliant women, who were cocksure about their obsessions—and to have been some small part of some 17-year-old’s semi-golden age. To have been around a ton of brilliant, driven, and tormented journalists—many of em who could have been making more money somewhere else and some of em who couldn’t possibly have functioned anywhere else—who were going to keep doing this until the alt-weekly business model completely collapsed. Instead of lamenting what was and ain’t no more, we need to respect the people who were reporting and writing stories and capturing scenes that matter than and continue doing that work now.  ""p.s.

60069,This Video Game Teaches You to Be a 'Winemaking Tycoon'," Other than writing, there are only two or three other jobs that I think I might be qualified to do, and that's assuming that an adult might be hired to towel sweat droplets off an NBA court. I am largely ill-suited for anything that requires highly specialized knowledge, advance planning, or making good financial decisions. What I mean by all of this is that General Interactive Co.'s Terroir is the closest I'll ever get to owning a vineyard.  The recently released tycoon-style simulation game allows players to pretend that they've accumulated enough extra cash to open their own vineyard, and the game takes them through each step of becoming a winemaker, from selecting and harvesting each grape variety (""from the hardy Cabernet Sauvignon to the fragile Pinot Noir"") to bottling and selling the final product. Terroir has four winemaking processes—crushing, fermentation, processing and aging—and according to its developers, ""you'll have to learn and master each one.""   ""I quickly realized there wasn't a winemaking tycoon video game that was popularly known or in the mainstream,"" General Interactive creative director Mark Fillion told Venturebeat. ""I knew right away that's what I wanted to do—I wanted to make a video game that put players in charge of their own vineyard.""  According to several reviewers, running a vineyard is stupid hard, mostly because the game simulates the unpredictable weather patterns of France's Bordeaux region. ""One year might yield no rain whatsoever, while another might see no sun, meaning there's absolutely nothing you can do to keep your vines at a decent level of ripeness,"" one wrote, adding that one could be ""completely bankrupt"" within three gameplay years, all because the weather didn't cooperate. (Weirdly enough, this has made me feel both sympathetic for and impressed by even the worst wines I've grabbed from a grocery store shelf).  Any armchair vintner-and-viticulturist will be required to learn  a lot about wine, from fermentation to how to best process the grapes to take advantage of a particular varietal. If you figure those things out, your virtual vineyard could progress through 100 years of gameplay. That kind of attention to detail could be why, according to Fillion, some real-life oenology courses have inquired about using it as a teaching tool.   Now if only someone would develop a sweat-mopping simulator, I'd be set. ",4.0
65716,'Free Willy' Star Jason James Richter Arrested and Charged with Domestic Violence,"The actor who played a troubled kid in ""Free Willy"" has found himself in real trouble as an adult ... we've learned he was arrested for domestic violence. Law enforcement sources tell us former child actor Jason James Richter was arrested Monday night in the San Fernando Valley for misdemeanor domestic violence. He spent two nights in jail before being released Wednesday. Richter's people tell us he had an argument with his girlfriend at around 7 PM at their home. Law enforcement sources say he asked her about a coworker and whether they were having an affair. Things escalated and Richter left, but returned a short time later. The girlfriend told police she retreated to the bedroom and locked the door. We're told Richter broke the door down to get in. She told cops he pulled her into the living room. Four hours later the girlfriend showed up at the police station and filed a report, claiming domestic violence. Richter's people tell us the girlfriend told cops he grabbed her wrists, but we're told cops did not see any visible marks. Authorities tell TMZ the GF claimed he ""grabbed her."" Richter's people tell us he denies the argument ever became physical. Richter starred as Jesse in 1993's ""Free Willy"" and its sequel ""Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home"" -- in which he played an orphan who befriends an orca at a water park, and eventually sets him free into the wild. The first flick also became attached to one of Michael Jackson's hit songs from the '90s, ""Will You Be There.""

65753,"We Talked to the 'Ghost in the Shell' Director About Weed, Whitewashing, and Cyberpunk"," The first thing you notice when you talk to Rupert Sanders is his voice. The director of  Ghost in the Shell, the new live-action sci-fi action film based on the 1995 anime cyberpunk classic, has a methodical cadence. His tone rarely changes. You can hear when he gets frustrated—his speech speeds up and his timbre rises—but then the tone reappears just as quickly, as if nothing has happened.  The  Ghost in the Shell anime and manga source material has had a major influence on science fiction and Hollywood over the last two decades (James Cameron and  The Matrix creators The Wachowskis are reportedly devoted fans). Yet despite the seemingly obviously appeal, ""it was a fight to get [ Ghost in the Shell] made,"" Sanders says, with a slight sigh. ""It wasn't a walk in the park.""  He isn't just talking about securing the necessary funding ($100-plus million) or finding the right cast. Allegations of whitewashing dogged the film from the start; some fans derided the casting of Scarlett Johansson, who plays 'The Major', a cyborg who leads a counter-cyber intelligence task force. But Sanders, who became a fan after first seeing  Ghost in the Shell in college decades ago, believes his film reflects the global reach that any remake of such an iconic film like  GITS hopes to achieve and, quite frankly, deserves.   He doesn't say the controversies were silly, but he does acknowledge, ""I did three weeks of press in Paris, Korea, and Japan, there wasn't one question about this so-called controversy. The controversy only seems to be coming from America.""  He continues, ""We all are liberal minded people, but we didn't feel this was a controversy without people seeing the film and knowing the story. It was a moot point."" Motherboard spoke with Sanders to discuss the thought-process behind his decision to direct the remake, as well as the role that technology plays in this new  Ghost in the Shell universe.   When was your first encounter with   Ghost in the Shell ? I first saw it when I was at art college. I saw it on VHS a couple of years after it was released. And the world really blew my mind. I had never seen animation aimed at an adult audience. It was this beautiful futuristic world that I had never really seen anywhere: Crazy characters, sexualized, philosophized. It haunted me, and that was my initiation.   Were you a fan of anime at that time? No, not really. I knew very little, and then I dug in deeper, and started watching other stuff. And the beauty of anime for the adult mind is the imagination of the anime creator is beyond limits. They aren't really restricted by what is achievable. If you can imagine it, you can draw it. Their work can be vast and yet kind of really abstract. You don't have to make it for a large audience. It is relatively less expensive to make something animated than it is to make it for real. So they can deal with subjects and philosophical fanatics that are a lot less geared to a mainstream audience.   Whereas what we do, if you can imagine it, it is still pretty hard to pull off for a price.    As you began to assemble the cast, were they also familiar with   GITS ? It varied. I worked with a lot of the concept artists, a lot of the people who helped me design and intellectualize the film were very familiar with the original, which is why they were all desperate to work on the project. Some of the cast knew it, others didn't, but they all had a similar feeling to when I first saw it. Their first response [was]: 'wow this is amazing', their second: 'how are we going to do this?'   That second question must have already been on your mind even before you signed on to direct. Very much so. A lot of people who work around me told me not to do it: 'You're crazy.' I really felt once I started thinking, you get blinkered by your own imagination, and once I thought of the prospect of doing it, it was hard to let it go. It haunted me for the second time.   You've said that you didn't want to do a shot-for-shot remake, so was that a freeing decision in terms of how you wanted to put your own mark on this universe? Yeah, I think I wasn't so worried about the directorial freedom. Ultimately I could have just used the title, but that wasn't why I signed on. I wanted to be part of the legacy of  Ghost in the Shell. Why make a  Ghost in the Shell movie if it is not  Ghost in the Shell? That was my pitch to Steven Spielberg [who had acquired the rights to a live-action adaptation]. If I wanted to make something that was closer in spirit to the anime, and there were things as a fan of the original that I felt had to be in there, that I really needed to cinematize and to translate much closer to the original. The water fight, exploding geisha heads, Major on the tank, Major jumping off the roof.  Those things are iconic, and if they weren't in there, people would be upset, myself included. We are in this  Ghost in the Shell world. Everything is cables. And early on, people were like, 'Why are there cables in everything?' Well, it is  Ghost in the Shell, and if there were no cables, it wouldn't be  Ghost in the Shell, so I am going to defer to the style of  Ghost in the Shell and put cables in everything.   I had interviewed Finn Jones, who discussed taking on projects like   Iron Fist  and   Game of Thrones with such a die-hard fan base, and how he enjoyed that challenge. Same for you? I think that was a consideration. Ultimately, though, I felt it was better that a fan made it. You can't make anything artistic if you are terrified of the response. You have to take that leap, and I guess you have to work in isolation.  [GITS] was a hard project to pull off. People weren't jumping up and down desperate to make  Ghost in the Shell. It's kind of a bleak title. You watch the anime as a commercial venture, that's a hard thing to say 'I get it. We're going to make it.' It was a fight to get it made. It wasn't a walk in the park. As a fan of the material, all I'd be able to do was channel the spirit of  Ghost in the Shell and the essence of that property, but I knew that I was going to have to make changes to the story and the plot. The original is led by philosophy and thematic introspection, and the plot is kind of at the bottom, and I knew I had to invert that. It is a very complicated world, and I needed to lure people in with a plot that had familiarity, and then you can start to play with those themes of dualism and reflection of technology and all of those things that are  Ghost in the Shell. But you can't lead with that, or no one will come to the cinema.  [Mamoru] Oshii [director of the original anime film] was great early on. He said just be liberated, and don't just make something because you feel you have to stay exactly in our world. Be inspired by it, and make your own version. That was very encouraging.  All films of this scale are hard to get made because it is a huge investment. You put the production fee, and then the marketing fee, and it's a big investment. I think my passion for the project is what kept is alive. There were a few times when it could have died. And then getting Scarlett was very key to getting this film made. Without her, we wouldn't have made this film.   Was it more interesting to conceptualize and direct this film because some of the technologies first envisioned in the original   Ghost  world have come closer to reality? What is crazy about [Masamune] Shirow's work [who created the original manga comic] is that he was talking about interconnected computers, and the vast and infinite network when universities in America hadn't even said hello to each other. It was a time when he was predicting things that were not actually there yet. Some of those ideas were so abstract, and now, we are all within an infinite network. It becomes more relative.   Since this tech isn't so far-fetched, did that alter how you tweaked   Ghost in the Shell to discuss issues that are current to our climate? Well, I think  Ghost shows technology is omnipresent. What interests me is the sovereignty of data and the trust we put in our data storage. We put so much trust in our iPhone. Someone who controls my iPhone knows everything about me. Where I take my Uber, what I buy, where I shop, where I sleep, who I talk to or text. That's frightening as it is, but then put that as a cerebral implant, and have your memories, your dreams, your fears accessible, it becomes more heightened, and that was one of the things that really interested me as far as that technology, as far as that predictive technology goes.  Should our dreams, our fears, our anxieties be accessible to the government? Or government agencies? These are frightening dilemmas, and a lot of the dilemmas in this film that we face are about technology. That whole Stuxnet documentary [Zero Days] was terrifying, the idea of a wanton virus that can be just let out to destroy certain systems is terrifying. The protection of our data is terrifying. We are already developing codes and systems for AI that are dealing with life and death situations. I was talking to someone about self-driving cars, and how software is being written that if a car with one driver is on an unavoidable head on collision with five passengers, the car with only one driver will sacrifice its driver to save five others. There is something also about age—a younger driver will be spared over an older driver. I'm sure things will start to bleed in, who has the most expensive car, who is of a greater value to society. These are the things that AI will be deciding in the split second before two cars prang [hit] each other on the 405 freeway. We are not making a film just about technology, but these are themes that  Ghost in the Shell opens up in a world. More of these concepts can be discussed.   Did making this film, then, improve or dampen your view of technology? Humans have to create machines that far more intelligent than them with human characteristics so that we won't get too frightened.  Her did a great job of exploding our perception of what robots are capable of, and I love the idea of technology and AI systems being powerful and omnipresent enough to decide our fate, and whether they need us. If we are slowly destroying the branch of the earth that we are sitting on is quite a truthful prospect, and maybe they should get rid of us. If we are undermining the infrastructure they are relying on at such a rate as we are, then maybe they've got a point.   When the trailers and clips of the film first began to drop, did you hope people would also begin to view the film's casting on its merits? No, not really. I think the controversy to me is…look, I obviously have put a lot of thought into this. I don't think there is any smokescreen that because you cast Scarlett Johansson in a role in a Japanese anime that is now not a Japanese anime but is an international film. I think Oshii said it best—she is a cyborg shell and she has no race, and he said Scarlett is the best person in the world to play Major. That was reassuring. She is not playing a Japanese person, she is playing a machine in a shell created by an American multinational corporation, in this case.   It also seems like Scarlett has taken on more sci-fi projects than any other actor working these days. She embodies this world. She is so physical, and she has this indie spirit. There aren't many actresses who have the CV to play that complex a character. The world cast Scarlett really. That's who people want to see in this kind of film.   You mentioned the film might have died at several points. Would this whitewashing controversy have contributed to that? No. People weren't calling up [Martin] Scorsese when he was making  The Departed and said 'Why aren't you using Asian actors?' He took an Asian film, and made an American and international film out of it. We have an incredibly diverse cast. We have cast members from Syria, from Zimbabwe, from Fuji, Australia, Denmark, from England, from America.  I think when people see the film, it is ultimately an international and global film starring a global lead. You need Scarlett Johansson if you are opening a film in Russia as well as in Tokyo.    Do you see the world of   Ghost in the Shell as our future? It's more a parallel universe. It's a timeless world. But the technologies are there to illustrate some of the themes about the world, rather than say to everyone, 'This is what the world will be in 50 years.' That is not what our film is about. Our film is an abstract version of a future in which humanity is all but consumed by technology.  We didn't want to make a world that was that realistic, and in a way, science fiction takes you to worlds you don't really want to know where you are. That's the beauty of sci-fi. From afar, you can magnify some of those more human stories.    Where does the film then fall on the spectrum of utopia and dystopia? For me, there is a real color and beauty to the world. It's not a dystopian wasteland. It's a functional, colorful bright kind of future that is kind of thrilling. Some of the film does take place in the dark abandoned corners of the city that are unnecessary nowadays, the industrial part of the city where industry has ceased, but it is certainly more colorful and brighter than most sci-fi films.    As a fan of the original   Ghost in the Shell , did you expect to ever remake it? [Laughing] No. I was smoking way too much weed and raving too much to even want to know if I had a job at the end of it. I was just absorbing art and culture that you turn into a career ultimately. Too many people don't live enough to have experiences to draw from. I didn't start making films until I was 27—I had a good 10 years of indulgence and absorption of art and culture and the world and that's what I try to put into my work.

66538,"After surrendering CSeries, Bombardier pushes regional plane revival","MONTREAL (Reuters) - As Bombardier (BBDb.TO) surrenders hopes of securing a top spot in commercial aviation with the sale of its money-losing CSeries jet program to Airbus (AIR.PA), the Canadian company is now drawing up plans to breathe new life into its older regional planes.  Bombardier is shoring up its loss-making regional jets and turboprops with a mixture of hard-sell, cost-cutting and outsourcing. It is also growing its line of business jets after a cash squeeze and production delays forced it to cede a majority stake in its high-tech CSeries which aims to break into the market for mainline jets dominated by Airbus and Boeing.   The company will now “sharpen the focus” on its remaining commercial planes, with Bombardier Commercial Aircraft President Fred Cromer recently expanding the leadership team for the division which has combined orders in hand for just for over 100 planes, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.  Bombardier also plans to showcase its CRJ regional jets, which recently had a cabin upgrade with more overhead bin space to appeal to business travelers, at the industry’s flagship Farnborough Air Show in July, an event it previously used to market the CSeries, two sources familiar with the company’s thinking said.   The company’s regional jet initiative won a boost from  Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), which on Wednesday announced orders for 20 CRJ 900s with the new interiors, valued at around $961 million by list prices, as it and other U.S. carriers replace aging 50 and 70-seat planes with new regional jets.   According to the memo and sources familiar with the situation, the company is now moving forward with a plan to lower its regional Q400 turboprop’s costs by outsourcing its wings and cockpit from Toronto to lower cost countries, although specific locations were not named.   In 2016, Bombardier expected to move the cockpit to China and the wings to Mexico with the union’s agreement, but Bombardier failed to carry it out because the program’s volumes were previously too low, both sources said.  Bombardier said in the memo it also aims to reap more profits by promoting aftermarket services for its over 2,000 regional planes already in the air, which is part of a broader strategy the company is using for its business jets.   In a sign that Bombardier will push harder on servicing existing planes, the company plans to hire a separate executive to head customer service for its regional planes, a position currently filled by the same person who heads the Q400 program, the second source said.  All of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Bombardier’s private strategies.  For Bombardier, the challenge is to erase losses and generating $1.5 billion in revenues by 2020. But the turnaround strategy faces headwinds.  Bombardier’s efforts to revive regional plane sales, which it sees as a $240 billion market between 2017 and 2036, come as some forecasters are expecting limited near-term sector growth.  “Demand for regional aircraft will remain weak relative to large commercial aircraft,” said Moody’s in a recent note. It predicted that regional aircraft deliveries, including the CSeries, would grow by over 4 percent in 12-to-18 months, compared with an 8-to-10 percent rise in larger aircraft. The 110-130-seat CSeries overlap regional and mainline passenger jet markets.  Bombardier is also tasked with winning orders for its regional Q400 turboprop, which sources say the company considered selling. The plane holds barely a quarter of a market that is dominated by ATR, a prop-making joint venture between Airbus and Italian group Leonardo.   Such a disparity in sales can turn into a nightmare for the losing planemaker as its adversary benefits from higher volumes to bring down unit costs, which in turn help it sell more.  Bombardier’s Cromer has appointed an executive to pursue its plan to outsource the Q400’s cockpit and wings from Toronto, which would make the prop more competitive with lower-cost ATR, the memo said.   “We’ve got a backlog now so that allows us to evaluate all the outsourcing possibilities,” the source said.  The Q400 will continue to be produced at a plant in Canada’s largest city Toronto, which was recently sold by Bombardier but remains under lease for 3 to 5 years, until a new site can be located.  Bombardier said in a statement that is “constantly looking at strategic options for all our businesses.”  The company will also step up marketing campaigns in India and Africa, aiming to persuade airlines to pick the longer-range Q400s to connect cities with secondary destinations which either do not have service or are served by jets that have higher operating costs.   India has emerged as a fast-growing market for turboprops, benefiting both ATR and Bombardier, which won its largest single order to date for the planes last year from Indian low cost carrier SpiceJet.  Promoting the Q400 for underserved markets in Africa also helped win a recent order from Ethiopian Airlines..  But the African market also has risks, with Angola’s president recently telling Euronews that a domestic airline startup was a “fictitious company,” casting doubt on its order of 6 Q400s.

71327,'Systemic failure' of U.N. ahead of Myanmar military crackdown: review,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - There was a “systemic failure” of the United Nations in dealing with the situation in Myanmar ahead of a deadly 2017 military crackdown because it did not have a unified strategy and lacked Security Council support, according to an internal report.  The crackdown drove more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh. U.N. investigators have said the operation was executed with “genocidal intent” and included mass killings, gang rapes and widespread arson.   Myanmar denies widespread wrongdoing and says the military campaign across hundreds of villages in northern Rakhine was in response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents.  “Without question serious errors were committed and opportunities were lost in the U.N. system following a fragmented strategy rather than a common plan of action,” wrote former Guatemalan foreign minister and U.N. ambassador Gert Rosenthal in a 34-page internal review, seen by Reuters prior to its publication on Monday.   “The overall responsibility was of a collective character; in other words, it truly can be characterized as a systemic failure of the United Nations,” wrote Rosenthal, who was appointed by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres earlier this year to look at U.N. involvement in Myanmar from 2010 to 2018.  He said senior U.N. officials in New York could not agree on whether to take a more robust public approach with Myanmar or pursue quiet diplomacy and that conflicting reports on the situation were also sent to U.N. headquarters from the field.   The United Nations struggled to balance supporting the Myanmar government with development and humanitarian assistance, while also calling out the authorities over accusations of human rights violations, Rosenthal concluded.   “The United Nations system ... has been relatively impotent to effectively work with the authorities of Myanmar to reverse the negative trends in the area of human rights and consolidate the positive trends in other areas,” he said.    “The United Nations’ collective membership, represented by the Security Council, bears part of that responsibility, by not providing enough support to the secretariat when such backing was and continues to be essential,” Rosenthal wrote.   The 15-member Security Council, which visited Myanmar’s Rakhine state last year, has been deadlocked with Myanmar allies China and Russia pitted against western states over how to deal with the situation.  Human Rights Watch said the report was disappointing, given the scale of the Rohingya crisis, for not identifying specific U.N. officials responsible for the failures.  “The report now looks increasingly like a check-the-box exercise by U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, designed to show commitment to accountability when in reality it accomplishes exactly the opposite,” Phil Robertson, the group’s deputy director for Asia, said in a statement.  U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Rosenthal’s report was due to be sent to all 193 U.N. members states.   “Its conclusions and observations have been fully accepted by the Secretary-General, and he will work very closely with the senior leadership to make sure they’re implemented,” he said.

79739,Grab CEO defends global alliance for its customers,"Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has tried to debunk the threat to his company that stems from the alliance of his rivals. Either he's bluffing or he's wrong. In the last year, Uber's rival Lyft formed a global partnership with Chinese company Didi Kuaidi, Southeast Asia's Grab, and India's Ola. Lyft users visiting China could use the Lyft app to hail a car from Didi Kuaidi, and vice versa for Chinese visitors in the US. The same now goes for Grab. In a January interview, Kalanick disputed that the alliance meant anything substantial. ""The anti-Uber alliance is not a corporation or identity, it's an idea. They can have coffee together on Sundays, I guess,"" Kalanick told the Times of India. Grab's CEO Anthony Tan, though, says the alliance is much more than just a brunch club. ""Do we sit down for coffee? We do. We sit down for dinners together all the time,"" Tan joked with Business Insider. ""But do we do business together? We do a lot of business together."" One part has just been working to make the apps integrate with each other. If you're a Lyft user in the US, you can visit China or Singapore and open the Lyft app. But that's just a slice of what the partnership has done, Tan argues. Much of the technology shared between the companies has been how to better track rides and improve the safety of customers, he said. He's also asked advice for things like how to make sure bad drivers are kept off the platform or how ratings should work. There are some shortcomings to the partnership — map data, for instance, isn't easily transferable — but to Tan, the global alliance has been much more than a simple idea. It's a benefit to the customers, he said. ""If you look at the global roaming product, soon a US Lyft customer will have access to the world's largest transportation network of cars and bikes,"" Tan said.",4.5
83613,"In Tragedy, 'Life Is Strange' Finds Freedom for the People Who Need It Most","  Postscript  is Cameron Kunzelman's weekly column about endings, apocalypses, deaths, bosses, and all sorts of other finalities. We have spoilers this week, folks!   Life is Strange is an episodic game about time travel that opens with a vision: A giant tornado moving from sea to land, toward the coastal town of Arcadia Bay. The tiny buildings are miniscule in the face of the impossibly large vortex. It's so big that, when I played it, I assumed that the world was ending. I thought that the storm was a symptom of the annihilation of the entirety of human existence localized into this one particular manifestation. And, in some ways, I still think that's right.  It should go without saying at this point that I'm going to be spoiling  Life is Strange. I'd suggest going and playing the game in its entirety; it's a favorite, for me, now that I'm on the other side of it.    Life is Strange is five episodes of time hopping. Our protagonist, or at least our point-of-view character, is Max, a Polaroid-snapping teen who attends the prestigious arts high school Blackwell Academy. The game is about living her life: You meet her friends, hate on her enemies, and solve mysteries. Taking cues from the first season of  Twin Peaks and the film  Brick,  Life is Strange puts us right in the middle of several mysteries. Rachel Amber has gone missing. What happened to her? Why is the school security guard so incredibly creepy? Who is drugging women at parties?   Max is only able to delve into these mysteries because of Chloe. The story is muddy, and if you've played through the game you know it, but Max and Chloe have a complicated relationship. They were childhood friends. Max moved away from Arcadia Bay at the same time that Chloe's father died, and they didn't speak to one another for years.  Life is Strange puts them back together again after Max uses her time power to prevent Chloe from being shot, and their relationship after that moment animates the game's plot using the joy and tension of their reuniting. There is this  energy between the two of them, and it plays out in a hundred different micro scenes, splicing off into the general feeling of the game like a Tesla experiment.   They solve the mysteries, or they at least run them all down to their final leads. Arcadia Bay hides a sinister set of secrets. The richest family in the town protects and promotes their young, violent, Patrick Bateman-esque son. The police are all paid off. The security guard who claims he wants to protect students is an abusive stepdad who will, when pushed, hits his stepdaughter. Rachel Amber, the missing girl, didn't just disappear. She was killed and buried in plastic in the loose dirt of a junkyard. And there's a dark room,  the Dark Room, where an authority figure takes drugged high school girls and photographs them for his collection. In monologue, he tells us about how he wants to capture the moment where innocence transitions into something else. It makes the skin crawl.  Max uses time travel to figure it all out. You dip into the future to find information, and you go into the past to act on it at the right time. You see an effect, and you do some trial-and-error to alter or eliminate the cause. But most of these horrible things are unerring. The tragedy of time travel is not knowing what will happen, but realizing what people are capable of.  Life is Strange gives us many instances of people at their worst, and we're supposed to rewind the world to make things better. That doesn't make me forget what their worst  was, though.  At the end of the game, at the end of all things in Arcadia Bay, you have a choice. Max can travel back in time before she met Chloe again. By letting Chloe die and never using her time powers, Max can reset the game, in a way, and this storm will never appear. We're told that it is all the time manipulation that has lured this apocalyptic event to this sleepy coastal town. Solving the mysteries and delving into the deepest, darkest secrets has earned the ire of some inhuman, natural force. Never going there, staying on the surface of things, will keep this storm from coming.   Or, on the other hand, Max can accept what's happening in front of her. She can watch as the storm crests over the shoreline of Arcadia Bay. It pushes over the storm wall, reaches the first rows of shops, and sucks buildings up into its massive whorl. You can watch Arcadia Bay disintegrate. Chloe's mother, stuck in the diner she works in, will die in this. So will Warren, the boy crushing on Max. So will Frank, the drug dealer who loved Rachel Amber. All of these stories, eliminated. But Chloe lives.  The game pulls a strange move during this more-bleak ending. All of these people die, or their lives are destroyed, and we're shown a new day. A family of deer, a new family, stand amidst the ruins of Arcadia Bay. They're picking through the wreckage. The sun shines down on it all. Birds fly over the scene, unhindered, the catastrophe sprawled out beneath them in a tableau of destruction.   Max and Chloe drive through in a battered pickup. They stop, and Chloe touches Max's shoulder. Neither speaks. They drive out, beyond the screen, beyond our vision.  Patricia Hernandez has argued that this limited, shorter ending after the storm might be a punishment for our selfish choice. Max chooses Chloe and damns everyone else. But I think it's more poignant, or more utopian, than that. The catastrophic choice frees these two. There are no more stepdads, no more boyfriend-wannabees, no more investment possibilities in Arcadia Bay. This is a horizon line, and Max and Chloe are able to cross it together on into something else beyond us. The rest of the people in the game are written out of the story by a player choice, and so is the player. By choosing Chloe, we're granting them freedom, and that's freedom from us as well.

Nevertheless, for the third time in six years, the United States government is expected to urge members of a global animal protection pact to act on the melting Arctic and classify polar bears among the world's most endangered species. This would place them alongside the red panda and African bush elephant as ""threatened with extinction."" Doing so would outlaw the international sale of bear hides, and the Canadian pushback turns on this fact. Related: Polar Bears Are Now Eating Dolphins in the Arctic Washington also tried, and failed, to change the bears' classification in 2010 and 2013, with the effort being voted down both times. But with the waning of Arctic sea ice, pressure is mounting, and this effort might prove successful. The question will come to a vote in September, and Canada has run a lobbying campaign in the lead-up, trying to sway Washington away from the plan. Canadian officials have met with American officials in Congress and the Bureau of Indian Affairs in recent months. If America does succeed in re-classifying the polar bears, it will not technically ban Canada's polar bear hunts, but will forbid the international sale of the bear's fur. ""We are not denying climate change, because we are at the forefront of it, but at the same time, these predictions that in 100 years, the polar bear will be extinct, that is very far fetched."" Both Canada's government, and its Inuit communities who hunt the bear, say going after hunting is unnecessary and may threaten the Arctic's indigenous peoples. ""International trade is not a threat to polar bears, and the species does not meet the biological criteria [small and shrinking population] for an Appendix I listing at the current time,"" reads a statement posted to the Environment and Climate Change Canada website. Polar bears are currently listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which means the animal is at-risk, but may still be hunted and traded under some conditions. Appendix I covers species that may be at risk for outright extinction — trading animals found on that list is outright forbidden. In the 1960s and 1970s, unregulated commercial and sports hunting led to a sharp drop in the polar bear population. But with tight regulations on hunting, the population has recovered to around 26,000 animals in 19 distinct groups across Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia and the United States, according to IUCN most recent estimates.Sixty percent of all polar bears are found in Canada, and the IUCN states that the annual hunt of 700 to 800 bear across the USA, Canada and Greenland is ""thought to be sustainable in most subpopulations."" But for polar bears, the existential threat comes not from hunting, but from climate change. ""The decline of sea ice habitat due to changing climate is the primary threat to polar bears,"" states the US Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) draft conservation plan. ""Short of action that effectively addresses the primary cause of diminishing sea ice, it is unlikely that polar bears will be recovered."" Canada's northern population recognizes that threat. ""We are not denying climate change, because we are at the forefront of it,"" Adamie Delisle-Alaku told VICE News from Washington. ""But at the same time, these predictions that in 100 years, the polar bear will be extinct, that is very far fetched."" Delisle-Alaku is the vice-president of renewable resources at Nunavik's Makivik Corporation, which represents the Inuit in Quebec. But scientists and green groups worry that changes in the bears' habitat may soon push them to the brink. In the Arctic, sea ice waxes and wanes with with seasons but in the last decades rising temperatures have caused lower ice levels, according to researchers with the National Snow and Ice Data Center. NSIDC director Mark Serreze told VICE News in January that Arctic summers will be ice free within a century, and possibly within 20 years. Related: Here's Why Polar Bears' Summer Just Got a Bit Worse This bodes ill for the bear who use Arctic sea ice to hunt seal in the summer. ""Although well adapted to seasonal ice melt, polar bears appear susceptible to deleterious declines in body condition during the lengthening period of summer food deprivation,"" states a study on the effects of melting sea ice published in the journal Science last summer. The northern hunt isn't just about selling the bears' fur, however. For many in the north, the hunt is about food. According to Inuit leaders, polar bear hunts are important to the financial and food security of indigenous traditional communities in a part of Canada where the high cost of living makes hunger and poverty commonplace. In Nunavut, for instance, a 5.5-pound bag of flour cost $13.60 CAD compared to the Canada-wide average of $5.03 CAD, according to the Nunavut Bureau of Statistics. Food and energy costs in the north are often double those in the rest of Canada. Justin Trudeau's Liberal government has pledged an additional $40 million to the $60-million Nutrition North program, which subsidized food costs. ""Polar bear hunting is one source of nutrition…and it's also an opportunity to generate a little bit of income,"" said Delisle-Alaku. However, he also noted that the sale of polar bear fur, mostly to China, has been in a long, slow decline as the bears have become emblematic of the threat of climate change. ""It's part of their lives and even if it moves from Appendix II to Appendix I, we're still going to hunt polar bear for food, but it'd be a great loss to the harvesters and us Inuit,"" James Eetoolook, vice-president of Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., which manages Inuit land claims in the territory told VICE News. ""When it comes to hunting, it's in the Inuit's blood."" Follow Jake Bleiberg on Twitter: @JZBleiberg",2.5
91109,U.N. chief calls for independent probe into Gulf tanker attacks,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Friday for an independent investigation to establish the facts and who was responsible for attacks on two oil tankers this week in the Gulf of Oman.  The United States blamed Iran for the attacks on Thursday, a charge Tehran rejected. Amid the rising tensions, Guterres said he was available to mediate if the parties agreed, however he added that “at the present moment we don’t see a mechanism of dialogue possible to be in place.”   Tehran and Washington have both said they have no interest in starting a war, but this has done little to assuage concerns that the two arch foes could stumble into a conflict. Guterres said the world cannot afford a major confrontation in the Gulf.   “It’s very important to know the truth and it’s very important that responsibilities are clarified. Obviously that can only be done if there is an independent entity that verifies those facts,” he told reporters, adding that he believed only the Security Council could order a U.N. investigation.  U.N. political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo met with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Friday on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Council meeting in Kyrgyzstan, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. He added that Guterres and his staff had been in contact with many of the countries concerned to tell them of the need to avoid any escalation.  Guterres, who condemned the attacks on the tankers, was speaking on Friday alongside Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit after the pair met.   Gheit told reporters that he did not believe an Arab country was “trying to obstruct naval lanes or to shoot itself in the foot by acting the way we have seen in the Gulf of Oman or in the Hormuz Strait.”  “My call to our Iranian brothers - be careful and reverse course because you’re pushing everybody toward a confrontation that no-one would be safe if it happens,” he told reporters.

94153,Contemporary Arab Cinema Series Looks Past Headlines to Realities of the Region,"Opening Saturday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, ANA features a selection of movies reflecting the political and social realities of the Arab world, from Palestine to Tunisia. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Shattering Prejudices. Exposing hard truths. Provoking dialogues. Stirring debates. Films produced by the new generation of Arab filmmakers reveal what the mainstream media and pop culture do not: a multilayered society in flux, desperately seeking liberation. Programmer Lina Matta has roamed the region, and the world’s film festivals, in search of the most promising directors of the region. We spoke to her about the seventh edition of the ANA Contemporary Arab Cinema series, premiering at the Brooklyn Academy of Music this fall.     *     *     * Hyperallergic: What is your selection process for the movies for this series?  Lina Matta: When I first started the series seven years ago, I would attend the three main regional film festivals focused on movies from the Arab world. These festivals have since shut down; the Dubai International Film Festival is closing this year after a fourteen-year course. I also keep an eye on the international festivals like TIFF, Cannes, Berlin, and Sundance. HA: Is this series targeted to Western audiences, Arab audiences or both? Why? LM: The series is primarily targeted to Western audiences. Audiences walk away feeling that they’ve uncovered an Arab world they’ve never seen depicted in the news or on television. They discover that Arabs’ daily lives, fears, anxieties, and landscapes are just like theirs. I also hope that Arabs attend, to see films about other Arab countries. Our own stereotypes and ignorance of our neighbors are also a major issue in the region.  HA: How does Arabic cinema reveal alternative narratives from the region? How are these narratives received in the region, and abroad?  LM: The idea of this series is to have our people, our master story-tellers, tell our stories. Some of the films have been hugely popular in their homeland, like Nadine Labaki’s Where Do We Go Now, Sophie Boutros’ Mahbas; others, like Ziad Doueiri’s The Insult, Hany Abu Assad’s Omar, Jehane Noujaim’s The Square,  Naji Abu Nowar’s Theeb and Abdulrahmane Sissako’s Timbuktu were nominated for an Oscar. Very few have gotten international distribution because they are mostly indie films. HA: With the recent social upheavals, many activists have turned to art to express dissent. Do these movies reflect these social movements?  LM: Definitely. Some of these films are very brave, and attack the ills of their society head on and unapologetically. In this year’s selection, the movies Investigating Paradise, The Journey, Zagros, The Blessed, and Beauty and the Dogs tackle warped interpretations of Islam, suicide bombers, honor killings, and being let down by an ideological revolution or a system. HA: Please highlight the key issues and themes of this year’s selection. Why are these questions important today?  LM: The films from North Africa tend to indict their regimes post-civil war or post-Arab spring. They challenge bureaucracies and the lack of fundamental changes in their society.  While they may first seem like films about family dynamics, Lucien Bourjeili’s Heaven Without People and Sofia Djama’s The Blessed also address politics, religion, and living in the aftermath of civil war. Investigating Paradise [Merzak Allouache] and The Journey [Mohamed al Daradji] deal with the ways in which Islam, if interpreted in a literal, close-minded way, can lead to very dangerous consequences. Kaouther Ben Hania and Khaled Barsaoui’s Beauty and the Dogs, a story about a Tunisian girl getting raped, works as an indictment on bureaucracy and a system gone wrong. Claire Belhassine’s The Man Behind the Microphone is about family secrets, but it’s also about a particular era in Tunisia’s modern history. Khaled Diab’s Induced Labour, one of the few comedies in the series, is about the lengths people will go for a better life; Sherif Nakhla’s Les Petits Chats is about a period in which Egypt was embracing the West and a cover band that rocked the hottest nightclubs of the Arab world for twenty-eight years. Philippe Aractingi’s Listen is a modern love story that urges us to “listen” amidst the religious, social, and day-to-day cacophony of Lebanon. Muayad Alayan’s The Reports of Sarah and Saleem is the story of an affair that unfolds in Jerusalem, with its unique political landscape. Sahim Omar Kalifa’s Zagros also tackles trust within a relationship set against a backdrop of old traditions of honor killings. HA: There is a prominence of female Arabic directors, including Palestinian Anne-Marie Jacir, to whom BAM is dedicating an entire program in October, and who is attending the premiere of her feature Wajib.  LM: Arabic cinema is young; it is only about twenty years old. There is no glass ceiling for women to break. They got into the field at the same time that men did. Women do not tackle certain topics, per se, in as much as they may come to it with a different perspective. HA: What message are you hoping to spread with this series? Do you believe that art can provoke social change? LM: Once we see the “other,” we understand that they are not that different from us. Our issues are universal, the ways in which we deal with them may differ because of tradition and circumstance. This is an important message at this time when differences are emphasized and fear is spread and used as a weapon of control. I really hope that these movies can affect those who come in to see them and inspire them to read the news with a level of empathy they may not have had before. The ANA 2018 will run from September 29–October 4 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Brooklyn, NY.",3.0
96348,The marketing genius behind Snap’s new Spectacles,"One week ago, I had virtually zero interest in owning a pair of Snap Spectacles, the company’s new video-recording sunglasses. On Saturday, I contemplated the six-hour drive from San Francisco to LA to buy a pair out of a vending machine. What a difference a week can make. The rollout of Spectacles has been, well, a spectacle. Everywhere Snap drops a Snapbot, the big yellow vending machines that serve as temporary storefronts for the glasses, crowds line up, dozens of people deep, and spend their hours waiting in line posting and tweeting about how excited they are to get their hands on some Spectacles. It’s been a touch of marketing genius. Snap isn’t going to make much money selling smart glasses one vending machine-full at a time. But that’s not the point. Instead, what the company has done is create the kind of buzz and excitement around a product — and thus the Snap brand, which is prepping for an IPO — that we haven’t seen in a long, long time. How, exactly, did that happen? The reality is that Spectacles aren’t going to be big business for Snap, at least not anytime soon. The company wouldn’t sell them out of vending machines if it was trying to make money here. But Spectacles are giving Snap a new wave of momentum just before it plans to IPO — and the idea that it could sell a lot of glasses has been planted in everyone’s mind. And that feeling isn’t ephemeral. This article originally appeared on Recode.net.",2.5
98200,"Indian journalists say they intimidated, ostracized if they criticize Modi and the BJP","NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and by some measures the biggest and most diverse media industry in the world. But journalists here say they are increasingly facing intimidation aimed at stopping them from running stories critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his administration.  At least three senior editors have left their jobs at various influential media outlets in the past six months after publishing reports that angered the government or supporters of Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), according to colleagues.   Some reporters, as well as television anchors, have told Reuters they have been threatened with physical harm, abused on social media and ostracized by Modi’s administration.  In its annual World Press Freedom Index released on Wednesday, the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders said that India was now 138th-ranked in the world out of 180 countries measured, down two positions since 2017 and lower than countries like Zimbabwe, Afghanistan and Myanmar. When the index was started in 2002, India was ranked 80th out of 139 countries surveyed.  Reporters Without Borders said that “with Hindu nationalists trying to purge all manifestations of ‘anti-national’ thought from the national debate, self-censorship is growing in the mainstream media and journalists are increasingly the targets of online smear campaigns by the most radical nationalists, who vilify them and even threaten physical reprisals.”  The group said that “hate speech targeting journalists is shared and amplified on social networks, often by troll armies.”      Spokesmen for the government declined comment on the accusations by journalists. They did not immediately respond to  the Reporters Without Borders report.  However, not all Indian journalists believe there is a problem. Swapan Dasgupta, a member of parliament and a political columnist who supports Modi, said the press freedom ranking was “quite inexplicable”.  “I don’t believe there has been any shrinkage in the freedom of the media in the past few years,” he said in an e-mail.        G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, a spokesman for the ruling BJP, said  allegations of media intimidation were far from the truth.  “On the contrary, the BJP has been a victim of the viciousness of large sections of the media that flourished under the patronage of the Congress, left and other opposition parties,” he told Reuters in e-mailed comments. “The unabashed bias of these media against the BJP has not dented our party’s political growth.”  Some journalists in India say they believe media freedoms are now under even more threat in the run-up to an election due next year. There have been some signs of increasing opposition to Modi’s economic policies and to the BJP’s muscular Hindu nationalism.    “India is going through an aggressive variant of McCarthyism against the media,” said Prannoy Roy, co-founder of NDTV, India’s first private news channel.  NDTV, which some BJP leaders have called the least friendly of India’s television channels, is being investigated for fraud by federal police. The company has called it a witch-hunt.  The government declined to respond to Roy’s comments.  Sagarika Ghose, a columnist with the Times of India newspaper, said she is viciously trolled for any criticism of  the administration.  “The minute I write something, I get droves of hate mail,” Ghose said. “I have had death threats and gang rape threats on social media and also through letters sent to my home. They know where I live.”  Ravish Kumar, a news anchor who has been scathing about the government in his program for NDTV’s Hindi-language channel, said he has been constantly harassed and threatened by pro-government activists.  “This is very organized,” he told Reuters. “They follow me. When I go out to report, a crowd gathers in 10 minutes.”  Reporters Without Borders counted instances of Indian journalists being killed because of what they write.  “At least three of the journalists murdered in 2017 were targeted in connection with their work,” it said.  Among them was editor and publisher Gauri Lankesh, a vocal advocate of secularism and critic of right-wing political ideology. A member of a hardline Hindu group has been arrested for the murder of Lankesh, who was gunned down outside her home..  Journalists say that media proprietors, who often have multiple kinds of businesses, are risk averse and can be leaned on by the government.  “Media proprietors are notorious for reading the tea leaves, they get a clear sense of the tolerance level of politicians in power,” said Siddharth Varadarajan, who runs a not-for-profit online news portal called The Wire. “Government ministers have coined this word, presstitute, to describe journalists who are unfriendly to them or who don’t do their bidding,” he said.  Bobby Ghosh, the editor of the Hindustan Times, one of India’s premier broadsheets, quit last September shortly after Modi met the owner of the newspaper. At least two senior journalists familiar with the situation said they were told that Modi was unhappy with Ghosh’s editorial policies.  The journalists told Reuters that Ghosh fell out of favor with the government after he launched a webpage called the Hate Tracker, a database of violent crimes based on religion, race  ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation.  The database was taken down in October.  Ghosh declined to specify why he quit the Hindustan Times.  The prime minister’s office and the newspaper declined requests for comment on the matter.  A letter published at the time from the government’s chief spokesman Frank Noronha said Modi had met the Hindustan Times chairwoman Shobhana Bhartia when she invited the prime minister to attend a conference organized by the newspaper.   “Other related assumptions and insinuations...are baseless and denied,” Noronha said. “The government is committed to the freedom of the press.”  Restrictions on reporting are likely to intensify heading into the election, said Harish Khare, who resigned as editor-in-chief of the widely read Tribune newspaper last month.   “It (the government) will use every resource in its command to pressurize, manipulate, misguide media or any other voice which seeks to be independent of the government,” said Khare, who was for some time the prime minister’s press secretary in the Congress Party government that lost power to Modi and the BJP in 2014.   He told Reuters his relations with the Tribune’s controlling trust nosedived after the newspaper published a story exposing flaws in Aadhar, the government’s national identity card project.  The newspaper’s trust rejected his accusations. “To the contrary, the Tribune Trust gave an unprecedented award of  50,000 rupees ($765) to the correspondent (who wrote the story) in recognition of the work,” said Officiating Editor K.V. Prasad in an e-mail.  “The editor-in-chief’s departure came close to the end of the tenure.”         Reporting by Raju Gopalakrishnan; Additional reporting by Tom Lasseter, Sanjeev Miglani; Editing by Martin Howell",4.0
99084,Factbox: UK PM May's Brexit 'plan B' - What happens next in parliament?,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May is seeking to break the parliamentary deadlock over Brexit by proposing to seek further concessions from the European Union on a plan to prevent customs checks on the Irish border.  On Jan. 29, parliament will debate May’s proposed next steps as well as alternative plans put forward by lawmakers, including some that seek to delay Britain’s March 29 exit by requesting an extension to the two-year Article 50 negotiation period.  Some also seek to shift control of the process away from government and give parliament the chance to define Brexit. If successful, this could have a profound effect, giving lawmakers who want to block, delay or renegotiate Brexit a possible legal route to do so.   Below is what is due to happen next:              JAN. 21-29: LAWMAKERS PROPOSE ALTERNATIVES  Lawmakers have begun proposing alternatives to May’s next steps through a parliamentary device known as an amendment. Amendments will be selected on Jan. 29 by speaker John Bercow and can then be put to a vote.   Below are the amendments that have been put forward so far:  Proposed by opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, it calls for parliament to consider alternative options to prevent Britain leaving without a deal, including seeking a permanent customs union with the EU and holding a second referendum.  This is unlikely to be approved as pro-EU Conservative lawmakers have indicated they will not support it.  The pro-EU Liberal Democrats have proposed a change to this amendment so that it would call only for parliament to vote on holding a second referendum and that remaining in the EU should be an option in that referendum.  Put forward by a group of Labour lawmakers, this calls on the government to request an extension to the Article 50 deadline so that a ‘Citizen’s Assembly’ of 250 people can be created to consider the way forward and make recommendations to parliament within 10 weeks of being set up.  This has been put forward by Labour lawmaker Hilary Benn, who chairs parliament’s Brexit select committee. It calls on the government to hold indicative votes on the following options:  1) Holding another vote in parliament on May’s deal  2) Leaving with no deal on March 29  3) Calling on the government to renegotiate May’s deal  4) Holding a second referendum  Proposed by lawmakers from Labour, May’s Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats, this calls on the government to request an extension to the Article 50 deadline.  Put forward by Labour lawmaker Yvette Cooper, it has a strong chance of succeeding as Labour’s finance policy chief has said it is “highly likely” the party will back it and it is also supported by several of May’s Conservative lawmakers. [nL8N1ZN1BT]  It seeks to shift control of Brexit from May’s government to parliament by demanding that on Feb. 5, the rule that government business takes precedence in parliament is overturned.  Providing it has the support of 10 lawmakers, from at least four political parties, it then makes time for a piece of legislation Cooper has proposed, which gives May until Feb. 26 to get a deal approved by parliament.   If the government fails to get a deal through by that date, parliament would be given a vote on asking the EU for a postponement of the Article 50 deadline to prevent Britain leaving without a deal on March 29. It proposes a nine-month extension, to Dec. 31.  This has been proposed by Conservative lawmaker Dominic Grieve and has a chance of succeeding as it is supported by lawmakers from several parties.  It demands that, one day a week in February and March, the rule that government business takes precedence in parliament is overturned, giving lawmakers the opportunity to propose their own debates on Brexit.  Proposed by an independent lawmaker and a member of May’s Conservatives, this amendment calls for parliament to be given votes on a range of Brexit options including leaving without a deal, extending Article 50, leaving with a Canada-style or Norway-style relationship and holding another referendum.  Put forward by Labour and Conservative lawmakers, it seeks to rule out a ‘no deal’ Brexit.  Proposed by Conservative lawmaker Andrew Murrison, it calls for Britain’s exit deal with Brussels to be changed to add an expiry date to the Northern Irish backstop of Dec. 31, 2021.  Parliament will hold a day of debate on May’s proposed next steps and lawmakers’ amendments. They will not be asked to vote to approve a revised Brexit deal at this stage.  A vote in favor of changing the parliamentary rules would change the long-held principle of the British parliament that the government has control of what has the chance to become law.   Votes on alternative types of deal proposed by lawmakers should give an indication of whether there is any way forward supported by a majority in parliament.  If an option were approved by a majority of lawmakers, May could go back to the EU and seek changes to her Brexit deal. Parliament would ultimately still need to vote on any revised deal.

99967,Reader’s Diary: The Potential Novel of a Conceivable Algeria,"The 1950s through the mid-1970s were the great era of the unreadable novel. Kateb Yacine’s Nedjma was one of the first and most remarkable of these. Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads A pianist once explained that, with a score by Mozart, an ability to play the notes gets you only a tenth of the way toward being able to play the music, whereas with one by Liszt, the ability to play the notes gets you nine-tenths of the way toward playing the music. Kateb Yacine’s 1956 novel Nedjma is luxuriant and convoluted like Liszt, not deceptively simple like Mozart, but in my encounter with it I found myself in a position more like that of the amateur attempting Mozart: I read every word, but never felt I was more than a tenth of the way toward having read the novel. And yet not a page passed without my having the feeling that I was experiencing something great. The author’s ambition is tremendous: “to try all conceivable combinations to hold together the potential novel of a conceivable Algeria,” as he later put it. All of these spiraling possibilities — conceivabilities, potentialities — seem to swirl through the book at once. Kateb (he signs his books with his family name first, given name second) distributed the parts of his narrative, or rather his multiple narratives, not chronologically or even according to a subjective chain of associations, but through some numerical system I can’t quite follow — in other words, by a spatial arrangement that disrupts any temporal sequence. And yet a fundamental and seemingly unstoppable narrative force that seems to envelop every detail in a nimbus of resonances keeps the mystified reader turning page after page. This novel, which concerns four men who are all obsessed with a beautiful woman of mixed French and Algerian parentage but is fundamentally about how colonialism makes people outsiders in their own country, is formed out of the direct collision between storytelling — “experience which is passed on from mouth to mouth,” as Walter Benjamin once characterized it — and a modernity in which “experience has fallen in value.” It’s not unique in this. In retrospect, the 1950s through the mid-1970s were the great era of the unreadable novel. Nedjma was one of the first and most remarkable of these; it’s striking that many of the others were also rooted in places marginal to the European mainstream of the novel; I think in particular of works from Latin America, such as Julio Cortázar’s Hopscotch (1963) or José Lezama Lima’s Paradiso (1966). In such works, the conflict between orality and the material manipulability of written texts, between what must be told and what can’t be told, is paramount. A year, now, into this Reader’s Diary, the encounter with Nedjma has made me wonder if there isn’t altogether too much reading go on; maybe I should be spending more time on this kind of unreading. But publishers ought to make that easier; someone should bring Nedjma back into print, and commission translations of Kateb’s other novel, Le polygone étoilé (1966) and his poetry too (judging from Bernard Aresu’s introduction to the 1991 republication of Richard Howard’s exceptional 1961 translation, these all sound like parts of a single intertwined work; his plays, of which one has so far been translated into English, may be something rather different). Kateb Yacine’s Nedjma, translated by Richard Howard (1991) is published by the University Press of Virginia and and is available from Amazon and other online booksellers.",3.0

Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads Fonts are to words what inspiration is to art #DubaiFont A post shared by Dubai Font (@dubaifont) on May 1, 2017 at 12:17am PDT  From ultramodern skyscrapers to artificial islands, Dubai is known for unveiling buzzworthy projects that promote it as a place of innovation. The city’s latest endeavor to brand itself is Dubai Font, a set of type commissioned by the the Crown Prince of Dubai Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, and launched by the executive council of Dubai in partnership with Microsoft. It’s available for anyone to use free of charge, and you can download it online in 23 different languages. Dubai is now the first city to have a specially designed Microsoft font — although it is technically a typeface, available in four weights. The project’s website crows that it’s so much more than just a newcomer to the world of typography; it was honed to reflect the modernity of the city. “It was designed to create harmony between Latin and Arabic,” reads a description. “It is an embodiment of a vision — one of promoting literacy, unity, and forward-thinking laced with tradition, carrying within it aspirations beyond its outlines. It is young, dynamic, and full of passion and energy.” Dubai Font is also supposed to be a “new global medium for self-expression” — which is a pretty peachy claim when you consider the city’s history of censorship. The executive directors of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth and Andrew Stroehlein, were quick to point out the irony of the typeface’s purpose on Twitter, noting that the initiative very likely represents an empty promise of free speech for Dubai’s own citizens.

112353,What is Going on with This 'Darius Fleming Saves a Woman From a Burning Car Crash' Story?,"News spread very quickly this morning that Patriots linebacker Darius Fleming injured himself, requiring 22 stitches, while kicking out a window to save a woman from a burning car after she was involved in a three-car crash. The incident happened two days before the Patriots win over the Kansas City Chiefs last Saturday, but Fleming was able to play anyway. Fleming described a harrowing scene: Fleming then described trying to break through the window with his elbow, before kicking it in and rescuing the woman, who's name he did not get, but who he estimated to be in her 20s. This story went almost a week without being reported, which may have seemed suspicious, or not, depending on your point of view. Lovely. Weird thing is, TMZ went to check into the incident—which according to Fleming happened ""just north of a Dunkin' Donuts on Route 1"" not far from Gillette Stadium—and local fire and EMS crews have no record of such an incident. On top of calling every Dunkin' Donuts on Route 1 in a five mile radius, TMZ also called the following entities: - Massachusetts State Police (We spoke to reps for the state police and the Foxborough barracks)-- Foxborough Police Dept. -- Foxborough Fire Dept. -- Walpole Police Dept.-- Walpole Fire Dept. -- Wrentham Police Dept.-- Wrentham Fire Dept. -- Norwood Police Dept. -- Norwood Fire Dept.-- Plainsville Police Dept & Fire Dept. -- Sharon Fire Dept. Not a single business or department has any record of this crash and ""NO ONE had even heard about a crash matching Fleming's description"" until Fleming spoke about it. Obviously, that doesn't mean it didn't happen, but three cars, one of which caught fire? A semi tractor trailer? An NFL player kicking in a car window in the Massachusetts sticks? And not a single report of anything? This is at least a little strange, and smacks of another story of heroism that turned out not to be so heroic. Back in August of 2014, USC cornerback Josh Shaw was hailed as a hero after he told school officials he injured both of his ankles jumping from a balcony to save his nephew who was drowning in a pool. After a few days it turned out Shaw had actually jumped off the balcony to avoid police after getting into an argument with his girlfriend. Maybe this is just a weird incident that fell through the cracks, or maybe we'll learn more about the Patriot Way in a couple days. Update 4:25 p.m.: As word spread, local beat writers snapped into action and have tracked down an accident in the Walpole police department log—one of the departments TMZ reportedly contacted—that matches up some key elements from Fleming's story. It's a multi-vehicle accident, on Thursday evening on Route 1. Update 4:49 p.m.: The Walpole police department released a statement referencing an unknown ""good Samaritan"" as well as a victim stating that ""a male party 'kicked in my window, I think he was a patriot'."" This was not noted in the report because it was a standard accident with no injuries. You can read the whole thing here. [TMZ]",4.0

122499,Donald Trump's Favorite Fighter Is Fedor Emelianenko … When He's Winning,"Just in time for the much-hyped arrival of Fedor Emelianenko in Bellator this Saturday night the Russian MMA legend's former manager and business partner Vadim Finkelstein appeared on RT Sport this week to talk about Fedor's return to the cage and to reminisce about their time together as the most successful team in Russian MMA history. During the interview Finkelstein spent a few minutes talking about the pair's business dealings with Donald Trump, now the fucking president of the United States but then just a simple real estate tycoon looking to work his way into the world of mixed martial arts promotion. Back in 2008 and 2009 Finkelstein and Emelianenko's M-1 Global organized two events with the Affliction Entertainment promotion on American soil, one featuring Fedor and Tim Sylvia, the other headlined by Fedor and Andrei Arlovski. At the time the majority of shareholder in Affliction was Trump. In the interview Finkelstein says a couple of nice things about the current president of the United States, calling him a ""decent man"" and a ""confident businessman,"" before letting us in on two pieces of information that, while interesting and new, should nevertheless come as no surprise to anyone who's been paying the slightest bit of attention to the world these last two weeks. ""He was always cheering for Fedor,"" Finkelstein remembers of the two Affliction fights, both of which Emelianenko won by first-round knockout. ""He was really happy when Fedor beat Arlovski, despite the fact that Arlovski was technically representing America in this fight, as he speaks good English [and] already had a solid fanbase in the States. But Trump was definitely in Fedor's corner. I saw his reaction after the knockout. He was visibly pumped. He rushed to the ring to congratulate Fedor."" So what do Finkelstein's recollections tell us? Well, first of all, at the same time Trump's handpicked national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has been forced to resign after admitting he lied about discussing American sanctions against Russian with the Russian ambassador to the United States in December and members of Congress and the FBI and the public are calling for a full investigation into what Trump knew about Flynn's interactions with the Russians and how this may have played into that country's clandestine involvement in the American presidential election in November, we get more anecdotal evidence that Trump, even eight years ago, preferred to cheer for a Russian (one of Vladimir Putin's favorites, no less) against someone at least nominally representing America. How perfect it is then that Fedor is making his long-awaited return to American soil right as Trump's Russophilia is blowing up his, and the country's, face. And also, just one week after we learned that Trump left a Super Bowl viewing party during the third quarter when his beloved New England Patriots were losing 28-3 only to tweet enthusiastically about their miraculous comeback an hour later, we have our suspicions confirmed that Trump is the worst kind of front-runner and fair-weather fan. Of course Trump was ""visibly pumped"" when the undefeated and undefeatable Fedor knocked out Arlovksi and of course he rushed to the ring to stand next to him after he did. We all know about Trump's fetish for winners and his need to bask in their reflected glory. But I have no doubt two minutes before that knockout, as the Russian was getting knocked around by Arlovski leg kicks and uppercuts and it looked like the impossible might actually happen, that the now-goddam-Jesus-fucking-Christ-why-have-you-forsaken-us-president of the United States of America was racking his brain thinking of the best way to renounce Fedor and pretend like he had never liked him. Luckily for Trump, Arlovski's ill-conceived flying knee attempt and Fedor's sublime timing spared him that inconvenience. Being a fan of the greatest football team of all time and the greatest fighter of all time must be hard, but Donald Trump, our president, makes it look easy.",3.5

128576,Game of Thrones season 8: why dragons aren’t like nuclear weapons,"I spend a lot of my time at Vox thinking about nuclear weapons. So when I hear talk of the bomb as it relates to Game of Thrones, well, I’m all over it. That’s why I read a recent Washington Post piece by the University of Pennsylvania’s Michael Horowitz and Texas A&M University’s Matthew Fuhrmann, both security experts, with such interest. They argue that comparing the show’s mythical creatures to the world’s deadliest weapons — as George R.R. Martin himself does — is mostly wrong. Instead, they suggest, a single dragon is more like a fighter jet, while more than one comprises an air force of sorts. “Dragons have been employed, both on the show and historically in the universe of [Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire novels], much more like conventional air power,” Horowitz told me when I called him up to further discuss how dragons function in the narrative. He pointed out that so far, we’ve seen the three dragons precisely burn up individuals on a battlefield (RIP, Randyll and Dickon Tarly) but not really cause the widespread chaos that nuclear weapons are known for. That doesn’t mean dragons aren’t destructive, or that they don’t provide Daenerys Targaryen a massive boost in battle. But it does mean that her dragons are beatable — especially if an opposing force has a dragon of its own. So as Game of Thrones fans eagerly anticipate the Westeros-versus-White Walker Great War, I wanted to dig into how useful dragons really are, whether any other Game of Thrones weapons more closely resemble a weapon of mass destruction, and what advantages the Night King has over his opponents, despite having only one dragon to their two. A lightly edited transcript of my conversation with Horowitz follows. Since the dragon eggs first showed up back in season one, I’ve heard so many people compare the dragons to nuclear weapons. Your piece makes the case that they’re not precisely that — so what are they? Nuclear weapons are these special, incredible weapons that changed international politics, and it’s therefore no surprise the comparison has been made time and time again. But dragons actually have a lot more in common with something that we’re a lot more familiar with: conventional air power. When you say air power, you mean that the dragons are more like warplanes — and together an air force — more so than nuclear bombs. Yeah, exactly. There are lots of different ways air power is used. One is called “close air support,” where you use an airplane to attack forces on the battlefield to support your army. Another use of air power is “strategic bombing,” where you might bomb a factory or part of a city to destroy it and aid the war effort. The other use of air power that we’re familiar with from movies like Top Gun, of course, is “dog fighting” or air-to-air combat. We’ve never seen that on Game of Thrones, although in the extended universe of the books, there’s dragon-on-dragon action during the Dance of the Dragons. And who knows, we may see it when the White Walkers and Westerosi troops face off this season. In the real world, a country develops or obtains nuclear weapons partly as a deterrent, meaning it makes another country think twice before attacking because no one wants a nuclear bomb used against it. But the dragons don’t really give Daenerys Targaryen that advantage, right? They make her a formidable opponent, but not a guaranteed existential risk to an opposing force. Armies facing dragons don’t have “air superiority,” to use the military term of art, but they still have options. They have surface-to-air weapons, primarily scorpion bolts, which are essentially enormous crossbows that fire, well, bolts. In the history of Westeros that George R.R. Martin has written, those bolts have occasionally killed dragons. An army facing a dragon should be worried, but there actually are defenses that can be used against it. Is there a weapon in the Game of Thrones universe that more closely resembles nuclear weapons than dragons? In my mind wildfire is much more a weapon of mass destruction than a dragon. I’m still recovering from when Cersei blew up a major part of King’s Landing and killed scores of principal characters at the end of season six. I actually think you’re right on. Wildfire in the Game of Thrones universe, to me, looks more like chemical and biological weapons in that they’re hard to contain and they’re not very good battlefield weapons in general, with the exclusion of the naval battle that we saw in season two. But wildfire is aptly named in that it can cause mass destruction pretty quickly, and there’s no real known defense against it. That makes it, I think, a lot more like chemical and biological weapons, which are generally thought to be inferior to nuclear weapons but certainly have mass destructive qualities. Compare, for example, the firebombing of Tokyo, which took hundreds of aircraft dropping thousands of bombs, to the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, which took just one bomb each. There’s nothing quite like that in the Game of Thrones universe, at least that we’ve seen so far. I think the dragons-as-nuclear-weapons theory works, though, as long as you’re willing to use them solely to wreak extensive havoc. Had Daenerys approved or gone through with the idea of burning down King’s Landing — or torching anything she wants, really — then I think it makes some sense. But she’s shown restraint. Perhaps dragons can be used as nuclear weapons, so to speak, but so far, she’s used them in more precise ways. I would say yes, and the only thing I would add to that is that I think you have better defensive options against dragons than you do against nuclear weapons. Not that they’re great. I mean, think about the javelin throw from the Night King. That’s pretty epic. But I think it’s true that dragons have been employed, both on the show and historically in the universe of the books, much more like conventional air power. Has Daenerys Targaryen used her fighter jets-cum-dragons well? In other words, has she capitalized on her military advantage? She’s tried to conserve the advantage to use the dragons when it’s truly important. For example, she [fought the impulse] to burn King’s Landing to the ground, which Tyrion convinced her not to do because it wouldn’t endear her to the people of Westeros. But more importantly, Daenerys hasn’t yet had to use her dragons in a battle where her forces would probably lose otherwise, excluding the excursion to the North at the end of season seven. [Earlier in season seven, during] the loot train battle, the Dothraki actually might have had that battle in hand regardless. The dragons were still helpful, of course. It’ll be very interesting to see how she chooses to use her dragons against the White Walkers. As you mentioned earlier, we haven’t seen a dragon-on-dragon fight yet. But now that the Night King has a zombie dragon, we may see one before the series is over. Does that change how Daenerys must use her two dragons? If you’re Daenerys and you have two dragons and the other side has one, you’ve got a couple of different options. One would be letting the dragons loose on the battlefield because you have more of them and the biggest dragon overall, all while keeping an eye on the Night King. But if the Night King shows up riding Viserion, you immediately need to divert at least one, maybe both of your dragons to go after him. We saw what that blue flame did to the Wall at the end of the last season. What would it do to the Unsullied? What would it do to the Dothraki? What would it do to the Free Folk? The presence of the Night King’s dragon will become critical to the fight, and it will likely divert Daenerys’s dragons potentially from their close-air-support mission. Since we’re on the Night King, what advantages does he have? Oh, man, he has two incredible advantages. First, anybody you kill joins your army. And second, you don’t have to worry about feeding them. Logistics are critical to warfare. Think about Sansa’s comment in this season’s first episode about, “How are we supposed to feed this army that just marched north?” The Night King doesn’t have to worry about that. If you don’t have to worry about feeding your army, and anybody you kill becomes part of it, those are some pretty good odds on your side. As we close here, I always remind myself that George R.R. Martin himself has compared dragons in the Game of Thrones universe to nuclear weapons. That counts for something, right? Yes, but again: The way he describes their usage — both in his books and then the way the show expresses them — is a lot more like conventional air power. So while I obviously have my views on this, it’s his world, man. And who knows what’ll happen over the last five episodes.",3.5

143799,"For third straight time, Earth sets hottest year record","WASHINGTON (AP) — Government scientists say the Earth sizzled to a third straight heat record last year.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Earth sizzled to a third-straight record hot year in 2016, government scientists said Wednesday. They mostly blame man-made global warming with help from a natural El Nino, which has since disappeared. Measuring global temperatures in slightly different ways, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that last year passed 2015 as the hottest year on record. NOAA calculated that the average 2016 global temperature was 58.69 degrees (14.84 degrees Celsius) — beating the previous year by 0.07 degrees (0.04 Celsius). NASA's figures, which include more of the Arctic, are higher at 0.22 degrees (0.12 Celsius) warmer than 2015. The Arctic ""was enormously warm, like totally off the charts compared to everything else,"" said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute of Space Studies in New York, where the space agency monitors global temperatures. Records go back to 1880. This is the fifth time in a dozen years that the globe has set a new annual heat record. Records have been set in 2016, 2015, 2014, 2010 and 2005. The World Meteorological Organization and other international weather monitoring groups agreed that 2016 was a record, with the international weather agency chief Petteri Taalas saying ""temperatures only tell part of the story"" of extreme warming. ""This is clearly a record,"" NASA's Schmidt said in an interview. ""We are now no longer only looking at something that only scientists can see, but is apparent to people in our daily lives."" Schmidt said his calculations show most of the record heat was from heat-trapping gases from the burning of oil, coal and gas. Only about 12 percent was due to El Nino, which is a periodic warming of parts of the Pacific that change weather globally, he said. ""Of course this is climate change, it's overwhelmingly climate change,"" said Corinne Le Quere, director of England's Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, who wasn't part of the NOAA or NASA teams. ""Warming (is) nearly everywhere. The Arctic sea ice is collapsing. Spikes in fires from the heat. Heavy rainfall from more water vapor in the air."" According to NOAA, 2016 was 1.69 degrees (0.94 degrees Celsius) warmer than the 20th Century average. The first eight months of 2016 all broke heat records. NASA has last year at 1.78 degrees (0.99 degrees Celsius) warmer than their mid-20th Century average and about 2 degrees warmer than the start of the industrial age in the late 19th Century. The effects are more than just records, but actually hurt people and the environment, said Oklahoma University meteorology professor Jason Furtado. They're ""harmful on several levels, including human welfare, ecology, economics, and even geopolitics,"" he said.",4.5
148911,"Attacks on Artistic Freedom Almost Doubled Worldwide in 2015, Report Says","Advertise on Hyperallergic with Nectar Ads ISIS’s November 13 massacre at an Eagles of Death Metal concert in Paris’ Bataclan theater, which left 89 people dead and 99 more critically injured, was part of one of the worst terrorist attacks in French history. It was also the most devastating attacks on artistic freedom in 2015, stoking a climate of fear around the world and leading to concerts and cultural events being cancelled.  The massacre was part of a sharp, worldwide increase in attacks on artistic expression last year, according to a new report, “Art Under Threat,” released today by Freemuse. The organization, which aims to defend artistic freedom around the world, registered a total 469 cases of censorship and attacks in 2015 — nearly a twofold increase (98%) from 2014. Most attacks were either politically or religiously motivated.   Some of the report’s most significant findings include: There are no real statistics available on film censorship, as “the global film industry ignores its responsibility to register and report on films either being stopped by censors before production or films being censored for screenings.” The numbers in the report reflect only registered attacks on artistic freedom; the authors explain what this means: The statistics are based on a combination of open sources — such as incidents reported in media worldwide — and whatever verified information Freemuse can collect from network partners and stringers all over the world. The artsfex network is an important platform for collaborations and exchange of information with local, regional and international sister organisations advocating artistic freedom. We consider a case “confirmed” only if we are reasonably certain that an artist was targeted in reprisal for his or her artistic work. Freemuse conducts its own independent research based on various sources to determine the motive. When authorities make up false accusations such as economic fraud or drug possession in an attempt to silence an artist, the case is included in the statistics.  The numbers thus represent a cautious estimate, since most violations go unreported. “Artistic freedom violations continue to be under-reported in many countries due to lack of awareness, registration and reporting capacity,” Freemuse Executive Director Ole Reitov said in a statement. “Artistic creativity demands an environment free from fear and insecurity. Although states are the main violators, increasingly, threats from non-state actors are leading to fear and self-censorship. At the UN level there have been positive signs of larger attention being paid to the importance of protecting artistic freedom, but 2015 was in general a dark year for artistic freedom.” In September 2015, at the 30th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, the ambassador of Latvia, Janis Karklins, reaffirmed the UN’s mission to protect creative freedom. “We stand firm in our commitment to protect and promote the right to freedom of expression, including artistic and creative expression,” Karklins told the council — though only 53 of the UN’s 193 member states supported the statement. “In addition to being an integral part of the protected human right to freedom of expression, artistic and creative expression is critical to the human spirit, the development of vibrant cultures, and the functioning of democratic societies. Artistic expression connects us all, transcending borders and barriers. Artistic expression can challenge us and change the way we view the world.” To read the full report, including in-depth analyses of artistic freedom violations in individual countries, go here.",4.0

154518,Shitty Media Men List creator Moira Donegan on the year in #MeToo,"A year ago this month, the New York media scene was rocked by the creation and covert distribution of the Shitty Media Men list. The list was a Google spreadsheet of anonymous, crowdsourced accusations of sexual misconduct against men working in the media, and it rapidly became a symbol of all the dangers and possibilities of the ascendent #MeToo movement: It stood for the idea that now, at last, women could finally protect themselves from predatory men — and for the idea that such attempts at protection had gone too far and were robbing men of their due process. The list was rapidly deleted, but copies abounded across the internet. It was explosive. Formal complaints were filed against some of the men named on the list. Some of them were investigated, and a few ultimately lost their jobs. Then in January, the media world experienced a second explosion. Rumors emerged suggesting that the writer Katie Roiphe planned to name the creator of the list against her will in an article in Harper’s magazine. Roiphe’s rumored decision was met with widespread backlash, and a group of women banded together to take credit for the list themselves, “I am Spartacus” style. But to head off Roiphe, the creator stepped forward herself. “I Started the Media Men List,” Moira Donegan wrote at the Cut. Donegan is a writer who when she started the list was working as an assistant editor for the New Republic and who later left the magazine; a spokesperson for the New Republic told Vox in January that Donegan’s departure had nothing to do with the list. “The value of the spreadsheet was that it had no enforcement mechanisms,” Donegan explained: “Without legal authority or professional power, it offered an impartial, rather than adversarial, tool to those who used it. It was intended specifically not to inflict consequences, not to be a weapon — and yet, once it became public, many people immediately saw it as exactly that.” One of those who saw it as a weapon was Stephen Elliott, the founder and former editor-in-chief of the Rumpus, who was named on the list. Last week, he filed a defamation suit against Donegan, demanding $1.5 million in damages. The day before Elliott filed his lawsuit, I spoke with Donegan over the phone. We discussed the arc of the #MeToo movement, what led it to erupt into the public consciousness, and where it can go from here. Donegan declined to make any follow-up statement addressing Elliott’s suit after it was filed, but our initial conversation touched on why she created the list, how her thinking about it has changed over time, and what her life has been like since she came forward as its creator. “It’s not something I would wish on anyone,” she says. The following interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. How do you think the past year of discourse has affected the way we talk about gender and sexual violence? One of the biggest things I try to remember is that this conversation has actually been going on for a lot longer than just the year. Not only #MeToo as a movement, which of course Tarana Burke started in 2007, but also conversations about sexual violence, sexual assault, and gendered and power imbalances have been going on in a feminist context and a populist context for a really long time. Something I was talking with some of my heroes about this past weekend was how much #MeToo reminds us of this second-wave practice called consciousness-raising, in which women would sit together in person, on floors or in university classrooms or in coffee shops, and talk about the ways sexism impacted their lives. In particular, there were a lot of first-person stories of enduring sexual harassment. This method that women have had of using the female first person and their own experiences as a way to try to draw a connection between the personal and the political, and to try to effect meaningful change, this has been going on for a really long time. But renewed energy and excitement that we’ve seen over the past year, and the sense of real urgency around these questions, it’s all been building, really, for decades. So why do you think it exploded last year with the Harvey Weinstein allegations? A lot of other people have articulated this better than I have, but in the year, two years before that Weinstein story broke, there were a lot of public egregious examples of women’s suffering and women’s testimony not effecting any change. I think people forget that before he was eventually convicted, Bill Cosby, who had something like 60 accusers, had a mistrial. Before the election in 2016, that Access Hollywood tape where Trump bragged about committing sexual assault did not affect his chances of becoming president. There was this growing sense that the truth could come out about what women experience and it wouldn’t effect a change. I think people got very angry. There was also what Soraya Chemaly, the author of Rage Becomes Her, described to me as a hashtag genealogy. She was talking to me about the ways that these conversations around sexual violence and sexual assault have been facilitated and sped up by social media: the 2014 hashtag #YesAllWomen, which dealt with the prevalence of sexual harassment and sexual assault; and then this 2016 hashtag after that Access Hollywood tape was released called #NotOkay, which gathered a lot of the same stories. So there was already a tradition, and there was also this growing unwillingness to accept the status quo. And so when the Weinstein stories come out, not only was the behavior really egregious and disgusting and very sad-making, but it was also devastatingly familiar. A lot of people who read those stories, not only in media or in Hollywood, a lot of people around the country read those and said, “Hey, yeah, I have a guy who does this, to maybe a less extreme degree, but who uses his power against women in this sexually predatory way in my industry too. I’ve seen this before. And yes, we are used to him just getting away with it, and why is that?” The field was primed for people who were very upset about feeling powerless over this kind of violence and wanted to do something to change that. Are the changes in the way we talk about this kind of violence getting reflected in concrete changes, or is it purely rhetorical, or is it some sort of combination, do you think? #MeToo and the feminist social movement generally is much bigger than individual media moments. It’s very tempting right now, when Brett Kavanaugh has just been appointed to the Supreme Court after very moving and upsetting testimony from Dr. [Christine Blasey] Ford and credible allegations from other women, to say, “Well, clearly that means the #MeToo movement has failed because this guy got this one job.” But it’s a social movement that’s bigger than one guy and one job. It’s going to go on for much longer. There’s not going to be an endpoint at which we all get to say, “Oh, great, we solved gender.” This is an ongoing fight. The thing about #MeToo in particular is it has this dual mandate. The first job is to help survivors, to try to facilitate opportunities for healing and for honesty. The opportunity to be honest about about one’s experience of sexual violence has been much more rare than the experience of sexual violence itself. So that’s the first daunting chance. The second daunting task is to try to change norms. To try to make sure that this violence becomes less socially acceptable, less normal, less commonplace, and to try to make sure that fewer people suffer in the future. That’s all going to be difficult to measure, and it’s not going to be something that can be easily quantified, but I do think we’ve taken a big step in the right direction. Prior to the Ford-Kavanaugh hearings, there was a narrative that the #MeToo movement was starting to wind down or beginning to lack in energy. There were some comparisons to the Year of the Woman in 1992, which kind of plateaued. Then the accusations against Kavanaugh prompted this enormous burst of activity. Do you have any ideas about whether we’ll see this movement plateauing in the wake of Kavanaugh’s confirmation, or whether it will evolve into a new phase of things? I can’t predict the future, but I had — and I know a lot of other feminists had as well — a fear or a self-protective lowering of expectations where we thought, “This will be a moment, we will be able to effect a limited amount of positive change in this moment, and then the movie cycle will move on and the culture will move on.” But I think that approach underestimated women’s anger in this moment, and women’s desire to no longer be powerless. There’s been a sense that women can say our own experiences all we want and it won’t change anything, and I think people are very sick of it. I don’t think we should underestimate women’s capacities right now. I think a lot of folks are wondering what’s next after we share our stories, and how we otherwise build power to try and help survivors heal and help prevent this violence in the future. But I don’t think we can write it off as something that’s going to pass and recede into memory. I think it’s different than that this time. In her new book Good and Mad, Rebecca Traister describes the Shitty Media Men list as “the first time [she] had experienced anything like radicalism in [her] own sphere,” which she is somewhat ambivalent about but ultimately seems to find exciting. Do you think of the list as radical, or did you when you created it? When I created that document, I was responding to a feeling of powerlessness, a feeling that official sanctioned avenues served to discredit and further victimize survivors. It came for me from a place of frustration and powerlessness and, really, fear about how to protect myself and about how to protect my colleagues and the women around me from this kind of violence. The spreadsheet and its tactics are something that reasonable people can disagree about. I’ve read a lot of very thoughtful good-faith feminist critiques of the document’s tactics, and I’ve done a lot of reflection on the document’s tactics myself. But I think there is a growing understanding that the ways we have to report this do not serve survivors, and often tend to re-victimize people who’ve already been through something that they shouldn’t have had to go through. So I do think people are thinking more about our reporting mechanisms and how they might be improved. One of the persistent narratives that we keep seeing over the past year, that people use to discredit women making allegations of sexual violence, is that they are just doing it for the attention, and that being a woman who has made such an accusation in public is somehow a super-fun and profitable experience that yields both fame and fortune. I wonder if you can speak to what the past few months have been like for you after coming forward about creating the list, and perhaps clarify what that experience is actually like. Speaking in public about sexual violence is terrifying. It is not fun. It is not personally fulfilling. It is very upsetting. It involves a lot of intense scrutiny of your own motives and behavior, and it can often be frustrating to have the focus be so much on the survivors in contrast to the focus being on the perpetrators or alleged perpetrators. I was very frightened when I had to publicly come forward, and I experienced a lot of unpleasantness in those months after, which to varying degrees has persisted and has come back in waves. It’s not something I would wish on anyone. So we’ve talked a little bit about the two current goals of the #MeToo movement: to help survivors and to change norms. What do you think changing norms would look like moving forward? What needs to change, and do you think it can? That’s a big and hard question. I think a lot of people are wondering what to do with this new knowledge of the quantity of survivors’ pain, and in particular of female survivors’ pain, and this information about a lot of malice and obliviousness and predatory behavior by perpetrators. I think we need to find ways of accountability and healing that are new, because the methods of accountability that we’ve developed so far have not been productive and have not significantly altered the prevalence of this kind of violence. I think there has to be a lot of real soul-searching and thinking about how sex education works, how we want our interpersonal relationships and work relationships to function with the most respect and mutual care that we can. And I think we have to think a lot about what we all need to learn. I’m including myself and survivors in this as well as perpetrators, and people who are trying to go about the world trying to avoid pain and avoid causing pain. I think we all need to think a lot more about the ways we’re treating others, and how we bear witness to other people’s needs.",4.0
154957,Autopsy of Italian Student Murdered in Egypt Said to Reveal Signs of Brutal Interrogation,"An Egyptian forensics official has told the public prosecutor's office the autopsy he conducted on an Italian student showed he was interrogated for up to seven days before he was killed, two prosecution sources said.

""Abdel Hamid said during the questioning that the wounds on the body occurred over different intervals of between 10-14 hours. That means that whoever is accused of killing him was interrogating him for information."" Related: Medical Workers Violate Egyptian Protest Ban After Police Brutally Beat Doctors The state news agency said Shaaban al-Shami, assistant to the justice minister on forensic medical affairs, had denied Abdel Hamid was questioned by the public prosecutor's office. The main Interior Ministry spokesman was not available for comment. Another Interior Ministry spokesman, asked by Reuters to comment on the findings, said: ""I know nothing about this matter."" A source in the Department of Forensic Medicine confirmed Abdel Hamid had been questioned. Reuters reached Abdel Hamid by telephone but he declined to comment. Regeni, 28, disappeared on January 25, the anniversary of the 2011 uprising that ended former President Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule. Regeni had written articles critical of the Egyptian government, the Italian newspaper that published them said. The broken corpse of the Cambridge University student, who was researching the rise of independent labor unions following the 2011 revolt, was found in a ditch on the side of a motorway on February 3. Egyptian forensics and prosecution officials have said his body showed signs of torture and that he was killed by a blow with a sharp object to the back of the head. Related: Calls for Justice Increase Amid Mourning for Murdered Student Giulio Regeni ""The autopsy report shows a number of injuries at one time; and there are a number of other injuries later and other injuries a third time,"" said another investigator in the public prosecutor's office, summarizing Abdel Hamid's statements. ""The wounds and fractures occurred at different times in intervals during a period of about five to seven days."" The case has put a spotlight on alleged police brutality in Egypt, a strategic ally of the United State and other Western powers. Shopkeepers in Regeni's neighborhood of Cairo said there were no signs that police in the area had been questioning people since his disappearance or death. Rights groups accuse the police of widespread abuses against Egyptians since the army toppled Egypt's first freely elected president in 2013. Such actions against foreigners are not common. Italy has said Egyptian investigators should hand over the evidence they have uncovered on Regeni's death. Egypt invited Italian investigators to take part in the investigation, but judicial sources in Rome say the collaboration has been limited because not enough information was shared. A second autopsy in Italy ""confronted us with something inhuman, something animal,"" Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfa has said without elaborating further.

156604,Photoshop gaffe embarrasses Australian prime minister with two left feet,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison was left red-faced on Wednesday after a family photograph, doctored by his staff, inadvertently left him with two left feet - an embarrassing image as he tries to end missteps months before an election.  The new image of Morrison with his wife and two children was meant to be his new official photograph for his personal website. However, his staff, keen to remove the prime minister’s scruffy shoes, Photoshopped him with two left feet.  The mistake was widely mocked on social media.  A spokesman for the prime minister said the picture was changed by staff without Morrison’s knowledge or authorization.  Morrison took to Twitter in a bid to limit the damage,  joking that staff could instead have improved his thinning hairline.  Analysts said the incident was a blow to the government’s re-election campaign, with Morrison’s Liberal-National coalition badly trailing the Labor opposition in opinion polls and on course for a heavy defeat in polls due by May.  “To be re-elected, Morrison needs everything to go right and ridicule is the absolute last thing he needs,” said Haydon Manning, professor of politics at Flinders University in South Australia.  Morrison has yet to confirm the date of the election. He    became Australia’s sixth different leader in less than 10 years late last year and has seen his standing with voters hampered by a series of missteps.  Desperate to focus national attention on the healthy state of Australia’s economy, Morrison has moved to clear his legislative agenda of any more potential pitfalls.  He will accelerate his re-election campaign in April when his government delivers its annual budget, which many expect to include tax cuts.  Reporting by Colin Packham",4.5
162237,A 'Rick and Morty' Fan Reimagined the Intro as an Over-the-Top Anime,"A lot of people compare Rick and Morty to Japanese animation for its wildness, innovation, and focus on teenage emotions. Its visuals are innovative for American animation, but French animator Malec dropped a video over the weekend that shows how dazzling it could be if reimagined in the style of anime. Malec and his team, who also anime-fied Game of Thrones and produces a series of pop-culture rap battles, transformed the Smith-Sanchez clan into the blushing, bubble-eyed, spiky-haired bodies characteristic of Japanese animation for their short, If Rick And Morty Was An Anime. Fan-favorite snippets from the series, like buff Summer, Pickle Rick, wine-drunk Beth, and Jerry's dumb hat are all spliced into a 90-second remake of Rick and Morty's intro theme. KronoMuzik's splendidly generic anime music soundtrack is an excellent touch.  The video is cool because it knows its audience. Rick and Morty fans are incredibly thirsty for an anime crossover. ""Rick and Morty is anime "" is a recurring Twitter troll that's met with 50 shades of ironic derision, unironic scorn, and wistfulness for an actual Rick and Morty anime episode.  Members of the media are even more dazzled by the idea than fans on Twitter. In August, Titmouse's Anthony F. Schepperd animated an X-Men inspired promo for the show, which publications said, ""Depicts an insane new season,"" and ""Promises an absolutely epic new season,"" implying ""anime action"" would play a role in future episodes. In reality, Adult Swim hires young animators to use their characters in experimental bumps all the time, and they never have anything to do with the show itself. Stop-motion animator Lee Hardcastle did a series called The Non-Canonical Adventures of Rick and Morty to quash any suspicion that they have bearing on the show itself.  Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland owe Adult Swim 70 episodes of Rick and Morty. That's a lot of chances to cave to their audience and do an anime episode, the same way Harmon did a whole claymation episode of his previous NBC series, Community. However, if he and Roiland are as committed to ignoring anime fans as they are to shutting out deep conspiracy theorists, then it won't happen any time soon.

176619,The Senate failed on immigration. No one knows what’s next.,"The Senate has left town without a deal on immigration. After months of failed negotiations, senators voted down four immigration proposals Thursday. The bill that had President Donald Trump’s blessing received the fewest votes. The only comprehensive bipartisan proposal on the table not only failed to win enough votes, but was also panned by Trump’s administration. This week was meant to be dedicated to robust and open immigration debate — a promise Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made to Senate Democrats to end the three-day government shutdown in January. But what was supposed to result in an immigration bill ultimately ended in only an hour and a half of actual action on the Senate floor, and nothing to show for it. “I think we had 13.3 total minutes of debate,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) said. The Trump administration has pledged to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program by March 5, a date by which Congress had to pass some kind of legislative fix for the roughly 690,000 undocumented immigrants whose legal protections will be put in limbo. That’s now unlikely. Republican senators appear to have thrown their hands up in the air finding a solution. Two senators, Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD), who had been a lead negotiator on the bipartisan proposal, and Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), who sponsored the proposal mirroring the White House’s framework, said their work wasn’t done, but they wouldn’t be coming back to immigration anytime soon. “I think a couple weeks,” Rounds said of when the Senate might revisit immigration — certainly not by the March 5 date, he added. Congress also has a government spending deadline on March 23, which some said could set up another immigration fight. But for now, senators seem to be on the hunt for the path of least resistance. So far, the Trump administration has called for a framework for a path to citizenship for 1.8 million DREAMers, in exchange for border wall funding, an end to the diversity visa lottery program, and substantial cuts to family immigration — to stop “chain migration” — which critics say would gut the legal immigration system by up to 40 percent. The far-reaching demands have proven to be far too conservative for Democrats and many Republicans to sign on to. So now senators like GOP Sens. John Thune (R-SD), Rob Portman (R-OH), and Jerry Moran (R-KS) are floating a narrow backup plan that would enshrine DACA into law — without offering a path to citizenship — in exchange for $25 billion for border security, capped at $5 billion per year. There are a number of similar proposals that would “punt” on DACA. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) has proposed extending DACA for three years, until Congress can think of a more permanent solution. It’s not clear whether the Trump administration would go for a narrower proposal. Meanwhile, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who sponsored the White House-inspired bill, said it’s now up to the House to make the next move on immigration. The politics in the House are even more fraught than in the Senate, where Paul Ryan has promised only to vote on a bill that has the support of the president and the majority of the Republican caucus. Ryan has promised House conservatives to whip votes for a partisan bill from Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), which has no future in the Senate. Without a clear path forward, at least one Republican senator has given up completely. “There is no next move,” Kennedy said, listing other priorities from government spending to infrastructure. “I’m ready to move on. We just wasted a whole week.” As for the DREAMers? “I don’t know what to tell them,” he said.",4.0
177866,"After Park, former South Korean President Lee summoned over bribery allegations","SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean prosecutors have called former President Lee Myung-bak to appear for questioning over allegations he took bribes when in office, a prosecutor said on Tuesday in the latest top-level political corruption scandal to rock the country.   Prosecutors last month sought a 30-year jail term for former President Park Geun-hye, Lee’s successor, who was ousted last year amid an influence-peddling scandal and is standing trial on charges of bribery, abuse of power and coercion.  Lee was asked to present himself for questioning on March 14, the senior prosecutor said.   “We must question (Lee) to reveal the truth”, the prosecutor told reporters.   “We expect him to show up since we gave sufficient time for him to prepare for the questioning”.  Lee has denied any wrongdoing, calling the investigation into the bribery allegations, summoning his family and confidants and raiding their homes and offices, politically motivated.  Lee was not immediately reachable for comment on Tuesday.  Last month, Seoul prosecutors searched the offices of Samsung Electronics as part of the investigation, the prosecutors’ office said.   They were looking for possible evidence that Samsung provided financial support for an auto parts maker run by Lee’s family and allegedly controlled by him, the prosecutors’ office said. Samsung has said it has no official comment.  The heir to parent Samsung Group, Jay Y. Lee, was freed last month with a suspended jail sentence on bribery and embezzlement charges linked to the Park corruption case.  Reporting by Hyonhee Shin; Editing by Nick Macfie",4.5

Maggie Wilderotter is the executive chairman of Frontier Communications, a phone and Internet provider. She had been its CEO from 2006 to 2015. Before Frontier, she was a senior VP of worldwide public sector at Microsoft. She also sits on the boards of DreamWorks Animation, Juno Therapeutics and Costco. Wilderotter is the first new member — there are now 13 — to join HPE’s board since Hewlwtt-Packard formally split into two companies late last year. At the time, the company got high marks from activist Jesse Jackson for paying close attention to the diversity of the two boards the companies created. She is the fifth woman named to the board. Of the 13 directors, six, including Wilderotter, are new to HPE and to its predecessor Hewlett-Packard, while seven are left from the board of the old HP.

182113,Art Responding to Birds and Their Habitats at One of New York's Great Natural Escapes,"Avifauna at Wave Hill in the Bronx features art responding to the lives of birds in New York City and beyond. Did you know that 2018 is the Year of the Bird? Earlier this year the National Audubon Society, National Geographic, BirdLife International, and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology announced this yearlong avian commemoration, timed with the 100th anniversary of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. It celebrates that act’s protection of migratory birds, and recognizes the enduring threats to their natural and urban habitats. At Wave Hill in the Bronx, there are two exhibitions that consider the modern bird. Although not affiliated with the Year of the Bird, they’re lively portals into conservation, the biodiversity of New York City, and the artistic influence of birds. Avifauna: Birds + Habitat is a group exhibition in the Glyndor Gallery focuses on these ideas, and the smaller solo show Ecolegiac: Missing Birds of NYC in the Wave Hill House features Gabriel Willow’s drawings of extinct area birds overlaid on contemporary photographs. Labrador ducks, last seen in 1878, are returned to the East River, and Carolina parakeets, extinct in the wild since 1904, perch in the trees of Union Square. Willow, who is both an artist and a naturalist who leads birding tours at Wave Hill, served as an advisor for Avifauna. Organized by Jennifer McGregor, Eileen Jeng Lynch, and Natika Soward, the exhibition takes a broad view, from artists who are birders like Fred Tomaselli and Peter Morgan — the latter sculpts larger-than-life ceramics of his sightings — to a sound installation by Jenna Spevack. Birdsongs are powered by pinwheels outside one window, each representing a different local bird, whether the house finch or mourning dove, with the level of wind making its call either calm or a cacophony. The two artists play on our tendency to idealize nature, with Paula McCartney’s photographs of craft-store birds positioned in the wild, scientific labels adding to their deception, and Nina Katchadourian’s ambiguous “Too Late” (2003), which includes those ominous words on the eggs in a bird’s nest. Despite the eclectic range of the art, the exhibition is not overwhelming in its material, and all the work draws attention to the sometimes precarious world of birds around us. Many pieces directly respond to the local ecology. Jeff Mertz’s video documentary has bird footage from Wave Hill, Central Park, Prospect Park, Jamaica Bay, and Governors Island, while Tanya Chaly was inspired by Eugene Bicknell, one of the first naturalists to study bird variety in the Bronx and the Riverdale neighborhood in which Wave Hill is located. Her drawings of birds, framed beneath convex glass, like Victorian specimens, are punctured with patterns of migration paths, food webs, and other charts sourced from scientific documents. Sarah Nicholls similarly investigated nature close to home, creating artist books that act as field guides on urban wildlife, such as the shore birds and osprey of Jamaica Bay. One whole room is consumed by James Prosek’s wall painting, which has silhouettes of a blooming dogwood tree and spring birds, particularly warblers, in a style reminiscent of birding guidebooks. In the next space, Marna Chester’s sculptures of bald eagles are supported by frames made from compost and other natural material found at Wave Hill. Step out from the gallery, and you’ll notice tropical birds perched in the bushes and trees. They’re part of Tatiana Arocha’s ongoing Perpetual Flight project. The digital painting series visualizes birds that are being thrown off their usual migration courses because of climate change, and it was sparked by the painted bunting that caused a stir when it appeared in Brooklyn’s Prospect Park in 2015, diverted from its historic migration path. As the birds return to New York City this spring, including lush escapes like Wave Hill, it’s worth taking a moment to observe their flight and habitats. Climate change and urban development impact the future of all species who call this area home, and recognizing and protecting the lives of birds can have implications beyond the avian world. Avifauna: Birds + Habitat continues through June 24 and Ecolegiac: Missing Birds of NYC continues through June 17 at Wave Hill (675 West 252nd Street, The Bronx). ",4.0
182414,Wynn Resorts board sued for failing to investigate chief executive,"WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - The board of Wynn Resorts (WYNN.O) has been sued by shareholders, claiming the board knew for years that Steve Wynn, founder and chief executive of the casino operator, had been accused of sexual misconduct and failed to investigate.  The company declined to comment.  Wynn resigned on Tuesday after accusations of sexual misconduct by women who worked for him, becoming one of the biggest names in the business world to quit over such accusations. The accusations were reported by the Wall Street Journal in January.  Wynn has called the claims “preposterous” and the board of Wynn Resorts has said it was investigating.  Casino veteran Matt Maddox has replaced Wynn as chief executive of Wynn Resorts.  Shares in Wynn Resorts, which owns the Wynn, Encore Las Vegas casinos and Wynn Macau unit, have declined nearly 20 percent since the newspaper report on Jan 26. The company is worth around $17 billion by market capitalization.  The case is a derivative lawsuit, meaning any damages paid by Wynn and the other board members who are named defendants would be paid to Wynn Resorts, not directly to investors.  The lawsuit filed in Clark County, Nevada, claimed, based on press reports, that “a board representative” was notified of Wynn’s alleged misconduct in 2009 by Wynn’s then-wife Elaine.   The Norfolk County Retirement System, a Wynn Resorts investor, claimed in the lawsuit that the board should have known of its founder’s misconduct by 2015 when a lawsuit by Elaine Wynn accused her former husband of “reckless risk-taking behavior.”  The lawsuit said the board breached its fiduciary duty to investors by not investigating the accusations and by continuing to recommend Wynn’s leadership to investors.  Wynn Resorts illustrates the risk to a company’s stock from misconduct accusations against an executive.  The company has formed a special committee to investigate Wynn, which is often used as a defense against a derivative lawsuit. The plaintiff said the directors on the special committee were not truly independent of Wynn.  Dozens of high-profile men have been fired or have resigned from their jobs in politics, media, entertainment and business after facing accusations of sexual misconduct.  Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) reached a $90 million settlement of shareholder claims over harassment allegations at its Fox News Channel, which cost the jobs of longtime news chief Roger Ailes and anchor Bill O’Reilly.

Japan’s U.N. Ambassador Koro Bessho, president of the 15-member council for December, said several ministers were confirmed to attend the Dec. 15 meeting. He also said the meeting on human rights in North Korea could be held on Dec. 11.   China has unsuccessfully tried to stop three previous human rights meetings by calling a procedural vote. A minimum of nine votes are needed to win such a vote and China, Russia, the United States, Britain and France cannot wield their vetoes.  This year’s meeting has the backing of nine members - the United States, France, Britain, Italy, Japan, Senegal, Sweden, Ukraine and Uruguay.   Last year, the United States angered North Korea by blacklisting its leader Kim Jong Un for human rights abuses.  A landmark 2014 U.N. report on North Korean human rights concluded that North Korean security chiefs - and possibly Kim himself - should face justice for overseeing a state-controlled system of Nazi-style atrocities.  Michael Kirby, chairman of the U.N. Commission of Inquiry that drew up the report, said at the time that the crimes the team had cataloged were reminiscent of those committed by the Nazis during World War Two. “Some of them are strikingly similar,” he told Reuters.  North Korea has repeatedly rejected accusations of human rights abuses and blames sanctions for a dire humanitarian situation. Pyongyang has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missiles and nuclear programs.   “Despite persistent sanctions and pressure by the U.S. and other hostile forces, my government concentrates all its efforts on improving people’s livelihood and providing them with a better future,” the North Korean Permanent Mission to the United Nations said in a statement on Nov. 14.

Rick Neuheisel is offering advice to the XFL in the wake of the AAF's colossal collapse -- ""Start with enough money!!!"" ""At the end of the day, you gotta have enough financing,"" the former Arizona Hotshots' head coach says.

207921,The Surprisingly Chill Life of a Modern-Day Gladiator,"It's a breezy Sunday morning in April in the year MMXVI, and I'm late to meet the senator Tacitus at the Circus Maximus. I send him a text—mi dispiace!—a perhaps unnecessarily emphatic Italian apology I feel is nevertheless warranted. Since Tacitus sends me nothing in response, I assume he is angry and find myself panicked and hustling up the cobblestone roads. Rome is a strenuous city, hilly and dense and absent of modern conveyors such as sidewalks. Sweating, I wonder about the historical accumulation of several millennia of dopamine rushes, whether it's contributed to the architectural pomposity of the place.  Approaching the Circus Maximus, I hear the screech of a sound system getting set up, the thud mic checks, then the over-amplified whine of some ancient reed instrument. The day's events, free for anyone who's willing to take the hike, is something like a glorified and historically rigorous Ren faire. On the program is a morning procession around the Colosseum, dance performances, gladiatorial contests, and a slave-market reenactment. The procession hasn't started yet, but already there's a busy canvas of people milling about in costume: men and women dressed as legionnaires, gladiators, ribboned maidens, and noblemen. The gladiators, the apparent bad boys of the group, stand around smoking cigarettes and taking selfies, but it's their anachronistically pale white legs—hidden by modern man under pants—that seem most jarring.  Weaving through the crowd and dodging lethal-looking axes and leather whips, I find Tacitus at the far end of the track under a white tent where you can buy bottles of water, T-shirts, and event programs. Tacitus is the persona Paolo Zilli, 55, plays when he's not working as Metronius, a gladiator instructor at the gladiator school. He's altogether unlike what I'd expected from a modern-day gladiator, but my notions, admittedly, are informed primarily by the show American Gladiator, where souped-up contestants in Lycra pummel one another through various obstacles of foam. Zilli is actually pretty ordinary: just a respectably fit guy who happens to love history. This morning, Zilli, as Tacitus, is wearing a white robe lined with red velvet and flashy ancient bling: a heavy gold medallion and imperial wrist cuff. He strikes me as vaguely familiar. ""It's George Clooney,"" he offers eagerly. ""Everyone says I look like George. The only difference is our bank account."" When Zilli laughs, he really does look like Clooney—the smiling eyes, the leisurely Lake Como tan. And Zilli seems to luxuriate in inhabiting multiple famous personae at once—Tacitus, Metronius, Clooney-us. He looks at the recorder I've thrust into his hand with sincere befuddlement. ""We ancient Romans are not very good with technology,"" he quips.  Somewhere between an actor, amateur athlete, and armchair historian, Zilli's obsession with Roman history began at the age of nine, when he dressed as an ancient Roman for Carnevale, the Italian version of Halloween. His mom had sewn a tunic, and his dad had fashioned a sword with a wood shield. Since then, he's read hundreds of books on Roman history. But the former regional-level soccer player and black belt in karate says he only discovered this dream job, which combines physical exertion and historical nerdiness, only six years ago. ""When you fail as athlete, you have to recycle yourself,"" he says astutely.  Now he is one of the five gladiator instructors who teach at the school. His daily routine is structured around the tourist season, from April to October. During that period, he will spend up to eight hours at the gladiator school, teaching two-hour workshops to mostly American tourists for around $60 a pop. The rest of the year, he works as an English translator and interpreter.  Zilli assured me that his job is anomalous and ""fringe"" in Italy, as historical reenacting is considered gauche and politically incorrect, sort of like a ""cowboys and Indians"" festival would be in the US. ""Since we reenact the Roman Empire, they assume we are warmongers."" He laughs. ""Americans are the most curious. They are just admiring all of this. Even elderly people are jumping around and doing push-ups."" I ask if this is because America is a warmongering country, but he says it's because America is a new country, with barely 300 years of history. Instead, he shares another theory about national temperaments. ""I must pinpoint that the Australians are the most eager to fight. Especially women. They hit like men!"" He describes teaching a class where an Australian woman headbutted her friend so hard it broke her friend's nose. Blood gushed everywhere, but they appeared unfazed. ""She was doing this thing like King Kong, laughing. Unreal! Because if you think, Australia is the biggest jail of the universe, all the most dangerous prisoners were shipped to Australia. It must be in their DNA.""  Not a very politically correct thing to say, but Zilli loves to thrill and encapsulate contradiction. When I ask whether he watches Game of Thrones, he replies that he's more of a sci-fi guy. ""But that's in the future!"" I protest. ""Battlestar Galactica is like Roman Empire in the future,"" he replies. But whether he's living in the past, the present, or the future, he tries to live according to the ancient code called mos maiorum, or ""way of the elders.""  Later, I go to visit him at the school, which is located along the Appian Way, a military road built in 312 BC. The camp is quiet: weeds pouring from crumbling walls, the soothing swish of trees swaying overhead. The serenity is transporting. Zilli is giving a presentation to a group of teenage girls about the complexities of armor. He points at a metal crotch plate on the armored mannequin.  ""It's not used for protection,"" he explains. ""If you need it, it's already too late."" (The plates are used for percussive effect while marching.) Then he points to the red cloth underneath the armor. ""Why red? Anyone know? Because if you get stabbed, it will be the same color.""  With this same tone of blunt pragmatism, Zilli circulates the ""museum""—a small room filled with various instruments to inflict physical injury: catapults, crude clubs, crossbows, wood balls driven with metal spikes that look like sea urchins—and doles out nuggets of information. Garlic was used as an anticoagulant. Non-professional gladiators had to survive 30 matches to win their freedom. Female gladiators often fought dwarves and were used as clowns in comedic acts between the real fights. A lighthearted intermission, something like the halftime show.  Soon it's time for the girls go out and run circles around the sand pit. They have to jump back and forth over a low rope, leap over a bench, do a somersault, and then snake through swinging sandbags. (Some girls, miscalculating, get cruelly socked in the head.) After the warm-ups, Zilli brings out the wooden swords. He instructs them on the ""five basic moves"" of defense and offense, guiding them through each sword and foot position. It's all giggles in this arena, but from across the way, we can hear another, more vengeful training session going on. The instructor is shouting: ""Neck! Neck! Neck! Other side! Other side!"" and then a bloodcurdling shriek before a clash of wood and metal. I hurry over to inspect the damage: It's a husband and wife match-up. Apparently (according to Zilli) it's common for couples on vacation to get carried away trying to kill each other. (What is gladiator school good for if not as an outlet for sublimated desires?)  ""Yes, I'm very happy,"" Zilli says when I ask him about whether he enjoys his day job. ""It's rewarding when people leave with their mouth like this""—he gestures the broad, ungladiatorial smile on his own face. ""It's priceless.""

212055,"Ben Lee and Ted From 'How I Met Your Mother' Have A Band, Unfortunately","Here are some proper nouns you probably haven't heard in a while: Ben Lee; How I Met Your Mother; Josh Radnor. Now, here's those proper nouns in a very unlikely sentence: Australian adult contemporary icon Ben Lee and How I Met Your Mother's Josh Radnor have a band together! Apparently Ben and Josh have known each other for twelve or thirteen years after meeting on the set of How I Met Your Mother, and kept in touch. Eventually, they started writing songs together. Beautiful, right? Mediocrity respect mediocrity! In an interview with Channel Nine's Today show captioned 'Epic Bromance,' Ben explains that their collaboration is like ""a marriage,"" while Josh looks on with a pained look on his face. Josh, probably very sad that his hit TV show is over, then contributes a meek ""We really didn't know what we were getting into."" Poor once-famous Josh. Radnor and Lee have been making music as ~ Radnor and Lee ~ for a while now: a quick YouTube search reveals a terrifying vortex of acoustic folk rock that probably would have been right at home on an episode of How I Met Your Mother. You're welcome to listen for yourself, but if you don't have the guts you can feel safe in knowing that it's generally the kind of music that one only really tolerates if in, like, a car park below a Gap store. When I was scrolling through the many, many Radnor and Lee videos an acoustic guitar riff started autoplaying and I thought 'Hey, this doesn't sound too bad,' but actually it was just Kylie Minogue's ""Dancing"" autoplaying in another window. At least some people are still making good music with acoustic guitars. If you'd like to see Radnor and Lee live and relive the acoustic pop glory days of 2005, you can find their tour dates here.

212801,Glitch Video Game Nightmares Can Be Beautiful [Music Video],"We don't exactly know what's going on in Sam Rolfes' music video for Amnesia Scanner's ""AS Chingy""—and he won't tell us. It looks like some sort of mind-destroying video game, or an alien invasion into our own brains. It feels like a video game with mechanics designed by a chipmunk on acid. Like that GIF of Donald Trump's sincerity meter malfunctioning. These impressions are as much due to Amnesia Scanner's spastic music style, which goes from danceable to incomprehensible and back at the drop of a pin-studded, sweat-soaked hat. ""'AS Chingy' is and remains gut-wrenching to listen to,"" Rolfes confesses to The Creators Project. AS dives headfirst into the mysterious Berlin producer duo trope, successfully creating a confusing yet intriguing vibe. Their website is all but incomprehensible and their AS EP is spread throughout hyperlinks accross the web. We know they've worked with the likes of Holly Herndon and Mykki Blanco, but not much else. ""The assorted Amnesia Scanner tracks that I manage to find littered around the web, hidden on cryptic pages, resonate with a very particular kind of psycho-digital neurosis in me,"" Rolfes continues. As such, he agreed to a gag order preventing him from saying too much about the process behind his video for ""AS Chingy."" Here's what he could tell us: ""This is a live recording of an Amnesia Scanner performance done a few weeks ago, capturing the slow and violent progression of a colossal music festival stage taking on the role of the performer. The performance was recorded and captured live, the recording team consisted of myself and one other manning the camera, deploying survival measures, and attempting to survive the ordeal. The choreography was more or less written in ulcers across my stomach lining. We also asked Rolfes how we're supposed to even feel after watching this thing. He responded, ""I'd feel petty dictating how people should respond to the performance, but if it hurts, then you're at least viewing it from as similar perspective as I did.""

215686,Second deputy dies after she was shot during fight with prisoner,"(Reuters) - A second Kansas sheriff’s deputy died on Saturday after being shot during a fight with a prisoner who was being taken from jail to court for a hearing in Kansas City, police said. Deputy Theresa King, 44, who was with Kansas City Kansas Police Department for 13 years, died a little after midnight local time at the University of Kansas Medical Center, the department said in a statement. Another deputy, Patrick Rohrer, was also killed during the incident, officials said. Rohrer, 35, had been with the department for seven years. The deputies were shot on Friday after a suspect overpowered at least one of them and perhaps took a weapon, said Major Kelli Bailiff of the Wyandotte Sheriff’s Department said during a press conference. The suspect was also shot and was being treated at the same hospital. Police have not identified the suspect. Bailiff said she was not sure whether the suspect was shot by one of the deputies or someone else who responded to the incident. Bailiff said the incident occurred in a “caged” area outside a courthouse and there was no danger to the community. Kansas Governor Jeff Colyer released a statement Friday saying he was deeply saddened to learn of the shooting and that he and his wife, Ruth, would be praying for the deputies and their families.

225960,Wicked W.I.T.C.H: The 60s Feminist Protestors Who Hexed Patriarchy,"In the coming months and years, various W.I.T.C.H. branches sprung up across the United States and as far away as Japan. Their targets included universities, beauty pageants, and Playboy Clubs. Anti-marriage leaflets distributed by W.I.T.C.H. featured the warning, ""Always a bride; never a person."" They protested wedding fairs, singing, ""here comes the slaves, off to their graves"" to the music of the traditional bridal march. At one such fair in Madison Square Garden, W.I.T.C.H. released 100 white mice into the crowd, leading the host of the event to quip, ""I think they're just a little teed off because nobody ever proposed to them."" Blending the then radical demands of the burgeoning women's liberation movement with the iconography of witches, W.I.T.C.H. was provocative, fun, and, as founding member Robin Morgan writes in the anthology Sisterhood is Powerful, ""unhierarchal [sic] to the point of anarchy."" Groups played around with the W.I.T.C.H. acronym to suit their needs, coming up with Women Interested in Toppling Commercial Holidays and Women Infuriated at Taking Care of Hoodlums, among others. Becoming a member of W.I.T.C.H. was straightforward. According to the group's 1968 manifesto, ""There is no joining W.I.T.C.H.. If you are a woman and dare to look within yourself, you are a witch."" ""W.I.T.C.H. drew on the role of women at the edge of society,"" Heather Booth tells me over the phone. Booth took part in Chicago W.I.T.C.H. actions and remains a trailblazing campaigner and organizer. ""It also referred to medieval times and to Salem. One way to reclaim to your identity in the face of oppression and to take the sting out of attacks that may be made on you is to take the word of opprobrium, of criticism, and say, ""OK, I'll own that"". In W.I.T.C.H., we used it as guerrilla theater."" While W.I.T.C.H. was serious about critiquing the twin evils of capitalism and patriarchy, they also knew how to enjoy themselves, as Booth recalls. ""It was fun. It was a little bit anonymous because we all dressed in similar witch-like costumes. Some put makeup on their faces so you couldn't tell who they were. Afterwards, you just returned to your normal life."" ""When we heard about the New York action in Chicago we created our own W.I.T.C.H. group. There were several actions that we ended up doing. One was at the Chicago Board of Trade. We did another one at the American Medical Association annual conference and one at the University of Chicago. I remember part of that hex: 'Knowledge is power, through which you control our mind, our spirit, our body, our soul—HEX! And then we'd run onto the stage and people would say, 'What was that?'"" Booth notes that many activists who took part in W.I.T.C.H. were also active in other feminist causes. She herself was the originator of Jane Collective, a large Chicago-based underground service that provided 11,000 abortions in the years 1969 to 1973, prior to Roe v. Wade. While the emblem of the witch was a key part of W.I.T.C.H. actions, witchcraft itself was not necessarily practiced. ""There were some who took a more serious study of witches,"" Booth explains. ""They learned the chants and the history of the witches and how badly they were treated by society. They were dancing by the moon, looking to lead a more natural existence. They perhaps met once a week, whereas for us, it was a more ad hoc approach."" I ask Booth about people's reactions to W.I.T.C.H.. ""For people who were part of it, it was funny, exciting; it was building sisterhood. We were bonding together. It was a little scary, you know, to take this action. We didn't know what would happen, we were learning together."" ""For people who were the target, I imagine it was both confusing and somewhat annoying because it was a short term disruption of whatever they were doing—a change in focus. For people who were around it, I imagine their reactions started a conversation. There were some actions we did where now I might ask, 'How does this help us recruit? Did it build support or increase opposition?' I'd still do it again but I think we might add additional strategic concerns."" Laura X is a renowned social justice campaigner who was a driving force in the second wave fight to outlaw marital rape. She took part in Red W.I.T.C.H., a socialist spin-off of W.I.T.C.H. which was created by teaching staff at UC Berkeley who had spent time in Chicago and witnessed the W.I.T.C.H. actions there. ""Women's liberationists were definitely anti-capitalist,"" Laura tells me on the phone from her hometown of St Louis, where the Laura X World Institute for the Legacy and Learning of Social Justice Movements is based. ""Many of us had been in some kind of socialist organization earlier in the 60s. Some of us still were, some of us were driven out by—this the politest way I can put it—he contradictions between the ideals of radical males and their behavior,which was unconscionable [and] in some cases as horrible as Trump. I remember at one anti-war meeting, a woman got up to speak and some guy who was a major leader shouted, ""Take her off the stage and fuck her."" W.I.T.C.H. organizations were very much speaking to that kind of male entitlement."" Although W.I.T.C.H. is often seen as a fringe movement, their legacy endures. Earlier this year in Chicago, a performance collective of young women calling themselves WITCH in honor of their foremothers held a ritual protest against gentrification and the erosion of local housing rights. It is the kind of collective action both Booth and Laura X emphasize when I ask what made second wave activism like W.I.T.C.H. so important and so powerful. ""The most important thing is to organize with other women into consciousness raising groups, into action groups, but be as careful as possible not to be isolated because these times, like those times, are quite maddening,"" Laura X says. ""It was so much fun to do something with your anger and to illuminate what was wrong with a particular institution that we were outside yelling about. And how much fun it was to be saying out loud what we believed and to do it very creatively."" Booth notes that the of action W.I.T.C.H. favoured is still very present in the form of flash mobs and modern day performance protests. ""I'm not saying any of these people think about W.I.T.C.H. as they do this, but it is the same tradition of hit-and-run-visibility that's funny, serious, engaging, memorable, and has an impact on a broader audience and has an impact on the people who are involved in it. Because one of the main things is that the women's movement changed us. We changed from traditional roles, from being in the background, not being so visible, not taking risks, not challenging traditional conventions, to taking action, taking risks, and standing up for what we believed in.""",3.5
226993,"Twitter looks to toughen rules on online harassment, abuse","(Reuters) - Twitter Inc plans to toughen its rules on online sexual harassment and impose stronger penalties for misconduct, according to an email it sent to a group of safety advocates, academics and researchers that helps the social media service set its policies. The new rules, which will likely be introduced in the next few weeks, are aimed at tackling one of Twitter’s biggest and long-lasting problems. They follow a series of tweets by Chief Executive Jack Dorsey on Friday announcing plans to act more aggressively to limit the number of bullies and harassers using Twitter. The new guidelines include immediate and permanent suspensions of any account Twitter identifies as the original poster or source of non-consensual nudity. The site’s definition of non-consensual nudity will also be expanded to include what it called “upskirt imagery, creep shots and hidden camera content.” The rules were set out in a letter, which was seen by Reuters, to Twitter’s Trust and Safety Council from Twitter’s head of safety policy. The micro-blogging platform is also looking to allow bystanders to report unwanted sexual advances, which previously had to be reported by users directly involved in the situation. It also promised to publish more details on a change in policy which would include hate symbols and imagery in its definition of sensitive media. Dorsey’s pledge to revamp Twitter’s guidelines came after some users boycotted the service for suspending actress Rose McGowan, who spoke out against Harvey Weinstein, the producer who faces allegations that he sexually harassed or assaulted a number of women over three decades in the film business. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Twitter also faces scrutiny from lawmakers investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Last week, Twitter gave Senate investigators the profile names of 201 accounts it had determined were linked to an effort by Moscow to sow discord and divisiveness during and after the campaign, according to a source familiar with the matter. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee investigating Russian interference, previously called Twitter’s cooperation as “frankly inadequate.” Reporting by Angela Moon in New York and Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Dustin Volz in Washington DC; editing by Patrick Graham",4.0

228787,The Guide to Getting into Chic," Because their days as studio artists forced them to be chameleons, Rodgers and Edwards knew what it took to bringing talent together both in the studio and on stage. They recruited Tony Thompson—from the groups Labelle and Ecstasy, Passion & Pain—as Chic’s drummer. From there they brought on a young promising vocalist named Norma Jean Wright, sweetening the deal by also working together on her solo music, which would later score the pair an early hit as producers on the 1978 dancefloor smash “Saturday.” They even recruited a background vocalist and budding songwriter by the name of Luther Vandross to sing on their debut album. Another wise move. Soon Chic stormed the scene with infectious tracks with calls-to-action built into their terse titles—like “Everybody Dance” and the ingeniously straight forward anthem “Dance, Dance, Dance.” But around the same time, disco writ large—which was predominantly producer-driven and dependent on DJs for breaking hits—was becoming overwhelmed by overproduced sounds and cheesy whitewashed glam that would fuel its eventual demise, the story of every genre once the money gets involved. Chic, however, had a different vision: Rodgers and Edwards reimagined the disco’s inherent excess by whittling down the style to funky, minimalist grooves that managed to be both organic and deeply danceable. Rodgers’ snakey riffs squirmed up your bell-bottoms, burying themselves in your soft parts, and Edwards’ basslines provided a warm and addictive tempo that created a framework that would be recycled throughout the ensuing decades of popular music. The band’s rhythmic string sections and simple yet sneakily meaningful lyrics resulted in an approachable yet powerful sound that managed to feel like a raucous rock show and shiny disco dance party at the same damn time. They also had a penchant for classy—suits for the guys; tasteful dresses and rompers for the ladies—on-stage outfits that established their glittery sound and charming personalities as a symbiotic entity. Like many from the chapters of disco’s history, changes in taste and a souring of public opinion (thanks Chicago) would eventually leads to Chic’s disappearance from the music charts following the release of their third album in 1979. There were also years of drug addiction to make matters worse. But while swarms from the scene would spiral down into a wormhole of overplayed hits, cocaine, and recycled ideas, Chic’s Rodgers and Edwards managed to keep the fire burning (disco pun, sorry!) through groundbreaking work as producer and songwriters. Through multiple lineups they continued to release albums until the early 90s; and Rodgers and Edwards were responsible for many of modern’s music most profound moments as producers and songwriters—working with everyone from Diana Ross, to in Rodgers’ case, Daft Punk. Even before Rodgers was lending his guitar chops to the work of producers in the dance music space—and more specifically the EDM era—he an Edwards were both a key instigators to the birth of house music and club culture through their bass-heavy, rhythmic songs that were created with the dancefloor in mind. From their many hit Chic singles, to Rodgers’ work with Madonna and David Bowie, they helped usher in a time where 12” extended dance remixes set the scene for a rising popularity in DJs and popularized nightlife spaces that would incubate house and techno music over the years. The dance-inducing mania of their work opened the doors for sleek and funky instrumentation of disco-sampling dance genres like Chicago house, and later, French touch. There’s also the countless remixes of their work by seminal dance music luminaries, like Masters at Work, that kept their dancefloor relevance in check for years. While Edwards passed away in 1996 at the age of 43 to pneumonia, his longtime confidant Nile Rodgers is still doing his thing in 2018 and remains one of music’s most celebrated minds. He’s even playing at Coachella this weekend as Chic feat. Nile Rodgers. You’ve seen Shrek 2, so you’ve heard the big hits, but where do you start next with a band that defined the sound of a generation? Let’s break it down. This is the Chic you know, the Chic your parents definitely know, the Chic you’ve heard in Walgreens, while buying toothpaste. The story goes that Nile Rodgers was inspired by the winking glam of groups like Roxy Music and Kiss, while deciding what Chic would not only sound like, but look and feel like. A 1979 profile by Rolling Stone went as far as to refer to them as the “Boston of the Disco world.” Thankfully, they were, and remain, far cooler than Boston. Chic’s debut album, which was actually a demo tape, was signed to Atlantic in 1977 and would score the band some of their first and most historic hits in “Dance Dance Dance (Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah)” and the equally groove-inducing “Everybody Dance.” Both of the tracks would break the Billboard Top 10 chart at the time—they also featured a young Vandross on backing vocals, a catalyst to his future career as a superstar. Led by their tight, yet effortless grooves, skyrocketing string sections, and psychedelic chirps and lyrics (including nerdy American jazz references), their early hits offered an organic respite to the mainstream madness over the success of the film Saturday Night Fever and whitewashing of disco. The band’s sophomore album, 1978’s C'est Chic, managed to up the ante with two more hits: the woozy sex jam “I Want Your Love” and “Le Freak,” the group’s most successful track ever. The latter was written, as Rodgers told The Connecticut Forum in a panel from 2016, as an anthem for those who get turned away at the club doors, after their failure to get into Studio 54, on a night they were invited by, uh, Grace Jones, who apparently forgot to notify the door guy, The original lyrics were thus “Fuck off!”, which is what the door guys instructed them to do, but later were changed to “Freak out!” in an attempt to not piss off all the parents and label execs of America. Rooted by Rodgers’ absurdly funky rhythm guitar, Edward’s rubbery bassline, Tony Thompson's lazer-focused drum 120BPM beat, and Luci Martin and Alfa Anderson’s joyful hollering , “Le Freak” was Atlantic’s highest grossing track to date at the time, selling over 7 million copies worldwide, and is currently sitting pretty—and freaky—in the the Library of Congress. Music simply wouldn’t be the same without it. Following their second album, Chic’s third LP, Risque, the group would gift fans what was probably their last iconic hit: “Good Times,” though they’d go on to release five more disappointing albums. In August of 1979, the tune became Chic’s second number one single on the pop and soul charts. What it’s known and remembered most for, however, is Edwards’ smooth and syrupy bassline, which would become one of the most sampled—and stolen—sounds in popular music. It helped usher in hip-hop via Grandmaster Flash and the Sugarhill Gang; it was the inspiration of Queen’s “Another One Bites the Dust”; and Daft Punk famously sampled it for their global craze of a track “Around the World,” a track rooted by its elastic bassline. There’s probably someone sampling it now, as I write this.

One of their first wins was in Norma Jean Wright, who they roped into the Chic circle by offering her the chance to have a solo career that they, of course, would help produce. That resulted in not only Wright’s diva breakout and all-time weekend anthem “Saturday,” but the trio’s work on the Chic-produced Sister Sledge album and single “We Are Family,” another enduring hit of not only disco but pop overall. Edward and Rogers would also gift the track “He’s the Greatest Dancer” to Sledge in trade for their use of “I Want Your Love” for Chic, a clever strategy that would birth them yet another win. Follow their productive late 70s period, Rodgers and Edwards, who knew disco’s glam era was dissolving, started working with vocalists who had their sights set on the world of mainstream pop, both separately and as a team. You might want to sit down now. They worked on Diana Ross 1980 album Diana, which included the top-ten hit “I’m Coming Out” as well as the number one “Upside Down.” Listen to the first moments of “Upside Down,” with Rodger’s classic chucking guitar licks, the lush strings, even the lyrics, a simple homage to heartbreak built inside something of an instructional dance routine, and you’ll hear its pure and utter Chic-ness. The album would go on to be Ross’ most commercially successful album and would sell nine million copies worldwide. The duo helped usher in a new sound for Carly Simon on 1982’s “Why; they produced Debby Harry’s debut solo album Kookoo; and between 1983 and 1984, Rodgers produced both David Bowie’s Grammy-winning Let’s Dance and Madonna’s second album Like a Virgin. On Madonna's LP, Rodgers brought in Edwards on bass, and Chic’s Tony Thompson on drums, in many ways helping fuel her success via Chic’s veteran skills from their time as a backing band. The hysteria-including single “Like a Virgin,” produced by Rodgers, is a dance track to its very core, revolving around a steady drum beat and pulsating bassline—another style made famous by Chic. On “Let’s Dance,” another biblical call to the dancefloor, Rodgers and his regular collaborator Bob Clearmountain took what was originally said to be a folk song and stripped it down to a gloriously simple, shiny, punchy joyride full of descending basslines and that made you move. Rodgers also produced Mick Jagger’s She’s the Boss, while Edwards found some brief solo producer-success with the short lived group the Power Station alongside Chic’s Tony Thompson and Robert Palmer. Later on he’d produce Palmer’s own successful solo album Riptide. Playlist: “We Are Family”/ “Saturday”/ I’m Coming Out”/ “Upside Down” / “Upside Down”/ Let’s Dance”/ “Like a Virgin”/ “Why”/ “He’s The Greatest Dance” / “When Luther Sings”/ Never Too Much”/ “Riptide”/ “Some Like It Hot"" Spotify | Apple Music With the golden era of disco in their rear view, Chic’s marquee era as a band started to fade following their third album Risque and the success of “Good Times.” Being as astute businessmen as they were producers, Rodgers and Edwards chose to focus mainly on their outside work, and gaining the respect of artists and fans in the pop and rock genre. Still, they pumped out four more albums on Atlantic: 1980’s Real People, 1981’s Take it Off, 1982’s cheekily-titled Tongue in Chic, and last, and probably least, 1983’s Believer. Like their past albums, the various discs include a variety of Rodger’s springy guitar licks, Edward’s creative and effective basslines, and a variety of talented vocalists—from the disco diva Jocelyn Brown to Chic’s original Alfa Anderson. You’ll also hear some of the duo’s curious forays into other sounds that slightly latched onto the DNA of their original success while experimenting with genres like quiet storm and straight up R&B. Throughout this period of albums the group found it difficult to craft simple lyrical mantras and the kind of musical bliss that simply forced people to move—surely not helped by the fact that the mainstream excitement for disco was dead. They experimented with simplifying the Chic-recipe, toying with instrumental solos that often fell flat. The usual organicness of the sound moved dangerously towards overproduction on their comeback album Chic-ism. Their penchant for slipping in lyrics about love and dancing also over the years started to feel more like repetition versus innovation. After the disappointing performance of 1983’s Believer, Rodgers and Edwards would disband Chic to solely focus on their solo and collaborative production process. Fast forward to 1992, and the duo would bring reunite Chic with a new lineup and album entitled Chic-ism. While the album included some decent grooves and amusing play-on-words track titles, it didn’t do much besides allow the group to embark on a new exciting and well-received world tour. Edwards would sadly pass away a few years later to pneumonia. Playlist: “Rebels We Are”/ “Stage Fright”/ “Hangin”/ “I Feel Your Love Comin’ On”/ “Believer”/ “Party Everybody”/ Give Me The Lovin’/ “Chic Mystique"" Spotify | Apple Music Following Chic’s reunion tour and the death of Bernard Edwards, Nile Rodgers went on to continue his legacy as one of music’s most celebrated minds and is still doing his thing today. While he recorded three solo albums between the late 80s and early 90s, most will turn to his legendary work as a solo producer when discussing his last couple of decades. From INXS, to Duran Duran, to loveable orchestral soundtracks like Coming to America, work for Eric Clapton, Avicii, and of course in 2013, his Grammy-Winning work on Daft Punk’s mania-inducing Random Access Memories, he’s lent his mind and chucking guitar rhythms to modern music as one of the most talented produces of all time. He even co-wrote “Love Me Sexy” from the classic film Semi-Pro with famous actor Will Ferrell. Across his influential work as a solo producer, Rodgers would constantly use his penchant for simple yet effective rhythms to create joyful hits. There’s a grooving tempo and uplifting atmosphere to his work over these years, like on the whirling instrumentation and effects of Duran Duran’s 1984 hit “The Reflex” and the springy levitation of INXS’ “Original Sin,” as well as of course, “Get Lucky.” You don’t only hear Rodgers’ focus and seasoned musicianship on these hits, but also his open-ear that allowed him to trickle his talent into a variety of musical minds and scenes that like most of us, just wanna have fun. Somehow, through dozens of compilation discs, reunion shows, award show performances, and series of cool hats and even cooler sunglasses, Nile Rodgers has continued to influence artists and find ways to remain relevant. He’s managed to sneak into the EDM world with guitar work alongside producers like Tensnake and the formally relevant Avicii; he played as part of the best Grammy performance ever with Daft Punk and Stevie Wonder; he’s been inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; started multiple foundations and benefit concerts; and even relaunched Chic as a live band as Chic feat. Nile Rodgers and is currently touring. He’s done it all while battling everything from crippling drug addiction to prostate and kidney cancer, and usually with a wide smile on his face. He’s currently gearing up to launch a new solo album, his first since 1992. The world is better with Nile Rodgers in it plain and simple Here is some more good times to chew on in the playlist below.

230110,South Korea steps up effort to get U.S. help in export row with Japan,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea has warned the United States of the potential damage from “undesirable” Japanese restrictions on exports of high-tech material to South Korea, as a trade row between the East Asian U.S. allies intensifies. As South Korea sought U.S. help in the dispute, triggered by disagreement over the issue of compensation for South Koreans forced to work for Japanese firms during World War Two, it also took steps to limit the damage to its companies. South Korea’s ruling party announced that up to 300 billion won ($255 million) would be included in a supplementary budget to cope with Japan’s curbs on exports of three materials, crucial for advanced consumer electronics, by speeding localization of their supply. The ruling Democratic Party said about one-third of the proposed budget would be for supporting South Korean materials and equipment makers to help them get their products to market. The East Asian neighbors share a bitter history dating to Japan’s colonization of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945. Relations took a turn for the worse this week when Japan said it would tighten curbs on exports of the materials used to make chips and display panels because trust with South Korea had been broken over the forced labor dispute. S&P Global Rating’s Asia-Pacific chief economist Shaun Roache said the dispute was as unpredictable as the U.S.-China trade war and was likely to affect South Korea’s growth. The Japanese restrictions will affect companies such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS), which supply chips to companies such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O). U.S.-SOUTH KOREAN CALL South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a phone call late on Wednesday that Japan’s restrictions may not only damage South Korean companies, but could also disrupt the global supply chain and hurt U.S. firms. Kang “expressed concern that this is undesirable in terms of friendly relations between South Korea and Japan and trilateral cooperation among South Korea, the U.S. and Japan,” Kang’s ministry said in a statement. South Korea hoped Japan would withdraw the curbs and that the situation would not deteriorate further, it said. Pompeo said he understood and they both agreed to strengthen communication between the three sides, it said. The State Department said the two reaffirmed their commitment to the final, fully verified denuclearisation of North Korea and the importance of trilateral cooperation between the United States, Japan and South Korea. It said the U.S.-South Korean alliance “remains the linchpin of peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in the region.” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said Washington’s ties with Japan and South Korea were some of the closest it had in the world and it would do everything it could to strengthen the relationships “between and amongst all three countries.” However, analysts say that while Washington is unhappy with the South Korea-Japan dispute, which also saw the countries clash at the World Trade Organization (WTO) this week, it is unlikely to become a mediator. Kim Hyun-chong, deputy chief of South Korea’s National Security Office, arrived in Washington on Wednesday and told reporters he would meet officials from the White House and Congress to discuss issues that included Japan’s export curbs. A former Japanese ambassador to the United States, Ichiro Fujisaki, questioned the need for U.S. mediation. “I don’t think we need the United States to mediate, just like Japan would not mediate U.S.-Mexico ties or U.S.-Canada relations,” Fujisaki told Reuters on Wednesday. “This is an issue to be solved between Japan and South Korea.” Japan’s export restrictions follow its frustration over what it sees as South Korea’s failure to act in response to a ruling by one of its courts last October ordering Japan’s Nippon Steel Corp (5401.T) to compensate former forced laborers. Japan says the issue of forced labor was fully settled in 1965 when the neighbors restored diplomatic relations. New U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs David Stilwell arrived in Japan on Thursday on the first stop of a 10-day visit to Asia. He is also scheduled to visit South Korea next week, but he did not mention the dispute when he spoke to reporters. Sheila Smith, senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said it may be too early for Stilwell to assess what the United States could do to help. “He is likely to begin with what I would call deep listening,” she said. Shares in major South Korean chip companies rose for a third day on Thursday on expectations that the Japanese export curbs may ease a supply glut of South Korean memory chips. Samsung Electronics shares ended 1.4% higher and SK Hynix was up 3.6%, outperforming the broader market's .KS11 1.1% rise.

233069,Rule-Breaking Particles May Exist Near the Earth's Core," Every once in a while, we hear about the horrifying creatures that have been discovered in the deep ocean, which has managed to cement the idea that the deep oceans are the most mysterious, unexplored regions on earth. Let us propose a more mysterious, completely unexplored region: the core and mantle of the earth. According to research published in Nature on Thursday, the mantle may be home to liquids that defy known rules of chemistry because of the extreme temperatures and pressure exposed to materials in the region. Per twentieth-century chemist Linus Pauling's third rule of crystal structures, crystals are more unstable when anions (negatively-charged ions) connect with one another by their “faces,” or long sides. He reasoned that anions would want to be as far away from positively-charged cations as possible, meaning that connecting anions by their points is a stable arrangement. But at extreme temperatures and high amounts of pressure, these researchers proved, this rule is flipped upside down. In fact, eight-sided liquid silicates—molecules of silicon and oxygen that make up most of the earth’s mantle—can arrange themselves such that multiple faces directly connect with each other. This research could be used to unlock the the chemical evolution of the earth, molecule by molecule. “Modelling of processes involving deep Earth liquids requires information on their structures and compression mechanisms,” the paper reads. “Knowledge on physical and chemical properties of the melts 45 is important for understanding evolution of the deep Earth interiors. The formation, circulation, and movement of solid and liquid rocks is the one of the biggest forces driving change of earth’s surface conditions. The liquids churning deep below the surface build the earth’s atmosphere, as well as its magnetic sphere, which influences earth’s distribution of gravity and powers human telecommunications. The researchers used used single-crystal X-ray diffraction diamond anvil cells, which captures the intricate, microscopic structures of crystals. Using those X-ray results, the researchers used computer modeling to simulate to the arrangement of silicate molecules under different amounts of pressure and temperature. Since we can’t actually visit the mantle or core of the earth, computer modeling is necessary in order to understand the composition of particles in the regions. Scientists have proposed that liquid silicates compress in strange ways under godly amounts of pressure, but prior to now, this face-sharing arrangement of silicates has never been modeled. The core and mantle of the earth is a growing area of interest for scientists around the world. Earlier this month, researchers from Spain used data from Antarctica’s IceCube observatory in order to link neutrinos—small, difficult-to-detect that are abundant throughout the universe—with the weight and composition of the earth’s inner layers. Obviously, it would be great to be able to be able to take a tram down to the core and mantle of the earth and gather first-hand silicate data. But if you’ve read or seen Journey to the Center of the Earth, you know that’s a bad (and also impossible) idea, and modeling research like this is the best alternative to the real thing.",3.0

252017,These Innovative Students Explore Photography's Break with Reality,"Students within the MA Photography course at Central Saint Martins (CSM), discuss philosophy instead of traditional photographic techniques and produce work questioning notions about imagery and its contemporary use. In today’s selfie era, where social media and smartphones have made images widespread, contemporary photography struggles to define itself. The transition from traditional film to digital production have seen images become a mass communication tool. Dr. Daniel Rubinstein, the photography course leader at CSM, believes that the new technologies and distribution of images provide new artistic liberties. He tells The Creators Project,“I think there’s currently a massive disconnect between what you see in a photography exhibition and all the ways in which photography is used in everyday life. This morning I used Snapchat, I saw photographs on Twitter and I posted some photos. I think the way we use photography like this and how it frames our experiences are not getting reflected in the way that photography is exhibited and shown. We communicate with photography on so many levels.” “Photography never arrived at that moment of freedom from depicting reality in various ways,” says Rubinstein. “But now that the image is increasingly produced by digital means, photography can explore much more than its own internal aesthetics.”   Whether through Skype or captured by drone, sharing images is a cultural activity and visual language containing vast amounts of data when broken down from its digital form. In an online environment, an image is simply code, converted into a picture when placed in our physical surroundings. Since its beginnings, photography has been a medium predominantly for documentation, providing a window into the world or representation of something in it. Used as a tool in art, science and beyond, photography has proven to influence artistic practices, helping give birth to movements such as Impressionism with its ability to capture lighting in real time. Art too, has had an influence on photographic practice. Fine art photography, like Diane Arbus and the Snapshot aesthetic, can be demonstrative of Modernist or Abstract painting, a time when artists began questioning the act of painting, moving away from creating portraits and landscapes so prominent in the Enlightenment period.   “Rather than being a picture of something that happens in the world, photography is what happens,” explains Rubinstein. “It is the event, not the picture of something. What the CSM students are trying to do is slow down and explore the complexities of that, releasing photography from this responsibility of representing things and reflecting on them culturally, politically, and socially.” Will Webster enlarged a photograph to make a 1p (about 33 cents) price tag to hang in the CSM building and sold it for 1p. Samantha Harvey, another student, created a network of raw films, exploring internal emotions by putting them on screen in a physical space for viewers to interact with. While traditional photography—fine art or reportage—remains a critical player in the world of art, new ways of subverting society’s practice of Instagram, Snapchat or Skype, will certainly be something to look out for. “The students really make a claim that photography is an art form, perhaps for the first time,” says Rubinstein. “They are kind of reimagining and reinvesting photography with its own materiality. To me, artists seem the best placed people to interrogate the various aspects of this online offline environment.” Dr Daniel Rubinstein is the editor of the photographic journal The Philosophy of Photography.

258398,"Devers homers twice, Red Sox rout O's in DH opener","EditorsNote: Tweaks headline, edits throughout story Rafael Devers hit a pair of home runs with six RBIs, and Xander Bogaerts drove in four runs to reach the 100-RBI mark as the Boston Red Sox added to their franchise-best victory total Wednesday with a 19-3 rout over the visiting Baltimore Orioles in the first game of a day-night doubleheader. The game was scheduled after Tuesday night’s contest was rained out. Five of the Red Sox’s 22 hits were home runs, including one for Bogaerts and one for J.D. Martinez, whose 42nd of the season also gave the Red Sox their 200th on the year. Boston hit 168 home runs last season. Martinez is now tied with Dick Stuart (1963) for most home runs in a debut season with the Red Sox. Devers has 21 home runs while Bogaerts hit his 22nd. Blake Swihart added a homer, his third. Mookie Betts joined Jacoby Ellsbury (2011) as the only players in Red Sox history with a 30-homer, 30-steal season when he swiped second base in the second inning. The Red Sox (107-51) became just the 15th team to win at least 107 games, and the first since the 2001 Seattle Mariners won 116. The Orioles (45-112) tied the 1952 Pittsburgh Pirates for the sixth-most losses in the modern era. The Red Sox took control in the opening inning with a two-run double from Bogaerts and a three-run double from Devers. The Orioles hit two second-inning home runs, getting a solo shot from Trey Mancini, his 24th, and a two-run shot from Renato Nunez, his eighth. Baltimore then loaded the bases on a single and two walks with one out before Red Sox starter David Price escaped that jam. Price (16-7) gave up three runs on six hits over five innings with three walks and six strikeouts. The Red Sox also had nine doubles, by nine different players, to increase their major-league-leading total to 344. Devers had four hits while Martinez and Andrew Benintendi had three each. Betts reached base three times. In his first career start and 17th career appearance, Orioles right-hander Ryan Meisinger (2-1) recorded just one out, giving up five runs on four hits with a walk. It was his first career loss. —Field Level Media",3.5

259890,Rare Strain of Drug-Resistant Gonorrhea Found in North America,"To the list of worries in the world—global warming, a president trying to sabotage American healthcare, bears—you can now add drug-resistant gonorrhea. A strain of the bacteria that’s resistant to a key antibiotic, ceftriaxone, has emerged in Quebec. It’s the first time such a strain has been found in North America. The standard treatment for gonorrhea includes two antibiotics. One, ceftriaxone, is administered via an injection and the second, azithromycin, is delivered as a pill. This one-two punch should knock out most infections for most people. But it’s also the last of the easy cures for gonorrhea, which has barreled through the repertoire of available treatments—in fact, gonorrhea used to be treatable with a single pill. Drug companies are working on new solutions, but we’re running low on options until those arrive. So yeah, it’s a problem. The clap might sound like a punchline from a 1970’s teen comedy, but there were nearly 469,000 cases were diagnosed in the United States last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The rate of infection is the highest it’s been in decades, and the CDC lists the gonorrhea bacteria among three “urgent hazards” of public health. Untreated gonorrhea can lead to scarring of the urethra in men and pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility in women. Watch More from Tonic: Meanwhile, treatment-resistant strains have appeared in Japan, Europe, and, last fall, in Hawaii. The strain in Hawaii wasn’t fully resistant; while it didn’t respond to azithromycin, it was treatable with ceftriaxone. Azithromycin has proven to be the weaker part of the one-two treatment, and resistance to it has been rising. Doctors in Hawaii, though, saw signs of developing resistance to ceftriaxone and warned that we’re getting closer to a time when gonorrhea may be untreatable with current meds. Which brings us to the current case. A 23-year-old woman in Quebec tested positive for gonorrhea during an STI screening; she had no symptoms. Test results showed that she was infected with a strain of the bacteria genetically similar to the resistant type found in Japan. Her most recent boyfriend had previously traveled to China and Thailand and had unprotected sex there, which suggests the strain may be spreading. The case was outlined in Emerging Infectious Diseases, a CDC journal. Her case proved resistant to ceftriaxone, though luckily it was cured with azithromycin. But again, increasingly, we can't count on that one. That means that the last of our two easy-to-use weapons against gonorrhea may be faltering—first azithromycin, now ceftriaxone. “This worries me. It worries me because we haven’t seen the ceftriaxone decreased susceptibility at this level,” Alan Katz, who is with Hawaii’s state board of health and studied the antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea found there last year, told STAT News. The trajectory is grim: Gonorrhea rates are way up and the bacteria keeps developing ways to thwart our best weapons. That means treatment is likely to grow more complicated, with higher dosages and more follow-ups, and even a return to older, harsher drugs that’d been shelved because of their nasty side effects. And it’ll mean acknowledging that gonorrhea is no joke, but an ongoing public health crisis. Read This Next: The Final Word on What You Can Catch From Oral Sex",2.5
263719,Explore Salvador Dalí's World in Virtual Reality," Fairly early in Salvador Dalí's career, between 1933 and 1935, he worked on a painting titled Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet's Angelus. A surreal interpretation of Jean-François Millet's painting The Angelus, it grew out of Dalí's fascination with a reproduction of the painting that that hung on a wall of his elementary school, where he invented stories of the peasant couple praying in the middle of a potato field. In his painting, Millet's couple are transformed into ancient, gigantic sculptural ruins in a barren landscape illuminated by the moon. Thanks to the Dalí Museum's Dreams of Dalí, visitors can now enter a fully immersive 360-degree virtual reality recreation of the painting. Viewers can enter the towers and float around Dalí's surrealist landscapes, and experience ""surprises"" that weren't found in the original painting. Viewers drift past a man and a child standing in awe of the sculptural ruins. While approaching the sculptures, viewers rise into the air to see the sand wave patterns below and the mountains in the distance. Dalí speaks in Spanish as if he is the voice of God. The viewer cannot totally control the experience, but are free to look in any direction they like. Those who can't make it to the Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida can experience and navigate Dreams of Dalí on Google Cardboard, with an Android phone, or on an iPhone via the YouTube app. And those on desktops or laptops are encouraged to view the latest version on Chrome. Click here to experience the 360-degree video. Dreams of Dali is on view as part of the current Disney and Dali: Architects of the Imagination exhibition at the Dalí Museum, which runs until June 2.

266695,"Tokyo 2020 must address questions, says IOC's Coates","TOKYO (Reuters) - John Coates, chairman of the IOC’s Coordination Committee for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, told organizers on Monday that stakeholders may lose confidence in their ability to host the Games if they do not answer questions about preparations. Speaking at the International Olympic Committee’s Project Review meeting in Tokyo, Coates said there would be no let-up from National Olympic Committees (NOCs) and international sporting federations in the run-up to the Games. “We enter a phase where questions from stakeholders become very pragmatic and very urgent,” said the Australian in his opening remarks ahead of the two-day meeting. “I wasn’t at SportAccord but I have read and I know that your delegation experienced this from the international federations that were there, with some very pertinent questions. “I say this as a friend: you can expect more of this.” Over 200 NOCs will visit Tokyo in November and Coates expected it to be a challenging time for organizers. “They are going to want answers and so you have to be prepared to answer these questions when they are raised. If you don’t, these are the sorts of things that can impact the confidence of our stakeholders in your ability to host the Games,” said Coates. “That is very hard to come back from, once that momentum starts to build.” The Project Review meeting comes following a decision made in December to update the projected budget for Tokyo 2020, involving a reduction of $1.4 billion in total costs. Games organizers have been working to slash costs after a study in 2016 warned that expenses could balloon to four times the initial estimate made in the bid process. The IOC is keen for Tokyo to set a good example by cutting costs in order to attract future candidate cities but Coates stressed that the second version of the budget was not solely about reducing costs. “It is not just about saving you money. It is about a more efficient delivery of the Games and utilizing the knowledge of your stakeholders. “I hope, and I will stress this many times, that you approach it from that aspect, not just saving money.” Tokyo 2020 President Yoshiro Mori reiterated during his opening remarks that “budget reduction is the highest priority” for organizers. Mori also spoke of his sadness at the passing of Katsunori Imai, who was the executive director for security on the organizing committee. Imai, a former Tokyo police director, died last week and Mori led officials in a moment of silence. The meeting concludes with a news conference on Tuesday. Editing by Peter Rutherford",3.0
278413,Facebook Yells “Sportsball!” – TechCrunch,"Facebook wasn’t built for sports. Its filtered, non-chronological News Feed made it tough to follow real-time chatter about the game. Twitter’s feed is great for it. But out of Facebook’s 1.55 billion users, there are a LOT of rabid sports fans who aren’t on Twitter. Facebook’s not actually trying to steal Twitter’s hardcore users as much as box it out of recruiting hundreds of millions more. That’s why Facebook built its newest feature, Facebook Stadium. It’s a part of its main app for following sports games where you can watch play-by-play news, read commentary from athletes and critics, and cheer with friends. Facebook needed to change its perception with sports fans, and it was too late to do that by subtly adding real-time chatter into the News Feed as it’s tried before. If you build it, maybe they’ll come. So Facebook erected Stadium as an explicit home for sports. It’ll be available to US iOS users for football games these next few weeks with more countries and sports to come. Until now, the social network’s own employees like Boz the ads boss used janky hacks to Facebook about sports. “#49ers Thread”, he’d post, and then comment on himself to add his color commentary. Otherwise, out of context, his short-lived reactions probably wouldn’t get enough Likes to be seen by many people. Still, it just didn’t fit right. Facebook already has a ton of sports chatter scattered across its feed. 65 million booed, cheered, and quipped about last year’s Super Bowl. But that was despite it feeling like each user was stuck in a noisy, crowded bar where they were the only one who cared about the game. The name of the new feature is meant to evoke being surrounded by fellow passionate fans. Twitter has Moments for following the highlights in a simple, lean-back format, and buried hubs for different sports leagues. And ESPN has a liveblog ticker of the action. But Facebook combines posts from athletes, pundits, and friends with a new idea that has tons of potential: making the play-by-play social. Thanks to a data service called Sportsradar, Stadium gives every play its own Facebook post. You can Like, comment on, or share each kick, pass, and score. That allows Facebook to not only be a second screen you watch alongside TV like Twitter. Facebook can be your first screen. With everyone Facebooking on the go, and many younger people not having cable or even a television, that’s a smart move. If Facebook wins sports chatter, it will surely attract the advertisers too. It’s easy to imagine sponsorships or ads within Stadium, just like its real-world equivalents. Advertisers love the idea of reaching a huge audience simultaneously — owning a moment. Stadium centralizes attention to offer that. An added benefit is that Stadium could keep sports content locked away from non-fans. A half decade ago, Facebook quarantined posts about social games like FarmVille, only showing them to those who played. The silos kept non-gamers from getting annoyed while making gamers feel less guilty about posting. Stadium is the evolution of the hashtag and the trending topic, two less overt ways to create a digital water cooler where everyone talks about whatever’s most important in the world. It’s easy to imagine Facebook going beyond sports and building Newsroom for following breaking news events, or Living Room for discussing TV shows. Then again, Facebook seems to take another crack at real-time each year. While the data might say it’s made plenty of forward progress, most still don’t think of it as where they go to read or post “HOLY CRAP HE CAUGHT IT!” As with almost every product, what will really matter is how and how much Facebook promotes the feature to people talking about sports. With Stadium, we’ll see if Facebook’s can paint itself in team colors and rally fans without scaring away those who couldn’t care less about sportsball.",3.0
280090,Retiring judge Strine calls on funds to protect U.S. workers,"WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - As chief justice of Delaware’s Supreme Court, Leo Strine has decided disputes affecting powerful U.S. companies and investors, but his departing thoughts were reserved for some unheralded participants in corporate America: workers. In an interview ahead of his retirement announcement on Monday, Strine urged large investment funds to pressure U.S. corporations to stop funding political causes and advocate for labor. “No one invests their money so that these corporations can spend it on politics. No one,” said Strine in an interview last week. “It’s unaccountable and it’s wrong.” Because the state is home to most publicly traded companies, the Delaware courts are the most influential judiciary in the United States for business law, and Strine spent two decades there as a judge, including the last five as chief justice. His influence has been far reaching. Strine, 55, did not disclose his post-retirement plans although he previously worked as a lawyer in private practice, taught at law schools and wrote scholarly legal articles. Wherever he lands, he is likely to continue to be an important voice in the law. During a rare major media interview in his Wilmington, Delaware office, Strine called upon big managers of 401(k) retirement account money such as Fidelity and Vanguard, who are frequently the biggest investors in major U.S. companies, to focus more on workers’ welfare. Vanguard and Fidelity declined to comment.    He said the big investment funds wrongly tolerate corporate political spending, which companies use to undermine federal worker protections and environmental laws. Strine said it would be an “evolutionary step” for companies to have a director protecting the interests of the workforce and he supported of Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren’s bill to expand corporate directors’ purview to include labor. The chief justice brushed aside criticism that Delaware court rulings have made it tougher for investors to bring cases challenging board decisions. Those rulings helped end a flood of shareholder class actions against merger deals. The suits produced fees for lawyers who brought the cases but rarely resulted in money for investors. Strine called the cases “an outrage against American stockholders and American workers.” He criticized using mandatory arbitration as a way to further reduce shareholder litigation, an idea that has gained ground in academic circles. Arbitration would deny companies and investors lengthy written opinions, a specialty of Delaware courts, that help improve corporate governance. “To relegate those kinds of things to an arbitration proceeding, in my view is fundamentally inconsistent with the historical promise of our corporate law. It is not our brand,” he said. Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; Editing by Cynthia Osterman",3.5
281082,Katy Perry and Benjamin Booker Have the Same Album Title,"Guys, Katy Perry (Twitter bio: ""Artist. Activist. Conscious."") is woke now, so you can all just deal with it okay? Katy Perry is so woke that she never sleeps. Even the title of her new album, ""Witness,"" announced on Monday, May 15, is woke. Except, the potency of that wokeness has kind of been diluted by the fact that it shares a name with the new record by the Southern US musician Benjamin Booker. Usually this wouldn't really be a big deal—plenty of acts have albums which share titles – but unfortunately it seems that Katy might well have been pipped in the woke stakes by Booker (though it feels unfair to use ""woke,"" a word that's now been hijacked to almost connote a performative, borderline competitive awareness of social justice, to talk about him). Alongside the March release of his album's title track, Booker wrote a thoughtful, lyrical essay about his identity as a black man in the US. At the end of his essay, Booker stated simply: ""Witness asks two questions I think every person in America needs to ask. 'Am I going to be a Witness?' and in today's world, 'Is that enough?'"" Conversely, Billboard reports that according to a release, Perry's album ""reflects on the changes in her own life and in the world around her, delivering songs that both challenge and inspire,"" which, comparatively, is just words really, isn't it? But, you know, #Witness! #Awareness, guys! But hey, at least it sounds as though Benjamin's ready to break bread over it. ""I wonder what her reasoning for her album title is,"" he told Billboard, ""and I wonder if… nah, she doesn't know who I am. That's impossible. But if she's out there and wants to reach out, we can have a nice chat about the title Witness.""

286164,"How American TV consumption is changing, in one chart","Streaming service subscribers (free or paid) increased again (68% in 2016 vs. 63% in 2014) and has caught up with the percentage of Paid TV service providers (67%) for the first time ever, according to the Consumer Technology Association's new study, The Changing Landscape for Video and Content. Data: Consumer Technology Association; Chart: Lazaro Gamio / Axios Why it matters: The rise of streaming services represents a shift in consumption habits towards cord-cutting, primarily amongst millennials. Cord-cutters are opting to ditch their bundled cable packages for more affordable, niche content services that can be accessed on TV box tops or on mobile.

The caveats: Lake admitted last week that he'd been misled by Rep. Devin Nunes on a story about Obama officials incidentally surveilling Trump, and controversial pro-Trump blogger Mike Cernovich was the first to report this news yesterday. What it means: The standard for unmasking is that information ""must have some foreign intelligence value,"" which is such a broad definition that it means Rice's requests were probably legal. What we do know: This new information does not validate Trump's wiretapping tweets as he specifically mentioned Obama administration surveillance of Trump Tower.

307282,Trump's mind-numbing media manipulation machine,"There is a very specific — and dangerous — formula for manipulating the media and hijacking the Twitter/cable/conventional media industrial complex. Trump sets this formulaic trap increasingly often. And news organizations keep falling for it. Step 1: Throw an early morning Twitter bomb, usually but not always timed to ""Fox & Friends"" fodder or reinforcement. The Tweet-bomb frequently hits ""fake news"" or some social topic with racial undertones. Within minutes, thousands of Trump's Twitter followers retweet it, and the sparks fly in response. Trump knows this and has bragged to staff about the storm he's stirring as he hits ""publish."" The data: As president, Trump has tweeted about fake news 124 times, mostly before 9 a.m., and his tweets about fake news average more retweets and likes. Step 2: The outrage machine kicks in. The first hour of ""Morning Joe"" is consumed by reaction to either that morning's or yesterday's tweet bomb. But the real action unfolds on Twitter, with scores of journalists and activists howling in protest. ""He exerts a deeper level of control simply through his ability to bait hostile media at will with his every seemingly nutty utterance,"" conservative columnist Bret Stephens smartly noted Thursday in the New York Times. Step 3: The cable beast awakens. MSNBC/CNN/Fox are basically 24/7 politics now, and the reporters who uncorked on Twitter sit alongside the hosts to dissect/condemn the Twitter bomb. They tweet the highlights. The rage builds. The cycle speeds. One result: ""A political opposition that is exhausting itself — and much of the public — with its perpetual state of moral apoplexy,"" Stephens writes. Step 4: The fringes foment. Breitbart belts out a stream of stories, usually supporting Trump or mocking cable hysteria on the left. It pumps its greatest hits through Facebook, where both sides game the algorithm to play to their team's emotional response. Twitter wars usually ensue. The data: Many of the most engaging politics and news pages on Facebook in October were hyper-partisan political pages, according to social analytics company NewsWhip, and the most popular reaction to them is the ""angry face"" emoji. Step 5: Opinions fly. By nighttime, MSNBC goes hard left, Fox hard right, peaking with their highest-rated champions (Maddow on the left and Hannity on the right) tucking like-minded people in with soothing stories of why they were so right today. The data: Hannity averages more than 3.1 million viewers a night over the last two months, and Maddow averaged 2.6 million. We go to bed, sleep poorly, wake up and do it again. ""How do we pay attention without paying him a kind of homage? Can we respond to his outrages without drowning in our own?"" Stephens concludes in his must-read column. Sound smart: We are all amplifying and participating in this endless sideshow. There is no easy solution, other than clinging to reality and clinically exposing Trump's make-believe. Check the facts, pay attention, but ignore the pure crap. Go Deeper: Exhausted by the Trump presidency? Brace yourself.

307384,This 1921 Proto-Meme Is Eerily Relevant Today,"Can people change? While everything seems like a garbage fire right now, humanity has improved through the ages, right? An unearthed copy of the University of Iowa's satirical magazine The Judge from 1921 suggests that, at least when it comes to comedy, some things never change. Behold what seems to be the first recorded use of the ""What You Think You Look Like vs. What You Actually Look Like"" meme. It also closely resembles the ""Expectation vs Reality"" meme that exploded after Marc Webb's 2009 film (500) Days of Summer used it to devastate Joseph Gordon-Levitt's misguided attempt to get back with his ex. The format has proliferated in the form of web comics, image macros, and YouTube videos and still sees healthy engagement on a dedicated subreddit. It turns out the format is nearly 100 years old, with some sources dating it back to an edition of the Wisconsin Octopus—a college rag similar to The Judge—from either 1919 or 1920. The comic shows that the meme may have really started well before the web. Some are even speculating that the comic may constitute the first meme as we now define them. The style of the illustration is so similar to some anime-inspired memes and the bad comic style introduced by artists like Robert Crumb in the 1960s that it almost feels like a hoax. However, a PDF of the original Judge issue digitized by Google suggests this proto-meme is legit. The comic is surrounded by poetry and jokes that are also eerily relevant to the problems of modern life. Women are besieged by pickup artists in most of the jokes, and one quip proves that flat earthers were already on their bullshit long before B.o.B adopted the cause and ""Mad"" Mike Hughes rocketed into the atmosphere.

317122,Look at These Photos of Happy People at New Brunswick's SappyFest 2016,"Coszmos Quartette. All photos by Kate Killet. In the small town of Sackville, New Brunswick, a little bit of swamp magic happened over the weekend as the much loved SappyFest took over. Sackville is a tiny East Coast place, mostly known as a university town, home to Mount Allison University. But since it’s founding in 2006, SappyFest has since grown to be Canada’s best kept artistic secret. Having now just completed its 11th year, SappyFest was initially founded by singer-songwriter Julie Doiron’s Sappy Records label, and it is now a registered non-profit organization. With no VIP area, no giant crowds or long lines, SappyFest is kind of the anti-festival festival. The arts and music festival has quickly become a haven for music nerds and kindhearted weirdos alike. The eclectic curation of talent local and abroad is always on point; having hosted past acts as Constantines, Destroyer, Grimes, Arcade Fire—who performed under the decoy name Shark Attack—and Angel Olsen. Every year the fest has a motto: pasts mottos include “Ambiguous At Best,” “Swamp Magic,” and “You Are Nowhere.” This year's motto? “IT’S LIT.” We spoke to bands, volunteers, festivalgoers, and others who make up the vast and welcoming Sappy community; asking the newbies about their first Sappy experience and the long time veterans about what keeps them coming back. See and feel the swamp magic below: Katie Monks of Dilly Dally. Festival performer. Toronto, Ontario. First SappyFest. ""People here say hello to you. Strangers! In Toronto, you don’t get that.

Second SappyFest. “It’s small. It’s not a huge music festival with 80,000 people. It’s more personable.”Kathleen of Milkweed at the zine fair. Toronto, Ontario. Sixth SappyFest. ""My faith in the curation and the community keeps me coming back.”Emmanue (left). Festivalgoer. Saint-Léonard, New Brunswick. Third SappyFest. “I love the music, the environment, and connecting with people. It’s this small little festival that no one knows about. We don’t want people to know about it. Don’t come! It’s affordable. There’s also more racialized performers coming and queer artists coming, before it wasn’t as diverse but now it’s starting to be and that’s dope.”She Devils. Sappy performers. Montreal, Quebec. First SappyFest. “Definitely our best show ever. People have said it’s like summer camp for musicians and I think that’s true.” Jeff. Festivalgoer. Sackville, New Brunswick. Ninth SappyFest. “Sackville is the center of the universe.”Michael Mandele. Sackville, New Brunswick. Seventh SappyFest. “It brings a lot of people here who wouldn’t normally know that Sackville exists. It’s great. I grew up here and wouldn’t have wanted to grow up anywhere else. Ben. A Bartender at local venue and bowling alley, Thunder and Lightning. Sackville, New Brunswick. Eleventh SappyFest. “They’ve had wrestling and they’ve had a roller derby. They consistently try to make it an interesting festival, rather than just relying on big names. For the first six years, the municipality was constantly trying to shut down SappyFest as it did not fit their ideology. However, recently, it was brought to the town council that SappyFest brings four-hundred-thousand dollars into the town every year, so they’ve since stopped trying to shut it down. They’ve done a little bit to try to help it out and that’s pretty cool. SappyFest keeps a lot of businesses afloat. It’s good vibes. I’ve had to work the past two days but I still feel good.” Hooded Fang. Sappy performers. Toronto. A. Aliermo. Second SappyFest. “It’s within a one block radius, which I love. You don’t need a map. It’s easy to navigate. You just run into other musicians and audience members alike.” Kavana. Sappy Volunteer. Maputo, Mozambique. First SappyFest.""When I first came I was like ‘this is not my music’ and a lot of it went over my head but now that I’ve been to a couple shows I’m like, ‘Wow!’ I think the diversity, the different voices, and perspectives are what makes it popular.” Jeska.

It’s very supportive and stimulating for the local economy.”Partner. Sappy performers. East Coasters. Sixth Sappy Fest. “It’s like everyone’s just on the same party page. Everyone seems like they’re on love drugs, even when they’re not. It’s a beautiful, beautiful, thing. It feels like home, especially for a lot of people that aren’t from here.

Once the watery preamble of the quest is over, Geralt—the player-controlled witcher of the title—faces off against a crackling, cackling djinn amid the wreckage of an ocean-faring vessel now, improbably and magnificently, perched hundreds of feet above sea level. His on-off romantic partner Yennefer, a powerful sorceress, awaits its weakening, ready to trap the magical being within a force field. Why you're here is down to friendship, duty, and no little magic: this is not the first genie the pair has crossed. ""The Last Wish"", or ""Ostatnie życzenie"" in the original Polish, is my favorite short story of the book that bears the same title. It's a collection of side-quest-sized—but still richly detailed and cunningly compelling—tales of the Witcher and his aides and enemies, written by Andrzej Sapkowski in 1993. These books, of which there are several, represent the source material for CD Projekt's three Witcher role-playing games and the early 2000s Polish TV series (and movie), The Hexer. The Last Wish is the second of two such short-story collections, albeit chronologically placed ahead of 1992's Sword of Destiny, and to date the only of Sapkowski's books that I've read. It was recommended after I'd wrapped up Blood and Wine, The Witcher 3's final expansion DLC, as a means to continue my adventures with Geralt and company. It does a fine job of elevating Dandelion to more than just an annoyance to be rescued, the pair's unbreakable friendship laid bare on the page multiple times; and the story that introduces Yennefer of ""Vergerberg"" (as it's written in the 2012 Gollancz edition), the last of its short stories, is a riot of violence, destruction and bedazzlement. It begins innocuously—and, much like the game quest that shares its name, by the water. Geralt and Dandelion are fishing for their breakfast. A gigantic catfish escapes them; instead, they pull up a vase-like container, an amphora, bearing unusual markings on its seal. It's home to a gigantic red djinn which, once released, rather than grant Dandelion even a single wish, proceeds to near strangle the life out of the poet. Seal held tight in hand, Geralt manages to recite what he thinks is an exorcism, and the genie flees from their sight. The witcher picks up his gravely injured friend and takes him to the closest settlement, Rinde, a location not notably featured in any of the video games. There, in a town that heavily penalizes magic users, he is told that just one person, a sorceress with little respect for local laws, might be able to help him. In The Witcher 3, once the djinn has been defeated and released, Geralt sits beside Yennefer and remarks: ""That was a hard fight. Maybe not as hard as the last time we tamed a djinn…"" ""No comparison…"" Yennefer snaps back. ""Half of Rinde suffered then."" In the book, hearing of Dandelion's situation, Yennefer provides her assistance seemingly without much in the way of personal gain—an unlikely turn of events in the eyes of those who know her reputation. An elf, Chireadan, tells the witcher: ""Don't trust her, Geralt. She's dangerous."" Not as dangerous as the djinn. When it returns, summoned and only barely restrained by Yennefer using ""twisted threads of blindingly bright light"", constantly trying to break free like ""a bumble-bee tied to a jug"", proceeds to wreck any parts of the town within its reach. It threatens, too, to flatten the sorceress. Geralt intervenes, quite against Yennefer's wishes, and the two fight and bicker as they tumble through escape portals. ""You moron, you bloody idiot, I almost had him,"" she screams, only for him to respond: ""You had shit-all. I saved your life, you stupid witch."" I'm leaving plenty out, for anyone who wants to read the tale, but it transpires that it was the seal-holding Geralt, not Dandelion, who earned the three wishes upon the djinn's release. His first ""wish"" was the exorcism, but it was far from what Geralt thought it was. In Rinde, he meets a priest, Krepp, who translates on his behalf: ""get out of here and go fuck yourself."" His second wish is for a jailer to physically burst (which he does). His third saves both himself and Yennefer from the Rinde djinn, and sets up ""The Last Wish"" of the video game. It's mentioned more explicitly in The Witcher 3 than it is The Last Wish, but to prevent the rampaging spirit from killing Yennefer, Geralt wishes his fate to be tied with the sorceress' own—and a djinn cannot harm its master. Sapkoswki's words heavily imply that Geralt, typically an unemotional soul, is attracted to Yennefer even before magic comes into the equation, but when he makes his wish ""about us being together always"", she doesn't initially seem receptive to the idea. ""You've condemned yourself,"" she tells her savior, the monster-slayer who will now, forevermore, be by her side—or, at least, tied in some abstract way to it, across time and distance. ""How long has this been going on, Geralt?"" Yennefer sighs in the video game. ""This thing between us? Fifteen? Twenty years? We repeatedly split up, then return to one another. Something draws us to each other. But I can never be certain if it's a true feeling, or merely a bit of mischief by a djinn. I want to know, if when the djinn's magic is gone, we've any magic left of our own."" Trapped, the game's djinn is quick to undo the bond set between the pair by the book's magical menace, in exchange for its freedom. And then they sit there, on this ship atop a mountain, waiting for what comes next. There's been love in the past, sure, and passion and fire—but whether or not that continues is now up to the player.  The game's Geralt can either declare his feelings for Yennefer unchanged, crystalizing their relationship like never before, or claim that now he feels nothing. Yen, for her part, heartily agrees with the romance. If you do decide to rebuff your feelings for her, she'll be shocked. Either way, she insists on reporting the whole event to the emperor, a detail the player has no say about. No matter what, the search for Ciri continues, but I think to dismiss Yennefer is to veer away from the intentions of these characters' creator. If you played the game after reading the book, I think the way that the pair ""gets together"" unsubtly hints at a genuine connection: he cannot take his eyes off her, even though he knows she's not all that she appears to be. And reading it afterwards, I'm glad that I stuck with Yen atop that mountain, on both playthroughs—to not have done so would be to throw away something so very pure in a fantasy world steeped in blood and poison. The seeds sown in 1993's ""The Last Wish"" took a long time to bud, but how they blossom in 2015's game. If you, too, were smitten by this quest, I recommend seeking out the story: it adds context, no little additional narrative weight, and stirs within me, at least, the desire to read more of Sapkoswki's fiction, to hopefully discover further meaningful connections to my favorite role-player of all time.   Follow Mike on Twitter.",3.0
327812,Salted Peanut Butter Cookies,"Servings: 12Prep: 30 minutesTotal: 30 minutes Ingredients1 3/4 cups (packed) light brown sugar2 large eggs, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract1 3/4 cups peanut butter (see Chef's Tip)Coarse-grained sea salt, for garnish Directions 1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a rimmed sheet pan with parchment paper. 2. In a medium bowl, vigorously whisk together the light brown sugar and eggs until incorporated. Whisk in the vanilla extract. Add the peanut butter and mix with a spatula until smooth and completely incorporated, and until no ribbons of peanut butter can be seen. You know the dough is ready when it has the consistency of Play-Doh. 3. Using a scoop or a spoon, form the dough into 12 approximately 2-inch (2- to 2 1/4-ounce) balls and place them on the prepared rimmed sheet pan. For smaller cookies, use a heaping tablespoon. 4. Sprinkle the dough balls lightly with coarse-grained sea salt just before baking. Bake for 20 to 22 minutes, turning the rimmed sheet pan once halfway through baking (for smaller cookies, bake for 16 to 18 minutes). When finished, the cookies will be lightly golden and cracked on top. Let cool completely before serving. 5. You can bake these cookies as soon as the dough is prepared, but they will retain their shape better if you freeze them for 15 minutes before baking. Chef's Tip: While the all-natural stuff works just fine, Skippy is our peanut butter brand of choice for this recipe as we've found it retains the dough shape best. These tasty cookies are gluten-free! Excerpted from Ovenly by Agatha Kulaga & Erin Patinkin (Harlequin). Copyright © 2014. Photograph by Winona Barton-Ballentine.

327987,Trump's Iran deal withdrawal sets off needless international crisis,"In announcing yesterday that he would not waive sanctions against Iran, President Trump put the United States in violation of the nuclear deal and left the agreement’s future in doubt. Why it matters: There’s no denying that this is a crisis of Trump’s own making. Iran is not in violation of the JCPOA, a fact confirmed by not only IAEA inspectors but also by Trump’s own Secretary of Defense. Even the Israeli intelligence that Trump cited shows nothing more than the fact that Iran had a nuclear program prior to 2003. Although the deal didn’t address every concern, it was successfully preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Trump has instead opted for an uncertain future, raising the risks of an Iranian bomb and a U.S–Iranian conflict. It’s another page in the playbook that guided Trump’s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a decision he has since tried to reverse — and his approach to North Korea, which began with a series of increasingly hostile tweets that could have precipitated a war. The bottom line: Trump’s decision on the nuclear deal is the latest example of his tendency to manufacture foreign policy crises where none exist. His “shoot first, ask questions later” foreign policy ultimately makes us all less safe. Emma Ashford is a research fellow at the Cato Institute.",3.0

332238,Colombia stock market seeks to boost trading by listing new funds,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia hopes to attract billions of dollars to its stock market by listing new assets like real estate investment funds to propel trading now limited to a few dozen companies, the head of the bourse said. Colombian Securities Exchange President Juan Pablo Cordoba, interviewed for the Reuters Latin American Investment Summit, said there should be at least double the 69 companies trading on the exchange and called for modifying tax regulations to make the bourse more competitive. The local stock market trades an average of $50 million a day in shares, a figure that pales against the $1.2 billion daily volume in domestic public fixed income instruments and $1 billion in the foreign exchange market Cordoba said the new real estate investment funds would be aimed at raising money in the market for the construction or acquisition of shopping centers, office buildings and other structures. “We’re working toward being able to list those assets in the market, so there will be a new class of equity assets, not company shares but a fund that’s registered in the equity market and traded as a stock,” said Cordoba at the exchange in Bogota. “In terms of market issuance we could be talking about up to 5 trillion pesos, about $2 billion, in the next two or three years,” he said in the interview last week. The funds, which already operate in the United States and Mexico, could be available throughout the Pacific Alliance nations of Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Peru, Cordoba said. The stock exchanges of the four countries also have integrated securities’ trading through the Latin American Integrated Market (MILA). Such investment vehicles could help attract foreign capital as an alternative to the more traditional stock market, which has struggled to attract interest from companies, even with a 10 percent increase in share prices so far this year. Cordoba, 52, said that of the 69 companies listed, investor interest is focused on about 20 firms. Progress needs to be made on regulatory issues to make the market more competitive on taxation to increase investor interest, he said. The government also needs to urgently clarify rules governing the mining and oil sectors, which have been hit by popular consultations by local communities on projected investments, discouraging a range of new exploration and production projects. “The world has a lot of liquidity and nowhere to invest it, so if Colombia does it well or better than its neighbors, we will have a good opportunity,” said Cordoba, who holds a doctorate in economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. The exchange chief said that a recent peace accord with Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels will also open investment opportunities in sectors like agriculture, which could lead to the creation of additional investment funds for local capital markets. Before the peace agreement was signed late last year, the FARC held sway over large expanses of farmland.

332608,"Madrid authorities order Lime, Wind and Voi to halt e-scooter sharing in the Spanish city – TechCrunch","More evidence has emerged that the e-scooter sharing market faces a bumpy ride, as news circulates that authorities in Madrid have revoked licenses for all three operators in the city. Lime, Wind and Voi, are being given a maximum of 72 hours to remove scooters from the city’s streets, whilst I understand it follows a recent change in mobility laws in Madrid that stipulate where and at what speed e-scooters can be driven. Specifically, e-scooters can only operate in designated bike lanes and only on roads that have a speed limit below 30 kilometres per hour. Sidewalk and pedestrian areas were also recently banned following Spain’s first death from an e-scooter accident in August. Meanwhile, my sources in Madrid tell me a meeting has just taken place between the city’s transport authorities to presumably find a resolution for the conflict. The outcome of those talks isn’t yet known, although the path to compliance may actually be relatively simple. Lime, Wind and Voi will almost certainly need to make changes to their respective apps, which could include geo-fencing where the e-scooters can be ridden, as well as communicating those restrictions to users and legally enforcing them via their terms of service. In other words, this may yet prove to be little more than a speed bump in the current e-scooter race, which is frenzied, to say the least. Asked to comment on the situation in Madrid, Voi — which has made a virtue out of its ability to work with local governments and transport authorities — issued the following statement: Voi is working closely with the authorities in Madrid to make sure that our app complies fully with the city’s new guidelines. We are confident that we will be able to get our scooters back on the streets of Madrid in a short time, to help residents and visitors travel around the city quickly and safely, in an environmentally-friendly, low-impact way. Wind also responded, issuing the following statement: WIND offers a convenient, inexpensive and quick access to short distance transportation in urban areas. We are putting a strong focus on user-friendliness and road safety. We are collaborating with the city government in Madrid. Our team met with the authorities today. We look forward to continue working with the city to fulfill this new requirement issued today. I’ve also reached out to Lime and will update this article if and when I hear back.",4.0
338031,"An Ode to Two Dots, the Game That Eases My Anxious Mind"," In Two Dots, the goal is erasure. Each level presents its own settings, objectives, and special tools and weapons to help or thwart you, but the premise is the same. A round begins with an array of multi-colored dots spread across the screen, and it’s the player’s job to connect two or more same-colored dots to clear them. Connecting four dots of the same color into a square disappears every dot of that color in a thrilling and efficient use of a thumb swipe. When you disappear the required number of dots in an allotted number of moves—plus ladybugs, or bricks, or bombs, or ice blocks—you beat the level. I play when I'm in line at the market and when my boyfriend’s out of town. I play when my writing goes stale and I’ve been in my house alone all day and need to give my brain a break. I play when I’m talking on the phone with someone who makes me nervous and when I’m in the car at a red light trying not to let the claustrophobia of being trapped in line tip me into panic. I play as a reward when I accomplish something that I was avoiding, and I play to distract myself from the physical symptoms of anxiety while I accomplish something I was avoiding. During air travel, while forced air whistles inside a creaky cabin and the landscape tilts nauseatingly below, I play level after level to keep my fear in check. Playing in bed before I sleep numbs my brain just enough so I can drift off into a deep, dreamless slumber. Americans are feeling more anxious these days, and with people growing more divided by the hour, there's no lack of reasons, especially as a woman, to feel afraid of losing basic rights, protection, and care. But my anxiety would be happening in the best of times—when activated, it shoots obsessive, intrusive thoughts into my head probably thousands of times a day. Am I going to faint? Am I going insane? Will I lose control of the wheel and steer off the bridge? Will I scream in the meeting? Will I strip off all my clothes while I’m teaching? Will I slit my wrist? Will I bang my head against the ceramic tile in the shower? Will I suffocate? Will I go crazy? Will I throw up? These thoughts come unbidden from ten to hundreds of times a day, causing a surge of adrenaline to course through me, which in turn causes my heart to race, muscles to shake, mouth to go dry, and head to grow dizzy and lightheaded. My pupils dilate, making lights too bright and garish. I reel with nausea as my stomach cramps, blood drains from my face and head, causing pale lips, dizziness, the whole shebang. The thoughts return almost immediately, no matter how many times I brush them off, swat them away, talk back to them, or write them down. My psychiatrist says they are a result of an exhausted mind stressed by chronic anxiety and too little serotonin. My therapist says these attacks will stop once I stop being afraid of them. Another therapist says they are due to OCD and disordered thinking and that I should be on more medication. Medicine helps, but not enough. Therapy helps, but inconsistently. Friends and family help, sometimes, when they’re available and in the right mood. But you know what has helped most reliably? You guessed it. One reason games can be so alluring, according to psychologist Douglas Gentile, whose work focuses on video gaming and addiction, is because they satisfy an ""ABC"" of human needs. ""The A Is Autonomy, we like to feel we're in control,"" he said. ""B is Belonging, we like to feel connected to other people. And the C is Competence, we like to feel that we're good at what we do."" My therapist told me that the body metabolizes adrenaline in two to three minutes. That means if I can distract myself from catastrophic thinking for just two to three minutes when I get an adrenaline dump from a sensation that alarms me, the adrenaline will be metabolized and stop dilating my pupils, twisting my gut, and making my armpits and palms sweat. The trick, in other words, is to focus on something else for a little while. But it is very, very hard to ignore the thought or visceral sense that you are in danger. All physical and psychological wiring we come with is programmed to take fearful thoughts and feelings very seriously. My therapist taught me breathing exercises and affirmations and physical movements to distract myself once the adrenaline and catastrophic thoughts start. Those didn’t really help. Once I discovered Two Dots, everything changed. Distraction techniques are a popular tool in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), one of the most effective types of therapy for panic and anxiety disorders. One therapist taught me to drink water, list all the blue things in a room, sing a song, when I started to feel the onslaught of anxiety symptoms ramping up. This is called Attention Bias Modification Treatment, and it works by shifting attention from a threatening stimulus—like anxious thoughts or physical sensations—to a benign or benevolent one, like colored dots. If only I could also connect fear-to-fear, symptom-to-symptom, hormone-to-hormone, and force them to cancel each other out; use their collective energy to burst their bubbles, explode their grasp on me. More from VICE: I play Two Dots not only to distract myself and sharpen and redirect my mind, but also to determine whether something I'm feeling is more than just a bout of anxiety. If I feel dizzy, dry-mouthed, nauseous, or shaky, I play five minutes of Two Dots. If I still feel that way after the game, I can be worried. But if all the symptoms fade while playing, it’s not appendicitis, heart attack, stroke, anaphylactic shock. True physical illness won’t be alleviated by an in-app purchase, but anxiety might be. The game is a harbinger of normalcy; a reminder that the world I know in my non-anxious moments still exists. I can access it through my phone, which, though stress chemicals are making me feel as if I’m losing my mind, I still know how to operate. One of the most terrifying aspects of anxiety is a feeling of derealization or depersonalization, which is a disorientation in one’s own body and surroundings. The world goes wonky—internal processes like thoughts and feelings take on an out-of-body, exaggerated magnitude that feels at once foreign and claustrophobic. But if I lose myself in Two Dots, I enter a familiar world where I know the rules, connect pink dots with pink, brown with brown, watch them explode. By refocusing my mind on a repetitive and engaging task, Two Dots might work the same way—it interrupts the deluge of catastrophic thoughts and images associated with anxiety and panic.Related studies have shown that video games can help alleviate depression by improving mood and heart rhythms, activating the parasympathetic nervous system, and disrupting thought patterns of self-doubt. In 2009, The Washington Post told the story of 49-year-old Gail Nichols, who struggled with depression for years. Her favorite game was Bejeweled, which, similar to Two Dots, requires players to organize gems in rows by color. “In her favorite version,” reporter Shankar Vedantam writes, “colored gems drop endlessly onto the screen, and Nichols said she falls into a trance of simultaneous concentration and relaxation that she calls Zen.” I can relate. I find myself thinking about Two Dots in my non Two Dots life, when I’m trying to untangle something in my mind. When I fought with my boyfriend and we turned away from each other in bed, spines curved away, breathing quietly, I imagined swiping dots away to disappear lines and boxes, making a clear way forward. When struggling with an essay, I turned from the computer screen to picture connecting green dots to expose neat squares of yellow, blue, and white—making order, organizing. When I was sick and lying prone on the couch, I envisioned my body filled with dots of virus, wishing that with one-inch moves of my finger, I could make them disappear. I play Two Dots so often, some might wonder if it’s to my detriment. How people relate to games—and come to depend on them—is a burgeoning field of study. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NBCI) defines video game addiction as “excessive and compulsive use of computer or video games that results in social and/or emotional problems; despite these problems, the gamer is unable to control this excessive use.” The Illinois Institute for Addiction Recovery, meanwhile, classifies video game addiction as an impulse-control disorder similar to pathological gambling. They list some signs and symptoms of the addiction as “Feelings of restlessness, moodiness, depression, or irritability when attempting to cut down use of the Game; Jeopardized or risked loss of significant relationships, job, educational or career opportunities because of Game use; Lies to family members, friends, therapists, or others to conceal the extent of involvement with the Game.” To be diagnosed with the disorder, the behavior has to last for at least a year and “significantly impair personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other aspects of your life.” According to the NCBI, 59 percent of Americans play video games (among 12 to 17 year olds, the percentage is 97 percent). It’s hard to say how many of those people—if any—are addicted to playing, because “gaming disorder” was only included in the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases in 2018, and the designation itself is still controversial. The research that does exist also tends to focus on the potentially addictive qualities of more immersive Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) than simpler iPhone games like Two Dots. Still, one study revealed that out of the 119 online gamers they sampled, 7 percent were classified as “‘dependent’ individuals who were at risk of developing a psychological and behavioral dependence.” I’m lucky that I don’t have an addictive personality. I can play Two Dots, and when I need to do something else, I can stop. I’m not part of the at-risk population for game addiction, which is comprised of adolescent single males. I am not adolescent, single, or male, and the game does not interfere with my life. In fact, it helps me tolerate it. And it’s much less addictive than benzodiazapenes, which I’ve been repeatedly prescribed to help manage my anxiety for decades. My therapist says my use of it as an attention-modification technique is fine, though he’d like to see me be able to turn my thoughts away from the obsessive and catastrophic unaided. The worst I've endured as a result of playing was a case of tendinitis in my right shoulder from holding my phone aloft for too long when lying in bed. And while I read a lot less than I used to, I consider Two Dots to be a form of meditation and avoidance that I’m comfortable with. Though it was with some sadness that I passed level 1,000 a few weeks ago. Two Dots is a litmus test for how anxious I am—how many hours I’ve logged trying to calm down, distract from suffering, anxiety, insomnia, and fear. I passed level 1000 in my doctor’s waiting room before an appointment, which was a follow-up for abnormal heart palpitations I’d had, likely due to stress. It saddened me to see, in levels, how much this past year I’ve needed help to feel ok. I came home the next afternoon exhausted after teaching and battling intrusive thoughts and lay on the couch to play. I had two moves left on a very hard level I’d been struggling with for days. I scanned the screen and felt my breathing slow. I noticed one square that I hadn’t seen before, tucked in the left corner of the screen. If I swiped the four green dots in the square, they’d explode not only that square but all green dots on the screen, not to mention all the green ladybugs, and then any ladybug-adjacent blinking bombs. I carefully surveyed the screen to ensure this was the best move. I swiped. All the green dots exploded. The ladybugs fluttered off, the bombs detonated, and the points racked up. I won, for now: Like anxiety, Two Dots can go on infinitely if you let it, worlds and weapons like symptoms rearranging and expanding. Two Dots will save your scores and progress, and show you those of your social media friends when you log on to the app through Facebook. As I advanced from level 15 to 150 to 300 to 800 to 1,004, I marveled at how many of my friends had played as much as I had. I wondered what compelled them to log so many hours, and where they played, what they were trying to avoid or decompress from. As I pushed on into the higher levels—700, 900, 1,050—the number of friends I was competing with dwindled from 50 to five. Now, at level 1,079, I'm almost alone in the stratosphere, but still I climb—higher and higher, seeking a crown in an empty kingdom.

346155,"To succeed, AVs will have to communicate with human drivers","Human drivers are faulted for most accidents involving autonomous vehicles, but closer inspection reveals the responsibility for such incidents is more complex and shared: many appear to have occurred when an AV took an action that was technically legal and safe, but which a human driver did not expect. The big picture: As more AVs are tested and put into mainstream service, developers must ensure that humans interact safely and efficiently with them, whether on the road or as pedestrians. If not integrated into a larger change-management plan, AVs could end up causing more accidents, congestion and public resistance. The way AVs drive, at least for now, is fundamentally different from the way humans do, which may create inefficient and dangerous miscommunications. Machines learn by rules, algorithms, data-driven decisions and visual inputs of object and trajectory — all guided by the prime directive of avoiding objects in their path. Humans rely on different principles and experiences, as well as subtler cues from the environment, drivers and pedestrians (for example, the head nod that signals the go-ahead to merge).  Humans also operate in a risk-reward setting — balancing the odds of an accident, say, with the odds of missing a flight. What's needed: Public policy should ensure that autonomous development includes ways for humans to better identify and interact with AVs. While a lidar unit on top of an AV is usually a dead giveaway, a Tesla on autopilot is not. Beyond identification, machine-to-human communication needs to be explicitly designed. (An instructive example is Jaguar’s experimentation with “eyes” that communicate with pedestrians.) If AVs can communicate their intentions and next moves, humans will better respond. The bottom line: AV developers, manufacturers, insurers and regulators will have to devise a more specific, thought-out vision for how humans and machines share the road. If they don't, public resistance could well impede the AV transition. Steve Verney is the CFO of National Auto Care and the former EVP and chief risk officer of Allstate.

351243,Lyft Premier Ride Mode - Commute Upgrade,"Your date nights, late nights, and pretty much any other night out on the town have just received an upgrade.

Premier Mode will kick off first in San Francisco, San Jose, Los Angeles, and New York City. The company says the program will expand to other markets in the coming months.Lyft decided to launch Premier because 60% of passengers have requested the option for an upscale ride (usually for business meetings or special occasions), according to Komal Kirtikar, head of product marketing. A nicer car won't come cheap, though. Lyft Premier will cost about twice as much as a classic Lyft ride (prices may vary depending on the city). However, Lyft is enticing people to try out the service with a summer promotion of 20% off your first 10 Premier rides. With newer car services such as Via and Gett emphasizing reasonable prices over luxury (a strategy Lyft followed in the beginning as well), it's surprising to see Lyft go this route. In fact, it's the exact opposite approach taken by the company's main competitor Uber, which started out with a fleet of stately black town cars. But it appears ride-share service users appreciate variety, and that's what Uber and Lyft are able to offer. (Uber launched its ""Arrive By"" feature last month, and Lyft recently tested advance scheduling for rides, so users on both platforms can schedule trips in advance.) But with today's Lyft news comes one big question: Is Premier worth the cost? It really depends on what you're looking for. If you want a quick trip home and don't need any perks, it's probably best to save some cash and go with Lyft Line, the app's ride-sharing option, or Lyft Classic. However, if you're having a business meeting on the way to the airport or planning a bachelorette party, the splurge for something more luxurious may be worth it.",4.5
352330,This Is the Best Way to Make Guacamole,"Guacamole isn't exactly thought of as difficult to prepare. It's just a spicy, buttery green mash of avocado and salsa-y stuff, right? Wrong. So wrong.

356373,First look at Instagram’s self-policing Time Well Spent tool – TechCrunch,"Are you Overgramming? Instagram is stepping up to help you manage overuse rather than leaving it to iOS and Android’s new screen time dashboards. After TechCrunch first reported Instagram was prototyping a Usage Insights feature last month, the Facebook sub-company’s CEO Kevin Systrom confirmed its forthcoming launch. Tweeting our article, Systrom wrote, “It’s true . . . We’re building tools that will help the IG community know more about the time they spend on Instagram – any time should be positive and intentional . . . Understanding how time online impacts people is important, and it’s the responsibility of all companies to be honest about this. We want to be part of the solution. I take that responsibility seriously.” Now we have our first look at the tool via Jane Manchun Wong, who’s recently become one of TechCrunch’s favorite sources thanks to her skills at digging new features out of apps’ Android APK code. Though Usage Insights might change before an official launch, these screenshots give us an idea of what Instagram will include. Instagram declined to comment, saying it didn’t have any more to share about the feature at this time. This unlaunched version of Instagram’s Usage Insights tool offers users a daily tally of their minutes spent on the app. They’ll be able to set a time-spent daily limit, and get a reminder once they exceed that. There’s also a shortcut to manage Instagram’s notifications so the app is less interruptive. Instagram has been spotted testing a new hamburger button that opens a slide-out navigation menu on the profile. That might be where the link for Usage Insights shows up, judging by this screenshot. Instagram doesn’t appear to be going so far as to lock you out of the app after your limit, or fading it to grayscale, which might annoy advertisers and businesses. But offering a handy way to monitor your usage that isn’t buried in your operating system’s settings could make users more mindful. Instagram has an opportunity to be a role model here, especially if it gives its Usage Insights feature sharper teeth. For example,  rather than a single notification when you hit your daily limit, it could remind you every 15 minutes after, or create some persistent visual flag so you know you’ve broken your self-imposed rule. Instagram has already started to push users toward healthier behavior with a “You’re all caught up” notice when you’ve seen everything in your feed and should stop scrolling. I expect more apps to attempt to self-police with tools like these rather than leaving themselves at the mercy of iOS’s Screen Time and Android’s Digital Wellbeing features that offer more drastic ways to enforce your own good intentions. Both let you see overall usage of your phone and stats about individual apps. iOS lets you easily dismiss alerts about hitting your daily limit in an app but delivers a weekly usage report (ironically via notification), while Android will gray out an app’s icon and force you to go to your settings to unlock an app once you exceed your limit. For Android users especially, Instagram wants to avoid looking like such a time sink that you put one of those hard limits on your use. In that sense, self-policing shows both empathy for its users’ mental health, but is also a self-preservation strategy. With Instagram slated to launch a long-form video hub that could drive even longer session times this week, Usage Insights could be seen as either hypocritical or more necessary than ever. New time management tools coming to iOS (left) and Android (right); images via The Verge. Instagram is one of the world’s most beloved apps, but also one of the most easily abused. From envy spiraling as you watch the highlights of your friends’ lives to body image issues propelled by its endless legions of models, there are plenty of ways to make yourself feel bad scrolling the Insta feed. And since there’s so little text, no links and few calls for participation, it’s easy to zombie-browse in the passive way research shows is most dangerous. We’re in a crisis of attention. Mobile app business models often rely on maximizing our time spent to maximize their ad or in-app purchase revenue. But carrying the bottomless temptation of the internet in our pockets threatens to leave us distracted, less educated and depressed. We’ve evolved to crave dopamine hits from blinking lights and novel information, but never had such an endless supply. There’s value to connecting with friends by watching their days unfold through Instagram and other apps. But tech giants are thankfully starting to be held responsible for helping us balance that with living our own lives.

360665,"Blake Lively Post-Baby Body, Sunrise Interview","It seems like whenever a celebrity has a baby, everyone becomes fixated on how quickly she ""bounces back"" after the pregnancy. Thankfully, Blake Lively is having none of it. Lively sat down for a video interview with Sunrise earlier this week to promote her film The Shallows, which is now being released in Australia, and she promptly shut down the idea that a woman has to ""bounce back"" and strive for a perfect ""post-baby body.""The segment started off awkwardly enough when the enthusiastic interviewer introduced Lively as someone who “is so well-known for being Mrs. Ryan Reynolds.” Sure, Lively and Reynolds make an adorable couple, but come on: When will mainstream media realize women are more than whom they've married? After all, Blake was already (and remains) successful on her own, way before she was ""Mrs. Reynolds.""When asked about her fitness regime, Lively shared that she had to do a lot of endurance training eight months after having her baby in order to prepare for the film. The interviewer then points out that doing a film like The Shallows is a great way to get a hot post-baby body. ""It's so unfair, it's so celebrated: 'This is what someone looks like after having a baby,'"" Lively responded. ""And I think a woman's body after having a baby is pretty amazing."" “You don’t have to have be Victoria’s Secret–ready right away,"" she added. ""You’ve just done this incredible miracle that life has to offer.” Her comments are a reminder of the pressure women face to be ""in shape"" before, during, and after pregnancy. Celebrity women are, of course, closely scrutinized when they make their first post-baby public appearance, and they're celebrated if they've achieved what is deemed an ""ideal body.""Instead, Lively said during her interview, “You gave birth to a human being. I would really like to see that celebrated.” ",3.5

Why it matters: McCabe's interview with Pelley marks the first person involved in those meetings to speak publicly. ""They were counting noses,"" Pelley told ""CBS This Morning"" on Thursday. ""They were not asking cabinet members whether they would vote for or against removing the president, but they were speculating."" The NYT first reported on this back in September of 2017.  ""I never pursued or authorized recording the President and any suggestion that I have ever advocated for the removal of the President is absolutely false,"" a Justice Department spokesperson on behalf of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told Axios at the time. The other side: A DOJ spokesman commented on McCabe's interview, saying Rosenstein ""rejects Mr. McCabe’s recitation of events as inaccurate and factually incorrect. The Deputy Attorney General never authorized any recording that Mr. McCabe references."" ""As the Deputy Attorney General previously stated, based on his personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment, nor was the DAG in a position to consider invoking the 25th Amendment.""

371748,Wealthy students disproportionately receive extra time on standardized tests,"Students in affluent school districts are more likely to be given special accommodations for extra time on tests like the SAT and ACT, according to an analysis from the Wall Street Journal. Details: Federal data shows that at affluent public schools where no more than 10% of students are eligible for free or reduced-cost school lunches, 4.2% of students have been granted time extensions for test taking known as ""504"" designations — meant to level the playing field for students with anxiety or ADHD. At schools where 75% or more of the students are eligible for subsidized lunches, only 1.6% have 504 designations. The number of students granted 504 designations more than tripled from 2000 to 2016, according to WSJ's analysis. White students possess 64% of the 504 designations, despite accounting for slightly more than half of school enrollment. Schools make the decision for whether to grant a 504, often with input from a medical professional. But the Journal notes that wealthy parents are more likely to know the option for extra time exists, in addition to having the resources to pay for an outside medical evaluation. The big picture: Historically, standardized tests like the SAT have favored students from wealthy, more educated families who have had the opportunity to take the PSAT or pay for test prep, according to the Washington Post. WSJ's analysis of extra time accommodations adds another layer to the wealth disparity in standardized test performance. The advantages affluent families hold in the college admissions process has come under fresh scrutiny thanks to Operation Varsity Blues, a massive scandal that has seen dozens of parents prosecuted for a conspiracy to pay to get their children admitted to elite schools. The College Board announced last week that it's introducing an ""adversity score"" that evaluates socioeconomic and environmental factors so that colleges may choose from a more diverse pool of candidates.

A beautiful duopoly
Enrico Fermi and the future of venture capital Market movements in the technology sector — particularly in SaaS tech companies — are causing a stir among investors. It’s always a challenge to estimate valuation ranges for publicly traded companies such as LinkedIn, Salesforce and Workday because these calculations require assumptions of growth. Twitter is another beast. Some people get obsessed about enterprise value; others focus on the gross margins or multiples of R&D spendings of these companies in an effort to come up with a reasonable explanation of what’s happening. Investors are trying to draw parallels between these publicly traded companies and private venture-funded companies, but a number of differences exist between these two types of investment opportunities (or “asset classes,” as we refer to them in fund lingo). Let’s review some major differences between investing in stocks versus venture capital. When we invest in private companies, the capital we infuse makes a big difference for the company — or at least it should. After a seed round, a startup becomes a bona fide company. After Series A, it becomes a contender. In public markets, with the exception of activism, equity trades make no difference for the company’s activities and margins. So if a market correction does take place and the stock plummets, the investor loses value significantly — and that’s value the company did not earn operationally to begin with. In venture investing, every dollar invested should make the company better. So if I were to put my money to use, why would I invest in stocks just to be at the mercy of Mr. Market? Private equity and sovereign wealth funds agree with this notion (that’s why we saw more unicorns last year). Within the confines of a fund, we want to keep the invest-to-exit period as short as possible. In public markets, you can buy and sell equities and their derivatives at any time. In the venture capital world, we don’t have that luxury. We buy into a company at some point, and we must exit at another point. The exit generates either a profit or a partial or full loss. But within the confines of a fund, we want to keep the invest-to-exit period as short as possible, regardless of whether we profit or not. If we profit, we boost our IRR. If we lose, we cut our losses quickly and move on. We don’t hold long positions in portfolio companies due to our fund mandates. And because the deals inside a venture capital fund are finite, a fund itself must be finite — and it is. Deals in venture come sequentially and often in bursts, and a deal today will not be available tomorrow (unlike the public markets where one can buy and sell any security, any time). Deal flow and access to deals are vital for VC firms. So, at any point, the challenge in venture capital is to choose the most favorable deal in the current set of deals in the pipeline, which will soon change. And choose we must. We’re constantly running out of time inside the fund, because we have a set investment period. Therefore, another problem emerges: How many deals should we invest in, and how big should the checks be? One shortcut is to invest in as many of them as possible, which would create high visibility in the marketplace, but the check sizes will be small, and the returns probably won’t move the needle. Another solution is to invest in x number of companies per partner, which is even more arbitrary. It’s actually a difficult stochastic problem, and understanding return distributions, the nature of the deal flow, the overall size of the fund and the investment horizon are some of the parameters that would go into solving it. If we invest in stocks, we can buy derivatives contracts to hedge our bets. Those are like insurance for which we pay a premium, and we are covered if the market moves against the direction of our bet. We can do this on both the long and short side. We can’t really do it for our VC bets, other than, perhaps, shorting the Russell 2000 index. So if you make a bet, you’re stuck with it. Capital is moving in all sorts of directions right now. In VC, there’s no leverage — but that’s a good thing. We invest only if we have capital in the fund. Therefore, our losses are capped at the investment level. One wrong bet in a leveraged scenario in the public markets can wipe out a fund several times over. Public market stocks are correlated to one another because of the existence of their historic returns. We don’t have this situation in VC, so Markowitz won’t apply, which makes portfolio formation much more complex. Meanwhile, the path to liquidation has changed for VC. Before, the path to liquidity was to go public or sell to a larger company. Now, it is via private sales to sovereign wealth funds (SWF) or private equity. Institutional funds have built tremendous amounts of capital that are sitting on the sidelines. There has been a surge in the number of “family office” establishments (mainly in the last two years). Capital is being funneled to a number of new investment vehicles that have a high level of thirst for advanced, and often exotic, investment products. The most recent sale of Lyft shares to Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal is just one example. (The value of Prince Bin Talal’s 34.9 million Twitter shares has shrunk by about $500 million since last October, when he upped his long position). Capital is moving around investment vehicles in different ways than before; right now, it is liking venture capital. VC-funded firms are founded on the premise that they will disrupt existing markets. Is venture capital immune to macroeconomic events such as fluctuations in GDP, inflation or unemployment rates? Of course not. A sizeable decline at the institutional level will necessitate portfolio rebalancing. When that happens, the influx of capital into the venture capital industry typically declines, thereby causing investment activity to drop. However, VC-funded firms are founded on the premise that they will disrupt existing markets by introducing innovative products and services, which depends less on capital and more on talent. So a correction should actually lift venture returns in the long run, particularly if it hits certain sub-verticals like SaaS. It would then be easier for newcomers to recruit talent away from incumbents. These corrective declines in the stock market work to the benefit of venture-funded firms and the VC industry, as long as they are not catastrophic. Capital is moving in all sorts of directions right now (other than the stock market). Let’s just hope that more of it finds its way into venture capital.",4.0

394406,Westworld Clementine - Angela Sarafyan Interview,"Angela Sarafyan is no new face to Hollywood. The 33-year-old has been appearing in TV shows (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, American Horror Story) and movies (The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part 2) since 2000. But when she appeared in Westworld as the altruistic robot prostitute Clementine, all we could think was, Who is she? Despite her prolific IMDB page, only now is she getting ready to attend her first awards show — the Screen Actors Guild Awards this Sunday. “I always say that I don’t want to go to anything unless I have a reason to be there,” Sarafyan said when we caught up with her to talk about that very reason. She and her Westworld castmates are nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Dramatic Series, which is no small feat when you consider they're nominated by their acting peers in SAG-AFTRA. In the breakout drama, which is nominated for two other Screen Actors Guild awards (Outstanding Action Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Comedy or Drama Series and Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series for Thandie Newton), she walks the line between playing a futuristic android and saloon girl in the Wild West. Ahead, we talk about how she prepared for the role, what purpose her character serves in the theme park of Westworld, and why Clementine's final scene was so painful to watch. What did you think of Westworld when you first read the script?“I didn’t really know anything about it, and only three pages of lines were sent to me as an audition. But when I looked at them, I got goosebumps. It was like nothing I ever auditioned for, and it was some of the best writing I ever read, like beautiful poetry — Gertrude Stein, Edgar Allan Poe, or a line of Shakespeare. I read it over and over and over in the middle of the night, thinking, What is this?”Do you look for literary inspiration when preparing for a role? “Yeah, my acting teacher would say, ‘If you’re not familiar with the great writings of playwrights like Tennessee Williams or Shakespeare or the huge library of characters and stories that exist, you can’t bring them into current-day roles.’ Like, for Alien, Sigourney Weaver drew inspiration from Henry V. Thinking she’d probably never get to play Henry V, she found him in her character Ellen Ripley.”Was your portrayal of Clementine inspired by any great literary prostitutes?“No one specific. I've always been fascinated with prostitutes and strippers and I do have a book on them — it’s about all the different kinds of sex workers and all the actors who have played them in history. I am fascinated by the women who are empowered by the work, who find glory in it. In the time and place that Westworld’s set, prostitutes aren’t particularly looked down upon, and there’s a lot of power in prostitution for Clementine.”The role of every host in Westworld is to fulfill the fantasies of its guests. If Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) is the damsel in distress, is Clementine the hooker with a heart of gold?“I think she is. She embodies love and so she has this kind of naiveté. She falls in love with all the characters without any expectations. This is someone who is like a child. She isn’t bitter. There isn’t a cynicism to her, and I love that.”Part of Clementine’s backstory includes saving money for her family to move and have a better a life, but that almost seems like an intrusion on the fantasy she exists to fulfill. What purpose do you think it serves? “I think it adds to her empathetic quality and allows her to not necessarily hate her job — it’s an opportunity, an opportunity to save her family. Everything she does ties back to that empathy.”Her empathy is her humanity.“Yeah, it makes her more human. So when you see how inhumanely she — and really all the hosts — are treated in the end, you really feel it.”",2.0
396727,Nasa Exoplanet Earth-Like Planet Horoscope Signs Myth,"Last night, news broke that NASA had found seven Earth-like planets orbiting a sun of their very own. This, of course, suggests that there really could be life out there besides us Earthlings, but here at Refinery29, we didn't just have the astronomical on our minds. As with all things sky-bound, we had to wonder: Will this throw our astrological fate into jeopardy? Fear not, stargazers — this is one celestial issue that's pretty cut and dry. Trappist-1 and its cute lil' exoplanets exist outside of our solar system — seriously, they are very, very far away. Since basically every earthbound discipline of astrology pertains only to our solar system, it's safe to say Trappist-1's system won't do a thing to our readings. That said, don't feel bad if you wondered about this when you first heard the news. Never forget the Ophiuchus debacle of September 2016, in which NASA and astrologers the world over had to speak out and quiet our fears that we'd been reading the wrong horoscope all our lives. Can you blame us for being on the lookout for other cosmic shakeups? Let this be a reminder, once and for all, that astrology and astronomy may come up against each other, but they rarely intermingle. Now that that's settled, we can turn our attention to theorizing what the horoscopes are like on these distant, Earth-like exoplanets.",3.5
398531,Transgender Republican On Bathroom Protections,"Many of the thousands of attendees of this week's Conservative Political Action Conference are treating the gathering as a celebration of Donald Trump's whirlwind first month in office. But for Jordan Evans, one recent move by the White House has cast a cloud over CPAC: the decision to lift an Obama-era directive protecting the rights of transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity. Evans, 25, is a Republican. She's also transgender. She saw the bathroom access protections as Trump's ""first big litmus test” on LGBTQ rights. And, in her mind, he failed. “Anyone can keep an LGBT envoy, anyone can hold the flag, but you have to believe in the message and you have to enforce it,” she told Refinery29. ""I feel like Donald Trump let me down on this one.” The Massachusetts native didn’t vote for the president. Turned off by the vitriol in the campaign, she backed Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson instead. But some of Trump’s remarks, including at the Republican National Convention, gave her hope that he would do right by the LGBTQ community as commander-in-chief. “I’m very disappointed,"" says Evans, a library trustee in Charlton, MA. ""I wanted to believe that Trump would be an ally because he said he would. But he didn’t come through for me.” Even after news of the decision broke, Evans was encouraged by reports that Betsy DeVos, Trump's Education Secretary, initially argued against the reversal. But DeVos sought to shoot down such speculation in a Wednesday speech, criticizing the guidance from the Obama administration as an example of ""overreach.""Evans, who says she is America's only openly transgender Republican elected official, came to CPAC this year with a sign that reads ""Proud to be Conservative, Proud to be Transgender, proud to be American #SameTeam."" While some GOP allies on the issue, including Caitlyn Jenner, have publicly criticized Trump's decision on bathroom access, she knows not everyone at CPAC shares her views. As she spoke to reporters outside the main ballroom, a woman who identified herself as a ""Tea Partier"" chimed in to argue that the issue — and all other decisions related to schools — really should be left to the states to decide. After a brief debate over limiting the role of the federal government in education vesus the constitutional right to protection against discrimination for transgender youth, the two found something they could agree on: the need to repeal the Department of Education.

404011,Congress Enters Garfield Gender Debate On Wikipedia,"While many members of Congress have been busy discussing matters like reproductive rights and the opioid epidemic, at least one has been worried about a different (but apparently equally pressing) issue: Garfield's gender. Yes, the cartoon. There's been a long, ongoing debate among contributors to the cat's Wikipedia page over whether he's a boy, a girl, or somewhere else on the gender spectrum, according to New York Magazine. Since we have yet to find a way to resolve this issue civilly, it's found its way into the hands of the law. According to the Twitter account congress-edits, which documents every Wikipedia revision that comes from an IP address within Congress, a congressperson just changed the entry by removing it from the ""Male characters in comics"" category. ""Garfield does not have a gender,"" the documentation reads. ""He should not be in the male comic characters category."" This congressperson may be correct. The comic's creator, Jim Davis, told Mental Floss that the character doesn't have a gender. ""Garfield is very universal. By virtue of being a cat, really, he’s not really male or female or any particular race or nationality, young or old. It gives me a lot more latitude for the humor for the situations,"" he said. However, another Wikipedia editor by the name of DrCliche thinks this shouldn't be taken so literally. ""This is a comment explaining the philosophy of Garfield’s universal appeal,"" they wrote. Whoever edited the entry — or perhaps a different congressperson — also got rid of a comma in the following sentence: ""Part of the strip's broad pop cultural appeal is due to its lack of social or political commentary; though this was Davis's original intention, he also admitted that his 'grasp of politics isn't strong,' joking that for many years, he thought 'OPEC was a denture adhesive.'"" (The comma used that be after ""joking that""). We'd say the correct usage in that situation is ambiguous. Kind of like Garfield.",3.0
404666,Jon Gosselin Male Stripper Show Atlantic City,"Do you live anywhere remotely near South Jersey? Are you up to do something weird next weekend? Have you ever wondered what the dad on Jon & Kate Plus 8 looks like in his skivvies? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then boy, have we got a treat for you: Jon Gosselin has a brand spanking new gig as a male stripper in Atlantic City. The former reality star announced via Twitter that he is joining the male entertainment show at Caesar's Dusk Nightclub in Atlantic City (where he currently DJs and works as a promoter as well). ""I'm an integral part of the show,"" he told ET Online on Saturday. The 39-year-old will make his big debut next weekend in the Magic Mike-esque Men Untamed Male Revue Show on Saturday, April 1. (Perhaps he's just running a long-con of an April Fool's Day joke on us?) The owner of the club, Eric Millstein, expanded on Gosselin's starring role in the ""very, very classy"" production, telling USA Today that Gosselin will perform in the opening and closing numbers and be ""highlighted"" as a dancer. ""He’s been rehearsing with [our performers], doing everything that it takes to make sure that he participates in the fun kind of way that’s entertaining for everybody,"" Millstein said, ""and he’s excited about it and so are we we’re happy to have him."" When asked whether Gosselin — currently at odds with ex-wife and co-parent to their many kids, Kate — would be stripping down to his boy-shorts like his fellow dancers, Millstein said, ""He will be performing in the spirit of the program that he’s participating in 100%."" We'll take that as a resounding yes. ""Ticket sales are fantastic,"" he added. ""Everybody’s curious."" Accurate. Gosselin also seems to be enjoying the more clothing-friendly parts of his new job. ""Being part of something is a blessing,"" he told ET. ""Since I joined Senate DJ I've felt like I belong to something and I'm not just out there on my own — I feel as if I'm part of a fraternity or brotherhood."" He explained that while he DJs sometimes, he finds that promotion ""is more rewarding both financially and emotionally."" Gosselin added, ""I like taking care of people and making others feel welcome."" Well, I guess you could say this new venture is just another way of taking care of people, sans pants.",2.5
413318,What Is Matcha - Green Tea Recipes,"Matcha is far from a new trend — it's been a part of Japanese and Chinese culture since at least the 12th century , long before the Western world had even sampled tea of any kind. Originally ground into a powder and compressed to allow it to travel distances, drinking matcha has been a highly formalized part of Japanese tea ceremonies. In recent decades, however, it's become a popular way to flavor drinks and snacks in Asia, making the green tea easier to enjoy casually and even on-the-go. The trend has been taking off in the U.S. in the last couple years as well, with some in Japan hoping that it will eventually become a staple in the American diet. While that might seem far-fetched, one expert notes that a similar trend after World War II — soy sauce —has become a permanent pantry item in many Americans pantries. So if you've never experienced matcha's bitter, addictive flavor (or if you've only had it at a restaurant), there's no better time to start experimenting with it in your own kitchen. Here are eight recipes to allow you to experience matcha in its many delicious forms. Matcha Truffles Traditionally, matcha desserts or baked goods aren't very sweet, making this truffle recipe a perfect way to enjoy its green tea flavor without overpowering it with cloyingly sweet flavors. Matcha Mochi One of the first foods to be flavored with matcha powder, mochi's compulsively snackable taste and texture is a perfect pairing. Matcha Pistachio Ice Lollies Another frequent pairing, matcha and pistachio are the perfect summertime treat when turned into a popsicle. Iced Almond Milk Matcha Latte Unsweetened almond milk with just a touch of honey keeps the green tea flavor from being overpowered, all while still being served in a deliciously creamy format. Matcha Chia Pudding Matcha also has a reputation as a superfood because of high levels of antioxidants. While the benefits of antioxidants in our diet might be up for debate, there's something we do know for sure: matcha is also caffeinated, making it a fun addition to breakfast for that reason alone. Matcha Doughnuts Make your friends green with envy with this delicious dessert. (Or, you can share it with them — up to you.) Matcha Pancakes Japanese-style matcha pancakes are often thicker than the American ones we're used to, making it more cake-like in the process (and we're not complaining). Matcha Ginger Kombucha Fizz Another drink just recently gaining popularity in America, kombucha, pairs up with matcha for a one-of-a-kind cocktail.",5.0
415003,Reese Witherspoon Mom Celebrity Crush Charlie Hunnam,"Reese Witherspoon brought her mom with her to The Ellen DeGeneres Show, and the results are hilarious. The Big Little Lies star filmed an Instagram story of herself and her mom, Betty, on the way to the taping — and if the interview is half as funny as their car ride, we're in for a real treat. At first, Betty says she's looking forward to the show because she loves DeGeneres' dancing. Then her daughter asks if she can tell the host about Betty's celebrity crush. Betty is a little embarrassed at first, but eventually, she reveals her crush to Witherspoon's Instagram audience. Apparently, Mama Betty has a thing for Sons of Anarchy star Charlie Hunnam. The best part of the Instagram video, though, is when Witherspoon asks her mom why she likes Hunnam. ""Because he's King Arthur,"" Betty responds. ""And, you know, I'm Queen Elizabeth."" During the actual taping, Witherspoon gave her mom a shoutout, too. DeGeneres asked the cameras to pan over to Betty's place in the audience, before asking the actress about the ""inappropriate texts"" her mom apparently sends her. Witherspoon's been known to post some of the funnier ones on her Instagram account — check out one of her mom's BLL reactions below. Witherspoon also recounted a story in which her mom told an employee at the Apple Store, ""I keep all my nude selfies in the cloud."" And then, the conversation somehow turned to the origin of the dab. Check out the clip below.

416506,IFTTT’s powerful new initiative connects up with government data streams – TechCrunch,"Today, all around cool internet thing IFTTT is hooking all kinds of useful public data into its powerful platform. With the launch of its new Data Access Project, IFTTT will add support for a broad selection of government agencies, organizations and research and cultural groups. That includes public data from federal and state government feeds on down to municipal transit information. The new data streams have the potential to be all kinds of useful. In practice, that means every time there’s a relevant new SEC filing, your Hue lights can flash green (or red, depending). Or you can get a text every time the State Department posts a travel warning. Or a Slack notification each time the Department of Defense posts an update. Or lots of things — infinitely configurable things, really. Put simply, IFTTT lets you connect things to other things. It does this through easy to set up custom formulas, like “every time @techcrunch tweets, call my phone.” These logic statements, all take the form of “if x happens, do y,” hence the name If This Then That (IFTTT) . IFTTT used to call these formulas Recipes but now they’re calling them Applets, which is more confusing in our book but the functionality remains the same. IFTTT’s more than 40 new sources include: For IFTTT, the public data initiative stands to breathe some new life into a platform that in recent years is perhaps best known for letting you automate quirky things in your smart home. As a (really) long time IFTTT user, I have to say that it’s an exciting and potentially very useful new direction. I fully expect to lose hours configuring my own public data streams in the coming days. According to IFTTT CEO Linden Tibbets, the beauty of the service’s new direction is that it can help users organize yet another kind of information that might otherwise be overwhelming and put it to good use. “It’s not that the information isn’t out there — companies, governments, and institutions are releasing information all the time. But for the average person, it’s overwhelming,” said Tibbets. “We’ve built out services whose data impacts people in very real ways: governments, agencies, non-profits, transits, and other institutions. Now people can easily find, and use, that information in brand new ways. We’re excited to see the response, and plan to expand the Data Access Project with more services in the near future.” Apparently, this could be the tip of the iceberg for IFTTT’s foray into helping people harness the power of public information that’s already floating around. “People are hungry for public data, especially when it comes to staying on top of the news and government,” said Anne Mercogliano, IFTTT Vice President of Business Operations and Marketing. “Our IFTTT team kept seeing more and more amazing data resources out there and realized it was something we wanted to invest in and help build and bring onto the platform. We hope the Data Access Project is helpful for the average person, researcher, official and more.” Mercogliano notes that ProPublica’s IFTTT channel saw a significant boost in interest after November 8, 2016. And in March of this year, IFTTT launched a collection of “Applets for activism” that sought to tap into that same phenomenon. “Customizing your experience is at the heart of IFTTT and we want to ensure you’re getting all of the data you need but in a way that works for your lifestyle,” Mercogliano said. “The Data Access Project is an ongoing initiative for us and we’re looking for any government, local agency or nonprofit to be a part of our project.” Interested groups can contact IFTTT at dap@ifttt.com to get started.",3.5
420816,Forever 21 Urban Outfitters Tupac Shirts Copyright Suit,"It has not been a great week to be Forever 21. The retailer, along with Urban Outfitters, is heading to court after a celebrity photographer alleges they used his photos of Tupac Shakur on clothing without his permission. Photographer Danny Clinch filed the copyright infringement lawsuit in federal court in New York last week. The photos were from the 1993 and 1996 covers of Rolling Stone magazine. The suit reads, ""Defendants, without the authorization, knowledge or consent of the plaintiff, deliberately and willfully copied, displayed, distributed, and sold the copyrighted photographs on such infringing T-shirts and perhaps other apparel."" In this case, along with the two retailers, the defendants include Bioworld Merchandising (who produced the shirts), Planet Productions LLC (who licensed the shirts), and Amaru/AWA Merchandising, Inc. (the company in charge of licensing Tupac merchandise). According to The Consumerist, it appears that Amaru/AWA Merchandising Inc. granted Planet Productions permission to use the images on behalf of the copyright holder. Clinch is the copyright holder of the images, but he claims he never authorized Amaru/AWA to act on his behalf. Clinch is seeking $600,000 in damages, the destruction of any remaining shirts featuring his images, and an order prohibiting the companies from using the images in the future. This is the second time in as many weeks that Forever 21 is feeling the wrath of a celebrity. Frank Ocean took to Tumblr to express shock that a font that was potentially designed specifically for him appeared on the doors of a Forever 21 store. However, typefaces aren't considered intellectual property and Ocean likely wouldn't have a case in court. That said, it's not a great look for the retailer. Both Forever 21 and Urban Outfitters have been at the center of copyright infringement lawsuits in the past, and have been accused many times over of stealing work from other artists. Last year, Urban Outfitters finally settled its years-long lawsuit with the Navajo Nation. Ironically, earlier this year, Forever 21 filed a lawsuit of its own accusing other retailers of co-opting its designs. Read These Stories Next: Did You Know That Zara Has A Cheaper Sister Brand?

421303,Report: Microsoft may buy cloud monitoring startup Cloudyn for $50M-70M – TechCrunch,"The consolidation of smaller cloud services through acquisitions by larger could platforms has been a running theme in the enterprise world for a while, and this morning we got a glimpse of what might be the latest development on that front. Israeli publication Calcalist is reporting that Microsoft is in talks to acquire Cloudyn — startup founded in Tel Aviv that monitors and optimizes a company’s cloud storage across multiple vendors — for a price of between $50 million and $70 million. We’ve reached out to both Cloudyn and Microsoft for comment and have received nearly identical replies in response: “No comment at this time” from a Microsoft spokesperson, and “At this time, no comment,” from Cloudyn’s spokesperson. Separately, a source close to the situation tells TechCrunch that nothing has been signed so that’s a signal that things could shift, or not happen at all. To date, Cloudyn, which was founded in 2011, has raised $20.5 million, according to Crunchbase, from investors that include Carmel Ventures, Infosys and Russia’s Titanium (Calcalist notes a higher funding figure of $22.5 million). This means a $50 million to $70 million price tag is at least more than double, or nearly four times the money raised, and a 10x multiple on revenues, which Calcalist reports at between $5 million and $7 million a year. To note, there are other competitors in the same area as Cloudyn, including CloudCheckr, CloudHealth Technologies and RightScale. These three have each raised between twice and three times as much as Cloudyn. Microsoft is one of the biggest players in cloud services by way of its Azure business, which competes against the likes of AWS from Amazon and Google Cloud, amongst many others, vying for business from companies who use the platforms not just for storage, but also to run apps and other services. As network connectivity has become cheaper and faster, and mobile devices with strong computing power but less storage have become the norm, cloud services have exploded. Cloudyn, in this context, is an interesting business because it has positioned itself as an agnostic but intelligent companion to how businesses are actually using cloud services today. In many cases, we are seeing hybrid deployments spanning both cloud and on-premises offerings, as well as businesses that are using cloud services from a range of providers. (As one notable example, you might remember a story from last year about Apple signing on for “some” services with Google, although still using AWS and Azure for others.) As we have written previously about Cloudyn, the company’s dashboard not only allows companies to monitor how services are being used, but also to optimize this, including increasing capacity when needed. If this deal happens, it will be worth watching how Microsoft implements it. Obviously, the company has a strong mandate in increasing the amount of business on its Azure platform, which has been growing at a steady pace — revenues for the division last quarter were up 93 percent and compute usage more than doubled, with the annualized run rate at $14 billion. But more significantly, Microsoft has been making a push to promote the idea of multiplatform services — the message being: Microsoft will be there for you, wherever you happen to be. (See Microsoft’s app strategy across different operating systems as another example of this, or how the company has implemented Teams, its collaboration product, which clearly favors Microsoft software but does not play in an exclusively walled garden, since many companies do not.) It is here that Cloudyn could be a more useful addition to the Microsoft portfolio: a way to help Microsoft’s customers monitor how their services are working in the cloud, while perhaps in the process also giving Microsoft’s own services a helpful nudge in the mix. It helps, too, that Cloudyn itself has been amassing a large client list itself. The company says that it works with “thousands” of companies, including “Fortune 500 leaders in all major industry verticals.” Notably, Cloudyn also is already a Microsoft partner. In March of this year, it announced support for Microsoft Cloud Solution Providers — that is, integrators and other in-the-middle services providers who sit between Azure (or other cloud providers) and enterprises and manage and monitor usage on those platforms on their behalf, perhaps tied to a specific product at the business that the integrator has implemented. Infosys (which, again, invests in Cloudyn), Westcon-Comstor and Insight are already customers. There have been a number of other acquisitions in the cloud services space of smaller startups by larger platforms as they continue to build out the services that they are offering to customers to increase what can be quite thin margins, and to make services more sticky. Amazon’s AWS, for example, has acquired several companies in the last year, including Harvest.ai, Do.com, Biba and Thinkbox, all to expand what it can offer to businesses on its cloud platform. Other acquisitions that Microsoft has made in Israel include enterprise security firms Aorato, Adallom and Secure Islands.",3.5

425433,Bad First Date Couple's Way We Met Instagram Story,"How easy is it to recover from a bad first date? Or, rather, a bad first date that turns into worse dates? For this couple, it only took a six-month break and another chance at a first date. Of course, it also helped that their mothers had been friends for almost 40 years. In a submission to The Way We Met's Instagram page, a woman named Shaween wrote about how she and her now-husband, Aree, began their relationship. Though their mothers met each other in school when they were both 14, Shaween and Aree didn't meet until nearly 40 years later, at a party in London. ""I was instantly attracted to Aree,"" she wrote. ""After chatting with him, I went up to my mum and said, 'I just met my future husband.'"" Unfortunately, their first date didn't necessarily reflect that chemistry. ""I think because our mums are so close, we were both very hesitant in our approach and weren't being ourselves,"" she wrote. ""He was being careful not to do anything that I would go and complain to my mum about and vice versa."" The dates ""went from bad to worse"" until the two of them decided to call it quits and remain friends. ""It was only once the pressure was completely off that we both started being our true selves and forming a real connection,"" she wrote. ""We talked almost daily for 6 months as just friends until he asked me if I'd be willing to give it another go. I said yes and figured one more date couldn't hurt."" It ended up paying off: ""Our first date the second time around was the best day,"" she wrote. And as you can see from the photo she attached, the rest of their dates seemed to go pretty well, too. It just goes to show that while giving a relationship another shot isn't always the best idea, sometimes second chances are worth it.

428103,Casual Sex No Strings Attached Honest Dating Tips,"My dating life followed a very specific pattern in my early 20s. I’d meet a guy, we’d go out, have a good time, go out a second time, a third, and then I’d get the line. “I’m not interested in a serious relationship,” he’d say. “I’m just looking for something casual.” But that’s not what I’d hear. The personal translator who used to reside in my brain would listen to those words, and then rejigger them to fit what I wanted to hear: I know I’m saying I just want to hook up at the moment, but if you stick around long enough, I’ll realize that you’re perfect for me — and we’ll live happily ever after, just like in all those romantic comedies your mother loves. So, baby Maria would stick around, expecting a deeper connection to form, only to be left crushed a month later when (surprise!) the guy still only wanted to have sex. It was like I was on a hamster wheel. I’d repeat the same pattern, hear some form of the same line, over and over again. And yet I’d still willingly fall into flings with these guys. After about a half-dozen such romances, I’d finally had enough. “People who just want casual sex are so selfish!” I cried to my friends over cocktails one night. Their heads bobbed in agreement. They, too, had been dealing with paramours on the prowl for no-strings sex. And frankly, we were sick of it. But, ever the optimist, I continued to date, wary of guys who would tell me they just wanted casual sex right off the bat. One Friday night, I’d double-booked myself on two dates. I was meant to have early drinks with bachelor number one, followed by a casual cocktails-and-appetizers date with bachelor number two. When I got to the bar to meet my first date, I spotted a really attractive, broody guy in the corner, scribbling in a notebook. My date turned out to be a total dud, but writer guy and I kept making eyes. After just one drink, I told the dude I was with that I had to go, put him in a cab, and then sent off a text to my second date, faking a headache. I marched back into the bar, sat down next to writer guy, and ordered myself a drink. His name was Will*, and he was a theater actor with a side hustle as a carpenter, and a slight Texan drawl. He was taking notes for a play he was writing. We immediately bonded over our love of cheap beer, theater, and Johnny Cash. For the next five hours, the booze flowed; we moved to another bar, split a plate of nachos, and then drunkenly fell into a cab together back to my apartment. It was my first experience with casual sex like that — and I was surprised by how into it I was. After my usual pattern had failed to land me a rom-com boyfriend, I’d decided to go in the opposite direction by taking a dating hiatus. I liked Will, but there was a lot about him that I didn’t want in a relationship. We continued to see one another, but we were explicit about keeping things casual. After trying our hand at a “real” date, Will and I realized our sizzle was at its highest within the four walls of my apartment. So we laid down some ground rules: we were allowed to date other people, so long as we were honest about it. And while we’d go out to shows and bars together, we agreed that we'd hang just as friends. Until we got back to my place, of course. But I still had so much fun with him. He'd come by on a Friday night, and we’d order Chinese food and watch old episodes of The Sopranos. He’d sing me Johnny Cash songs in a thick southern accent. He hung all of the shelves in my apartment, cooked me chicken and dumplings from scratch, and, real talk, was some of the best sex I’ve ever had. But, all good things come to an end. One day, Will told me that he’d met someone he was interested in pursuing seriously, but that he’d end things with her if I wanted to take our relationship to the next level. As much as I liked Will, I knew that there were a lot of ways in which we’d never work as a couple. The passion that made our sex so good also meant we bickered regularly. We got on each other’s nerves a lot; he drank all of my expensive scotch, and I hated the fact that he was a smoker. So, I encouraged him to go after the other girl. We had one more night together and then we parted ways. I was a little bummed, because I really enjoyed the arrangement that Will and I had set up. But it also opened my eyes to one pretty amazing fact: Casual sex can be a lot of fun if both parties are on board. Will knew that I was never going to change my mind when it came to a relationship with him, so he gracefully exited the situation instead of trying to change it. He didn’t tell me I was a bad person or that I was selfish. He knew casual sex was all that I could give at the moment, and when he started wanting something more, he walked away. Being on that side of the situation made me realize the tragic mistake I’d been making with men when I was younger. They’d told me exactly what they wanted in a relationship — to not be in one, basically — and they stuck to their guns. By projecting my own desires onto our situation rather than hearing and respecting what they had told me at the start, I was setting myself up for heartbreak. Every time. The problem wasn’t casual sex, or the fact that it’s what they wanted. The problem was me, and denial (and maybe rom-coms). There will absolutely be people in the game who won’t tell you that’s what they’re looking for, mislead and disappoint you, or who will say they want one thing when they actually want something else. But, like Maya Angelou said, “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.” If someone you're interested in says they just want casual sex, believe them. So, no — Will and I didn’t eventually fall in love. But we did start sleeping together casually again when we're both single, and he’s actually become a great friend. Now I know I can reach out to him when I need something, be it help spackling a hole in the wall or an orgasm. Will showed me who he was from the beginning — a funny guy I felt comfortable with who made delicious chicken and dumplings. And lucky for me, I believed him. *Name has been changed. After being raised on a steady diet of Disney movies, I expected to meet someone and fall passionately in love — but wound up collapsing under the pressures of modern dating. Luckily, I eventually realized that there's no ""right"" way to date, and that I need to find happiness within myself, no partner needed.

429353,Wind River Movie Native American Women Sad True Story,"Wind River opens on a landscape of white, of cold, of desolation. A pack of coyotes gaze apathetically at a herd of sheep so pale they blend into the Wyoming snow. At the moment every nature documentary has taught us to expect a coyote to lunge and walk away with its bleating lunch between its teeth, we hear a gunshot. The coyote lies in a puddle of red, a shocking smear of color on an otherwise monochromatic landscape. A professional animal tracker, Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner), is hired by farmers to protect livestock from prey. By patiently looking at tracks in the snow, Lambert can dispose of mountain lions and wolves. Less easy is catching the forces that prey on humans — forces like poverty, violence, lack of opportunity, grief, depression, suicide, drug addiction, and sexual assault that prey on almost every character on the American Indian reservation in which Wind River is set. While Lambert can’t use his tracking ability to destroy major sociological constraints, he does what he can. After tracking down a coyote, Lambert follows further tracks in the snow — this time, the tracks lead not to a predator but to a teenage girl, frozen in the icy landscape. As the autopsy shows, the girl had been raped, and then ran barefoot in the snow until her lungs filled with cold air and burst. Unfortunately, this is a scene Lambert is familiar with. He and his ex-wife, an American Indian from the Wind River reservation, lost their teenage daughter in much the same way four years prior. Lambert reports his findings back to the reservation’s law enforcement. There are no wails; there are no gasps of surprise. Rather, it seems dismay burrows further down into the wrinkles on the police chief’s face. For a young person to die on the Wind River reservation is not a shock — and that is the shocking part of the story. For the rest of the film, Lambert aids with rookie FBI agent Jane Banner’s (Elizabeth Olsen) efforts. Together they navigate a terrain of hardship and crime. Effectively, the murdered girl’s parents have lost two children. One, to violence. The other, as we see in detail when Lambert and Jane visit the victim's brother's isolated house, to drug addiction. I could wax poetic on Wind River’s cinematic virtues. It is a thriller that balances shock and suspense with emotional depth. Thanks to Tyler Sheridan’s script, Wind River’s characters speak dialogue so punchy and powerful you’ll remember their words days later — lines like, ""Luck don't live out here. Luck lives in the city."" Yet this piece of art also serves a purpose. What Tyler Sheridan’s film does so well is portray a forgotten community. “The social issues that Native Americans face are the same as in other parts of the country — domestic abuse, poverty, drug addiction, alcoholism — but on the reservation, no one is watching or listening,” Sheridan told Newsweek. In Wind River, you’ll be forced to watch, and you’ll be forced to listen. After all, as extreme and disturbing as the events depicted in Wind River are, they’re not fantastical. The plot was inspired by true events. The Wind River reservation first made news in 2012, when it was the subject of a New York Times expose. The size of Rhode Island and Delaware combined, Wind River is Wyoming’s only American Indian reservation. In spite of its beautiful name, the reservation is not something out of a fairy tale. On the Wind River reservation, life expectancy is 49 years. The unemployment rate is higher than 80%, and the high school dropout rate is 40% higher than the rest of Wyoming. By comparing Wind River to Iraq, where the life expectancy is 69, and to Zimbabwe, which shares Wind River’s unemployment rate, the article emphasizes just how differently the reservations’ 14,000 residents live compared to the rest of United States citizens. While Wind River may not state these statistics outright, you’ll feel them in the scenes of desperation, drug abuse, and especially in the crimes against women portrayed with such stark intensity. Sheridan says that he doesn’t want to “preach” to audiences. Yet the movie’s final words — “While missing person statistics are compiled for every other demographic, none exist for Native American women.” — are designed to haunt. Though Lambert and Jane eventually solve the crime in the film, it's no victory. We’re left knowing that most stories don’t end with the cold feat of revenge performed in Wind River. They’re left dangling, unsolved. Violence against American Indian women is endemic, on the Wind River reservation and beyond. According to a Department of Justice study, 84% of Native American and Alaskan Native women have experienced violence of some sort; 56% have experienced sexual violence. Wind River lifts these statistics off the page and animates them into an awful, striking, and completely unforgettable existence.

432267,Twitter moves to ban crypto ads – TechCrunch,"Twitter is the latest social service to boot out cryptocurrency advertisers. The company told Reuters it will be launching a new policy this week to prohibit the advertising of token sales/initial coin offerings (ICOs), and crypto wallet services. Ads for cryptocurrency exchanges will also be banned — with some limited exceptions. Facebook announced a ban in January, while Google said earlier this month that it will ban them from June. Twitter confirmed the policy change to us, providing the following statement: “We are committed to ensuring the safety of the Twitter community. As such, we have added a new policy for Twitter Ads relating to cryptocurrency. Under this new policy, the advertisement of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales will be prohibited globally.” “We will continue to iterate and improve upon this policy as the industry evolves,” it added — flagging its current restricted content policies around financial services. A company spokesperson told us it expects to update its ads policies page within the next hour. At the time of writing the page was last updated on August 30th 2017. Since then Twitter has faced criticism for hosting crypto ads on its platform at a time when concern over cryptocurrency-related scams and risks have been voiced by regulators around the world. As we wrote earlier this month, banning these sorts of adverts really is a no brainer at this stage — so it’s good to see it listening and rethinking its approach. Twitter has been taking some action to tackle crypto scams. Earlier this month we reported it had been suspending some users for soliciting crypto — in an apparent effort to crack down on scammers’ ability to use the platform. But, at the time, it was not keen to comment on its crypto ads policy — even though its existing ads policy prohibits unsafe and deceptive ads and/or ads that make misleading claims. As we said then a platform level ban on crypto advertising is just common sense — at least until the market is properly regulated. We understand Twitter’s new crypto ads policy will continue to be reviewed as the industry evolves. And while ICOs/token sale ads will be banned globally there’s some wiggle room for exchanges and wallet services — with only those provided by a public company listed on certain major stock markets allowed to buy Twitter ads. In certain market further restrictions may also apply — such as that exchanges must be regulated by an FSA to be allowed to purchase ads.",3.5
437181,"BMW, GM, Ford and Renault launch blockchain research group for automotive industry – TechCrunch","Car makers BMW, General Motors, Ford and Renault are the big names behind a new group announced today to explore the potential of the blockchain in the automotive and mobility space. MOBI — the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative — launches today with over 30 founding members that also include Bosch, Blockchain at Berkeley, Hyperledger, Fetch.ai, IBM and IOTA. The group has a fairly broad goal of making transportation “safer, more affordable, and more widely accessible using blockchain technology.” The blockchain has the undoubted potential to impact a range of industries. The distributed ledger component and smart contracts, in particular, could reshape the way organizations and products use and consume data. Along those lines, MOBI said its scope of focus varies from payments, data tracking, and supply management, to consumer finance and pricing, and more futuristic areas like autonomous vehicles and ride-sharing systems. It isn’t the first time automotive firms have looked at the blockchain. Toyota is already doing its own research, Renault has joined the R3 research consortium, and Daimler is part of the Hyperledger project from the Linux Foundation. With MOBI, however, the group is focusing entirely on the automotive space and potential use cases rather than automotive as one of a number of industries. “Blockchain and related trust enhancing technologies are poised to redefine the automotive industry and how consumers purchase, insure and use vehicles,” Chris Ballinger, who is MOBI’s first chairman and CEO, said in a statement. “By bringing together automakers, suppliers, startups, and government agencies, we can accelerate adoption for the benefit of businesses, consumers and communities,” added Ballinger, who was formerly CFO and director of mobility services at the Toyota Research Institute . Members of the organization’s board include Joseph Lubin, founder of ConsenSys and a co-founder of Ethereum, and Brian Behlendorf, executive director of Hyperledger .

437260,British PM targets finance industry for failing to promote women,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May criticized Britain’s finance industry for failing to promote and retain women on Tuesday as the government revealed that some of the biggest players have committed to having at least 30 percent in senior roles by 2021. The Treasury said that for every pound earned by a man in the male-dominated financial services industry - the highest paid sector in Britain - a woman earns just over 60 pence, while women account for only 23 percent of boards and 14 percent of executive committees. “The UK is a world-leader in financial services, but the sector could do even better if it made the most of many talented women who work in finance. Too few women get to the top and many don’t progress as quickly as they should or they leave the sector completely,” May said in a statement. At the current pace of change it would take 30 years for women to attain just 30 percent of the seats on executive committees - the level at which research suggests a minority’s voice can be heard, a report by Oliver Wyman found. May became only the second female British prime minister after Margaret Thatcher in July following David Cameron’s departure as Conservative party leader in the aftermath of the country’s surprise vote to leave the European Union. She has since taken aim at the British establishment as she seeks to show she understands the frustrations of many voters which showed through in the June 23 referendum result. Major British banks have been widely unpopular in Britain because of the role they played in the financial crisis. May’s predecessor launched the Women in Finance Charter in March following a review of how to get more women into senior financial services roles. This was led by Virgin Money Chief Executive Jayne-Anne Gadhia, one of the most high-profile women in the sector. Her review recommended that internal targets be set for gender diversity in senior management, that pay packages be linked to a firm’s gender balance, that companies appoint an executive responsible for gender, diversity and inclusion, and that companies report gender statistics publicly. By July, 72 financial firms had signed up to the initiative, but no formal targets or quotas were announced. While 60 of these have committed to a 30 percent target, including HSBC, RBS and Lloyds, only 13, including the Financial Conduct Authority, Virgin Money and Legal and General, are aiming for a 50/50 split. Of the signatory firms, 20 named their CEO as the senior executive accountable for progress against their targets, the Treasury said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that the next group to sign up to the charter will be announced in November. While Britain has opted for voluntary targets, other countries have adopted quotas to ensure gender balance across business, not just finance. Of the 12 largest countries in Europe, five have mandatory quotas for female board representation: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Norway, according to a European Women on Boards study in April. This report also said that countries where mandatory quotas on board gender diversity at listed companies were introduced between 2011 and 2015 tended to experience high levels of growth in the percentage of women on boards over this period. However, Britain dropped from sixth to eighth place in the ranking of female board representation, according to the study, while Norway ranked first with 39 percent of board seats held by women, compared to 23 percent for Britain.

441391,"Contentsquare, the digital experience insights platform, raises $60M Series C – TechCrunch","Contentsquare, the cloud-based software that helps businesses understand how and why users are interacting with their app, mobile and web sites, has raised $60 million in further funding. Leading the Series C round is global investment company Eurazeo. It adds to $42 million in Series B funding raised around a year ago, and includes participation from existing investors Canaan, Highland Europe and H14. Described as a “fully automated digital experience insights platform,” Contentsquare’s SaaS analyses customer behavior through the tracking of “billions of digital touch and mouse movements” to provide brands with insights into how to increase engagement, reduce operational costs and maximise conversion rates. In other words, Contentsquare claims it can tell a company why conversion rates are low and, most importantly, what can be done to improve them. This can include making changes to specific page or content elements, or a combination of the two. Related to this, Contentsquare has developed an AI engine to analyse behavioural data and offer automatic insights. In addition, the “AutoZone” feature replaces content tagging and tag configuration with automatic element identification. This means that Contentsquare automatically recognises different page or app elements and can therefore track changes more easily to feed into the aforementioned AI engine. More recently, the company has released two new solutions for customers: CS Live and AI Alerts, which deliver customer experience information in real time. CS Live provides Contentsquare’s clients with a way to immediately identify consumer metrics on their websites without the need for a dashboard. AI Alerts, Contentsquare’s newest monitoring system, enables businesses to “detect and react to improve customer engagement without manual effort.” To that end, Contentsquare is used by digital, content, product, analytics, acquisition, IT and UX teams inside numerous companies. Its customers include Walmart, Samsung, Sephora, Tiffany, LVMH, AccorHotels, Goldman Sachs, Avis, GoPro, Ikea, Nissan and others. Meanwhile, Contentsquare says the new capital will help Contentsquare increase research and development focused on AI and predictive analytics. It also will be deployed for further expansion across the Americas, Europe, Asia and Middle East.",4.0
443167,Dollar index firmer as volumes thin ahead of holidays,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose on Friday as Republican negotiators in the U.S. Congress put the finishing touches on a sweeping tax overhaul, raising expectations that the bill would be passed by year-end. Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters that Republicans on the House-Senate negotiating committee working on the revamped bill had signed the finished product and the details would be published when the full House convenes at 5:30 p.m. EST (2230 GMT). It comes after two Republicans sought changes to the proposed legislation. “People will be eyeing up the U.S. tax plan. There are expectations building they could have it done by next week, if not that pushes if off until next year,” said Mark McCormick, North American head of foreign exchange strategy at TD Securities in Toronto. The tax bill needs a simple majority to pass in the Senate, in which Republicans hold just 52 of the 100 seats, and no Democrats are expected to support it. The dollar index .DXY against a basket of six major currencies rose 0.49 percent to 93.944. Many investors expect that the tax overhaul may boost U.S. growth, leading to more interest rate hikes and a higher dollar. Tax legislation is seen as the last major event this year as investors wind down trading activity before the Christmas and New Year holidays. “Markets are really consolidating at this point into holiday trading,” McCormick said. The cost for banks to borrow short-term dollar funds from other banks, meanwhile, surged to its highest level since 2012 as financial institutions scrambled to secure funding before thinning trading volumes. The cross currency basis swap “is moving in the U.S. direction as people seek funding to cover them through the end of the year,” said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. The three-month euro-dollar cross currency basis swap EURCBS3M=ICAP, which measures the premium banks have to pay to swap euros into dollars, traded at 100 basis points. It has widened from under minus 52 basis points at the beginning of the month. The rising swap cost was not yet seen impacting the greenback, though it could be negative for the dollar, said Chandler. “It’s very expensive for Europeans, say financial institutions, to buy Treasuries ... so it’s going to deter people from buying Treasuries and its going to encourage dollar-based investors to invest overseas,” Chandler said.

444703,Lena Dunham Responds Hateful Rape Lie Comment Instagram,"I will never understand the amount of hate that exists on the internet, nor why Girls creator Lena Dunham receives so much of it. However, there's one thing that Dunham will not allow her online trolls to do, and that's shame her into silence — which is exactly what one troll attempted to do when he alleged that she had ""made up"" her rape allegation. The actress, writer, and Lenny Letter co-founder published her memoir Not That Kind Of Girl in 2014, in which she described being raped by a classmate at Oberlin College. In February of 2017, the HBO star wrote a moving essay about what it means to be a sexual assault survivor, which was published in Lenny Letter. Dunham recently came out in support of the dozens of women who alleged movie mogul Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed them, posting a note on Instagram stating the report was ""horrifying."" Her apparent advocacy for other survivors was what led one troll to claim that Dunham had lied about her own rape. ""You made up a rape story,"" said the unnamed troll in Dunham's Instagram comments. Dunham shared a screenshot of the comment, then wrote a powerful message in the caption of the post. Sadly, Dunham stated, this kind of comment was hardly new. ""This is what my social media mentions are like every day. I've gotten used to it, I keep moving and I consider these people sad leftovers from a bygone era when female sexuality was caged and these pathetic basement dwellers were the gatekeepers,"" Dunham wrote on Instagram. She continued: ""But this week, as so many brave women/people come forward with stories of assault, I want you all to remember what they are facing: yes, some gorgeous applause and sisterhood. I wish I could focus only on that. But also a lot of surprising and cruel reactions by people who don't deserve the publicity."" She added that survivors face a particularly difficult road when discussing their past assaults. ""When I disclosed my rape 3 years ago I was ignorant- I assumed (despite having been in the eye of the storm before) that you share a painful story and people say 'hey, we may not agree on everything but fuck I hate that this happened to you.' That isn't often the experience of coming forward with assault, which is why I am endlessly and eternally proud of the women who have spoken up, those I know and those I don't. All love. This is just the beginning."" Dunham tackled rape culture in the final season of Girls. In the episode ""American Bitch,"" her character, Hannah, met with an author accused of sexual assault to discuss the allegations against him, only to be pressured into a sexual encounter.

444768,"Fear Of Clowns Scary Reasons, Halloween 2016 Attacks","This article was originally published on October 26, 2016. Americans don’t need presidential hopefuls to tell us what to be afraid of — we are already terrified, and we have been for months. The epidemic that started in South Carolina in August has now spread all over the country. The true horror of our day and age? Clowns. One Georgia girl brought a knife to school to protect herself; police in New York City have urged residents to stay calm; even Ronald McDonald is laying low for a while. We’ve seen clowns lurking outside homes after dark, trying to lure kids into the woods, just being creepy in public or intruding on our lives in random ways. Last week, all of this prompted an actual response from Randy Christensen, the president of the World Clown Association (yes, that exists): “We believe the art of clown is something to be treasured and enjoyed by audiences worldwide. We bring a happy, joyful, creative, caring, positive, and fun experience to our audiences,” the statement reads. “We stand with our safety officers who call for an end to the traumatization of individuals and communities. Anyone making a threat of violence should be arrested, whether this person is wearing a mask or not. This clearly is not the act of a professional clown.” This actually isn’t the first time we’ve been spooked by a creepy clown epidemic. Waves of evil clown sightings have in fact swept the country periodically since 1981. And obviously there’s It, and that one episode of Are You Afraid Of The Dark that will haunt ‘90s kids forever. But, for the most part, clowns are goofy and kind to children and exist to bring joy into the world — so, what is it about clowns exactly that is so unsettling? Part of it is that our brains simply don’t know how to process clowns. Earlier this year, the first-ever psychological study of creepiness found that unpredictability is one of its main components. And this makes perfect sense when applied to clowns: A clown may present as jolly and fun, but we can’t predict his behavior — or whether we’ll be his next target. (Anyone who’s been to the circus and knows the particular terror of being pulled from the audience to participate knows this is true, even of “nice” clowns.) According to Benjamin Radford, author of Bad Clowns and research fellow at the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, we actually have clowns all wrong from the start. “People who aren't really familiar with the cultural history of the clown think, ‘Oh wow, Stephen King made this thing evil,’” he says. “No, you were mistaken for thinking it was good!” The original clown was never cheery or safe, Radford says. Think of court jesters, the only people who could make fun of the king, or mythic trickster figures and devils. For hundreds of years in England, children and adults alike have enjoyed the Punch and Judy puppet shows, featuring Mr. Punch, “this nasty, evil, hook-nosed, red-capped malcontent [who] beats his wife with a bat and throws his baby out the window because he's crying.” At its heart, the clown is all about contradictions and crossing boundaries, and that both thrills and unnerves us. Also, there’s the ambiguity of how clowns look. “With a clown, we know rationally that the person underneath that makeup is a person, and yet, that person is in many ways inhuman,” Radford says. “They have these characteristics that are exaggerated and grotesque and caricatured — their faces are too big, their hair is too big, their glasses are too small, their props are oversize. They oftentimes have sort of quasi-supernatural powers. They're not quite like us: They have roses that will squirt water, they can fit 15 of their friends in a tiny car, they can fall off a ladder and not get hurt.” All of this together can be paralyzing, as our brains struggle to slot the clown into an easily definable category, such as “safe” or “dangerous,” “good” or “bad.” Americans’ beliefs about what is possible in the world only complicate things. According to the most recent Chapman University Survey of American Fears, in 2015, about half of Americans believed in the likelihood of the paranormal. Nearly half agreed or strongly agreed that spirits can or do haunt the physical realm. An evil, supernatural clown isn’t a big leap from there. And of course, a setting where you’re not expecting to see a clown — as in outside your door randomly or in the woods behind your house — adds another layer of spookiness. “If you come upon a single clown somewhere, and they see you, you are forced into their world,” Radford says. “You are unwillingly drawn into whatever the hell they're going to do. That's a line that real clowns don't cross, but these sort of prankster clowns do.” The original clown scares of the 1980s spread in part thanks to a public primed for “stranger danger.” With an especially stressful election season this year, in addition to increased access and exposure to bad news worldwide, Radford urges all of us to look at clown stories logically. “I would just encourage people to step back, take a breather and just realize that the creepy clowns in their imaginations are far worse than the hoaxsters and pranksters and copycats and legends that are in the news today.”",4.0
446046,Apple proposes new emojis to represent people with disabilities – TechCrunch,"Apple has proposed a number of emojis to the Unicode Consortium, the emoji gatekeeper of sorts, to better represent people with disabilities and depict accessibility-related tools like hearing aids, guide dogs and prosthetic limbs. That’s because Apple is unable to include these emojis in iOS and Mac OS until the Consortium adopts them. The proposed emojis depict people who experience blindness or low-vision, those who experience deafness or have trouble hearing, those with physical disabilities, as well as those with hidden disabilities like Autism, anxiety and PTSD. Here are the proposed emojis: [gallery ids=""1611289,1611290,1611291,1611292,1611293,1611294,1611295,1611296,1611297,1611298,1611299,1611300,1611301""] “At Apple, we believe that technology should be accessible to everyone and should provide an experience that serves individual needs,” the company wrote in a proposal to the Unicode Consortium. “Adding emoji emblematic to users’ life experiences helps foster a diverse culture that is inclusive of disability. Emoji are a universal language and a powerful tool for communication, as well as a form of self-expression, and can be used not only to represent one’s own personal experience, but also to show support for a loved one.” In order to develop these proposed emojis, Apple worked with the American Council of the Blind, Cerebral Palsy Foundation and National Association for the Deaf. What Apple put forward is not a comprehensive list of all the possible depictions of people with disabilities, the company noted in its proposal, but it could serve as a starting point. The next step is for the Unicode Technical Committee to meet up and vote on whether to approve these new emojis. That meeting happens next month. If approved, those characters would get shortlisted for Emoji 12.0, which is scheduled for a March 2019 release.

453378,Marshall introduces its own Wi-Fi multi-room speaker system – TechCrunch,"It seems like everyone these days has a multi-room speaker system – the latest entrant is Marshall, the amp maker that brought its signature style to portable consumer speakers in recent years. The speaker maker is introducing three new models today, each of which packs Wi-Fi connectivity and multi-room capabilities. The Acton, Stanmore and Woburn multi-room models go up in size from compact to quite large, and each resembles the classic vintage Marshall amp styling that the company is known for. The Acton is $350, the Stanmore is $450 and the Woburn is $600, and features two 5.25-inch woofers along with 110 watts of output power. Each of these speakers support Chromecast out of the box, as well as Spotify Connect and AirPlay so you’re covered regardless of which devices or music service you want to use. That means you can add them to an existing Chromecast-based multi-room audio setup, too, which is great news for anyone already working with Google Home or Chromecast hardware.

Presets correspond to dial options on the speakers themselves, which allow you to set immediate access to streaming of favorite (or hated, I’m not here to judge) artists, playlists and albums. Many speaker makers now offer similar systems, including Sony, Brookstone and more, but Marshall’s distinct style is likely to be an added draw for some.

The mother of two took to Twitter Tuesday morning to reveal that her youngest, Saint West, was recently hospitalized for pneumonia, ultimately spending three days in the hospital. ""My precious baby boy is so strong!"" she wrote. ""After spending three nights in the hospital & seeing my baby get multiple IV’s and hooked up to oxygen machines, our end of year was challenging. Pneumonia is so scary."" She followed up the announcement by thanking not just the doctors and nurses who helped Saint, but those all over who dedicate their lives to helping people.

He’s so resilient I’m sure he will still say the ambulance ride was cool! My strong Saint,"" she concluded. Motherhood has been a pretty big theme with the Kardashians this past month. Before Saint's illness, Khloé Kardashian finally confirmed her long-rumored pregnancy with an Instagram post. ""My greatest dream realized! We are having a baby!"" the heartfelt post began, going on to say that ""I know we've been keeping this quiet but we wanted to enjoy this between our family and close friends as long as we could privately.""

461180,Nina Simone And Sister Rosetta Tharpe Honored Rock Hall,"In Indio, CA on Saturday night, Beyoncé took a minute during her historical moment as the first Black female headliner of Coachella to pay tribute to a pioneer who came before her, the great Nina Simone. Her timing was perfect: on the night that Simone was finally getting her moment to shine as an inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. That, too, involved an earth-shaking performance by another legend, Lauryn Hill. Or so we hear; in the era of livestreamed everything, the Rock Hall is almost quaint in its insistence on taping its induction ceremony to air later (May 5) on HBO. But the reports, highlight clips, and a few Twitter and Instagram videos coming out of the Public Auditorium were enough to give us secondhand chills. ""Her voice was so distinctive and warm and powerful, I never heard anything like it,"" Mary J. Blige as she inducted Nina Simone, the singer dubbed the High Priestess of Soul but whose music spanned so many more genres, into the hall. When Simone's brother, Sam Waymon, accepted the long overdue trophy for his sister, who died in 2003, he was reportedly given a time limit for his speech, but went over it, knowing she deserved much more than the three minutes the Rock Hall allegedly allotted. Yes, her voice was distinctive — you can often identify it with just one note — but there were two women on the stage Sunday night who used their own distinct voices to honor her. Backed by The Roots and buoyed by an impressive beehive of hair, Andra Day sang Simone's versions of ""I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free"" and ""I Put a Spell On You,"" according to Cleveland.com. ""She is probably one of my biggest inspirations and why I do music,"" Day told the Rock Hall's red carpet correspondent Carrie Keagan before the ceremony. ""A lot of her lyrics and her songs are unfortunately still relevant, but fortunately we have her entire pantheon of music to encourage us and inspire us."" Cleveland.com reported earlier on Saturday that Hill would appear, but the news was still not official until the moment she took the stage. Hill began with a cover of ""Ne Me Quitte Pas,"" transitioned into ""Black Is The Color of My True Love's Hair"" (which included some rapping), and finished with ""Feeling Good."" Hill's outfit — a voluminous purple chiffon ball gown skirt, black and white feathered top, and green and pink headscarf — befitted her dramatic delivery. Simone herself was usually given to more understated gowns for her own appearances, but the headscarf appeared to be an homage to the elegant, Afrocentric hairstyles she favored. Simone was not the only black female legend honored on Saturday. Earlier in the night, Alabama Shakes singer Brittany Howard inducted blues-gospel singer and guitarist Sister Rosetta Tharpe. In the Rock Hall's 25-year history, by our count this is only the 11th year in which more than one woman made the inductee list. (There have been several years with no female inductees at all, including as recently as 2016.) According to The Fader, 87% of the Hall’s inductees are men or bands led by men. Many credit Tharpe with introducing guitar to rock ‘n’ roll, and when you read the list of white male artists who said her sound influenced them — Elvis Presley, Eric Clapton, Johnny Cash, Keith Richards — it should be astonishing she isn't more well-known today. Well, it would be astonishing if we weren't already numb to the way these histories get rewritten in every field. Tharpe recorded her biggest hits in the 1930s, but performed until her death in 1970. On the red carpet Questlove said he has been lobbying to get Tharpe inducted into the hall for ""at least 12 years."" ""She broke all the rules,"" Howard said on the red carpet. ""She played from the souls of her feet to the top of her head."" The Roots accompanied Howard for ""Strange Things Happening Every Day,"" and singer-guitarist Felicia Collins took the mic for ""That's All."" Paul Shaffer joined in on piano, too, according to Rolling Stone. Oh, and you may have heard there were a few men around to be inducted too — the Moody Blues, Dire Straits, the Cars, and yes, Bon Jovi, who took up over an hour of the ceremony with speeches and performances. Fans and rock critics have made much about the times the New Jersey rockers were passed over for their induction. This kind of talk took up much of the air in the week leading up to the ceremony — which, to be fair, two deceased women have a hard time doing their own press. But here’s a little perspective on the rockers’ complaints of being overlooked: Bon Jovi have been eligible since 2008 (25 years after their first commercial recording). Nina Simone hit that milestone in 1983. One woman who did receive the honor earlier in this decade, Heart’s Ann Wilson, was on hand for two special moments in the show. She was officially their to induct her friends, the Moody Blues, but the Seattle musician (along with Alice in Chains' Jerry Cantrell) was also the perfect choice to perform covered “Black Hole Sun” in memory of Chris Cornell. You're doing better, Rock Hall, but next year, try adding more of these ladies to your list!",4.0
465867,Salesforce officially walks away from Twitter acquisition for real this time – TechCrunch,"Salesforce wants to make things super clear for everyone — no, the company won’t buy Twitter. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff gave an interview to the FT and said that the company ruled out the acquisition. “In this case we’ve walked away. It wasn’t the right fit for us,” Benioff told the FT. If you were looking for an official confirmation, it can’t get more official than that. Two weeks ago, nearly all suitors announced at the same time that they weren’t interested by Twitter after all. Google, Apple and Disney don’t want to buy Twitter anymore. Salesforce was the last remaining suitor. While the company could have used this opportunity to lower the acquisition price, it wasn’t the case. During an investor meeting, Benioff already said that Twitter wasn’t the right fit for Salesforce. He even ended up saying “I wish Jack very well.” But many thought Benioff was quite excited about the idea of buying Twitter. So what happened exactly? Salesforce’s largest shareholder Fidelity Investments was against the deal. And given that Fidelity owns 14 percent of Salesforce, it would have been hard to buy Twitter with the board’s approval. This is probably the wisest decision for Benioff. Following the FT’s interview, Twitter shares are crashing once again. Shares are down 6.86 percent to $16.57. Twitter’s market cap is now $11.6 billion.",3.5
466305,French government dampens Corsican nationalists' autonomy hopes,"PARIS (Reuters) - France’s government on Tuesday ruled out major concessions towards autonomy sought by Corsica’s nationalists after they won a regional election, but said it was open to talks that took account of the island’s distinctive character. The nationalists on Sunday won two thirds of the seats in the new regional council that takes office on Jan. 1. Their ambitions are relatively modest among the wave of secessionist movements that have sprung up in parts of Europe as its traditional political forces have lost traction. Unlike Catalonia’s nationalists, they do not target outright independence, but they do seek official status for the Corsican language and a greater say on fiscal issues. Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said there were Corsican “specifics” to be taken into account in the discussions that Paris holds with all new regional authorities. “(But) let’s be clear ... this was not a referendum or a vote on autonomy or independence,” he told France 2 TV. The Corsican nationalists also want to be able to decide who can buy properties and they seek liberty for those they call political prisoners, who have been condemned for attacks or are awaiting judgment. The sun-drenched island, the birthplace of Napoleon and known as much over recent decades for its sometimes violent independence movements as for its stunning landscapes, has long been a thorn in the side of French governments. Clandestine group the National Front for the Liberation of Corsica (FLNC) laid down its weapons in 2014 after a near four-decade long rebellion, in a major shift that helped boost the popularity of the moderate nationalists who won Sunday’s election. Asked about prisoners, Griveaux said: “The law must be respected. When there have been crimes and a court ruling, when people have been condemned, the sentence should be carried out.” Asked about Corsican becoming an official language on the island alongside French, Griveaux said provision had already been made in various regions to allow the use of a local language, for instance in some schools. But “the language of the Republic is French,” he added. Political analyst Andre Fazi, a lecturer at the University of Corsica, said it would be hard for the nationalists to get what they wanted. “But with Sunday’s election win, it would also be risky for the government to not do anything,” he said. “Shutting the door completely could boost calls for outright independence, as was the case in Catalonia.” In a sign that the government might be taking this into account, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Sunday called nationalist leader Gilles Simeoni to congratulate him on his win and told him he was willing to see him soon in Paris.

471667,"Skype gets new bots for travel, tickets and entertainment, but they’re far from perfect – TechCrunch","Following yesterday’s launch of a new version of the Skype Windows 10 application, Microsoft today announced an expanded collection of its “Skype bots,” the automated chat assistants that it introduced earlier this year in a limited preview. The new bots include those that can help you make travel arrangements, locate event tickets, pull in information from other applications and services and even keep you entertained. In case you missed it this spring, Microsoft first demoed its Skype bots and bot platform at its annual BUILD conference, showing off how Skype users could interact with virtual assistants who could perform a variety of tasks, ranging from booking travel accommodations to adding items to your calendar or even pre-populating conversations with text to save you time on typing. But the early group of bots that launched were much simpler: a few Bing-related bots could pull in information from the search engine, while others focused on doing things like summarizing web pages or locating images. Handy, sure, but not to-die-for. Today’s expansion of the bots collection gets a step closer to delivering on the promise of bots that could truly shoulder some of the work we all have to do. For example, the Skyscanner Bot lets you search for individual or group flights, return pricing information and route options. Then, it will provide a link where users can go to complete the booking. This is not the first “bot-like” experience Skyscanner has developed, we should also note — the company was the first to build a voice search tool for Amazon’s Alexa, and more recently launched a travel companion bot for Skype’s messaging rival Facebook Messenger. Another travel bot comes from Hipmunk, which offers not only flight info, but also hotel and other general travel advice based on your specific preferences, like price, vacation theme or the amount of “travel agony” you’re willing to tolerate. (Minimizing agony by helping users avoid things like layovers or finding shorter flights is Hipmunk’s claim to fame.) This works fairly well, as you can swipe through different options to see different flight details or create fare alerts, and more. The bot also suggested hotel options when I searched for a flight, even though I didn’t ask. (You might find this feature either helpful or annoying.) And a final panel lets you click for more travel information and advice, which you ask of the bot itself (e.g. “best time to fly between X and Y,” “beach vacation from NY,” etc.). Another new bot, the StubHub Bot, will help you find tickets to events and concerts, while the IFTTT Bot can funnel information from other apps and services into your Skype chat. This could be useful for a number of things — like getting news alerts, pings about social media mentions, alerts from other services, checking the weather, being notified of important emails or any number of things that you’ve configured IFTTT’s “recipes” to watch out for. One final new bot, Spock, is just for fun. Yes, by adding this bot you can chat with the USS Enterprise’s second-in-command about the ways of Vulcans. (Okay, this one doesn’t enhance your productivity. But hey, work can get boring, right?) Still, though the travel and ticketing bots are more useful than the previously launched more general-purpose Bing bots, they still fall a bit short when it comes to fulfilling the larger vision around bots. Instead of giving you a link to click, the ideal travel bot solution would suggest flights, help you narrow your options, then actually book the travel for you. It should also add the trip to your calendar and email your pre-configured travel contacts (like a boss or significant other). A ticketing bot shouldn’t start by suggesting locations of major metros (NY, LA? Click one!) but ask you where you live. And it shouldn’t just spit back a random array of local events, but rather ask you what sort of event you had in mind, allowing the user to specify whether they want to go to a baseball game or a concert or anything else. We’re not there yet, which is why today’s bots are merely interesting, but not yet must-haves. At the end of the day, the bots aren’t quicker than simply visiting a website and performing searches for yourself — and sometimes, they’re even slower or more frustrating. We should also point out these new bots are not the only ones Skype has added to its directory in recent days. There are a handful of others, including games and horoscopes, an automated virtual assistant called Ava Zoom, a bot that understands the content of images called CaptionBot, a Foursquare bot, a scheduling assistant from FreeBusy and more. Microsoft says that it now has over 30,000 developers building bots on its platform, indicating there is at least some momentum in terms of interest in this new area. The newly announced bots are rolling out to the Skype bot directory now on Android, Windows, iOS, Mac and the web.",4.0
480383,Tumblr Will Ban Porn & Delete Adult Content This Month,"Tumblr has announced an upcoming ban on adult porn content, and their users aren’t happy about it. The changes to the social media and blogging site are an attempt to eradicate porn-related communities on the platform, after Tumblr app was pulled from the Apple iOs app store for child pornography last month. While these changes are a response to crackdowns on child pornography, the reality is, a significant portion of Tumblr members used the platform to engage with adult content (at least 22% of Tumblr users followed and reblogged accounts that posted pornographic content as of 2016). The ban will include photos, GIFs, and videos of ""real-life human genitals or female-presenting nipples, and any content that depicts sex acts,” Tumblr wrote. Tumblr clarified that depictions of so-called 'female-presenting' nipples related with breastfeeding, birth or after-birth, and health related situations, including mastectomy or gender confirmation surgeries, are permitted, along with nudity in art, whether sculpture or illustration. Still, artists who are members of the Tumblr community have voiced concerns with purging and content removal. Tumblr has already started sending notices to members of their community to let them know if their content has been flagged as adult. Starting December 17, if a post is flagged by the algorithm, it will be automatically revert to a private setting so that the content is only viewable by the user. For users who feel their content has been flagged inappropriately, they will be able to appeal decisions through the site or app. While posts will be flagged algorithmically moving forward, entire blogs have the potential to be flagged as ""explicit."" Tumblr said that these blogs will be overlaid with a content filter and users under the age of 18 will not be allowed to click through to see the hidden content. Further, content from these blogs will not appear in search results. Tumblr users were quick to voice their disapproval, with many claiming that this type of adult content was a huge part of their reason for using the site in 2018: “Tumblr is going to be irrelevant starting December 17,” one Twitter user wrote. “It’s the only reason why people still use it so good luck to them,” another user tweeted. Given this how many Tumblr users use the site to access adult content, it remains to be seen how this decision affects Tumblr’s bottom line, and the viability of the platform moving forward.",4.5
487160,Carmakers step up warnings over disorderly Brexit,"PARIS (Reuters) - Carmakers ratcheted up their Brexit warnings on Tuesday, with France’s PSA Group (PEUP.PA) and Germany’s BMW (BMWG.DE) both saying UK production would suffer if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal. With less than six months before Britain is due to quit the EU on March 29, businesses are increasingly alarmed about the lack of agreement over future trading relations and the possibility of tariffs, delays at ports and extra red tape. The car industry, one of the few British manufacturing success stories of recent decades, is particularly at risk given the thousands of parts, engines and finished models that move between Britain and the continent every day. BMW boss Harald Krueger told the Paris Motor Show that he sees a “50:50 chance” of a disorderly, or ‘hard’, Brexit and that this would lead the company to shift more production of its Mini vehicles - currently focused on its Oxford plant in southern England - to the Netherlands. “I told (UK Prime Minister) Theresa May and the European Union that if there is a hard Brexit, both sides are losers. We will no longer fulfil trade agreements and then we are forced to build the car in the Netherlands,” Krueger told journalists. Carlos Tavares, the head of Peugeot and Opel maker PSA Group, which has two factories in Britain, also said a no-deal Brexit would be damaging. “My plan is to tell Mrs May and Mr Barnier (the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator) that a no-deal (Brexit) is not acceptable,” he told reporters. Such an outcome would have “significant consequences”, he added without elaborating. Dieter Zetsche, head of German carmaker Daimler (DAIGn.DE), also told the Paris event that scenarios involving a disorderly Brexit were “highly worrying”. The executives’ comments come as the British prime minister said she was preparing to make a new offer to the EU in an effort to break the Brexit talks deadlock. The various Brexit complications come against the backdrop of a range of challenges facing automakers, including the rollout of costly electric vehicles, tougher emissions rules and potential disruption to trade from the rise of protectionism. Britain’s biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, which warned last month that the wrong kind of Brexit could cost tens of thousands of car jobs, told Reuters it had not made a decision whether to build electric cars in its home market because of uncertainty over future trading relations. Carlos Ghosn, head of the Renault-Nissan alliance that has a large assembly plant in northeast England, also complained about the lack of clarity. “We are in a situation where everybody is frozen,” he said.

491534,Tech workers looking to make a difference in the world should donate their skills – TechCrunch,"Arjuna Costa
Contributor



		Arjuna Costa is a partner at Omidyar Network and early stage investor in Ruma. In 2011, the Chelsea soccer club had one of the best goalkeepers in the world, Petr Čech, but he’d been plagued by injuries. They needed to develop an eventual replacement for the 29-year old Czech, but wanted to keep him as starting goalie for a few more years, so they signed 19-year-old Thibaut Courtois from Belgium, and immediately loaned him out to Atlético Madrid. That may sound strange to American sports fans, but it’s not unusual for English Premier League teams. By loaning out their players, soccer clubs give them opportunities to develop outside the organization. In return, the “borrowing team” gets access to top talent without signing an expensive, lengthy contract. When Courtois returned from Atlético—where he’d started for three seasons—to replace Čech, the two goalkeepers hoisted the 2015 League Cup together. In the Harvard Business Review, researchers point to soccer clubs as a case for loaning out your best talent. You just need an organization like the English Premier League to act as a broker. That’s exactly what nonprofits like Catchafire.org and RippleWorks do for tech talent. Both organizations match volunteers with projects based on their professional skills. Catchafire matches professionals with charities and RippleWorks connects Silicon Valley entrepreneurs with startups in emerging markets. Tech workers get an opportunity to help change the world; charities or social entrepreneurs in Africa, India, Latin America, and Southeast Asia get access to star-expertise to help them scale their business. Loaning Out the Best Minds of a Generation Tech workers may be well-paid, but they’re not necessarily more fulfilled than anyone else. Tiny Pulse, a firm that analyzes employee attitudes, surveyed 5,000 tech workers and found that only 19% were happy at work, compared to 22% of non-tech workers. Like anyone else, tech workers want to put their skills to work in meaningful ways. They want to solve challenging problems alongside other smart, innovative people. Sometimes, that means they need an opportunity to grow outside their company. Facebook data scientist Jeffrey Hammerbacher famously said, “The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads,” when he left Facebook to found Cloudera, a big data platform for enterprises. There’s no shortage of inspiring challenges to work on. Startups in emerging markets are pioneering solutions with the potential for massive social impact, such as free microinsurance tied to mobile phone subscriptions, high-quality schools for $5 a month, and pay-as-you-go solar power. These ideas are emerging from new tech hubs in Bangalore, Lagos, Manila, Medellín, Nairobi, and a dozen other emerging markets. Cheap cloud computing and smartphones have made it easier for socially minded entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into reality. But as we found in a 2014 GSMA report, “launching a new mobile product or service is easier than ever, [but] scaling one is not.” In surveys, dozens of incubators, funders, and emerging market startups told GSMA that, “once startups expand beyond early-adopter customers, local resources are often insufficient to support further scale.” This doesn’t mean funding. Rather, what most entrepreneurs lacked was experience with business issues such as data-driven user acquisition, talent retention, knowing when to upgrade legacy infrastructure, or expanding across borders. An Abundance of (Intangible) Riches A lot has been written about the “secret sauce” that makes Silicon Valley the world’s most successful tech hub. But it is this clustering of very precise knowledge and experience that is fundamental to the sauce. The CEO of Ruma, Aldi Haryopratomo, one of the companies in our FinTech portfolio, told us that just by hanging out in a Silicon Valley coffee shop, founders could find the solution to complicated technical problems. In Silicon Valley, Aldi was employee #7 at Kiva.org, before moving to Indonesia to launch Ruma, and the difference in growing a tech company in both markets was striking. The easy access to expertise in the latest technologies, and the “been-there-done-that” business acumen, are key ingredients to success in Silicon Valley—and the first things missed anywhere else. If Silicon Valley’s secret sauce could be bottled and sold, tech workers wouldn’t be coming here from all over the world. But what if we could turn the migration around—just for a couple of months at a time—and loan out talent who’ve built successful businesses here to share their know-how and work alongside their technologist peers in emerging markets? The World’s Most Exciting Technology Challenges RippleWorks partners with host entrepreneurs to create “bite-sized” projects that busy full-time tech leaders can take on as a volunteering activity, without setting aside their career—and still contributing to a vital stage in the host company’s development. For that, RippleWorks identifies the problem to be solved and selects the right talent among its star-volunteers to solve it in a 3-4 month engagement, which includes a paid 1–2 week trip to the country of the host company. The foundation only selects applicants who’ve demonstrated exceptional success in their field, and ventures with market tractions as well as social purpose. They carefully match volunteers to host companies on projects structured with specific goals and milestones. As part of RippleWorks’ first wave of projects, a volunteer went to Indonesia to help Aldi upgrade his technology platform to meet fast-growing demand, and serve 15 times more customers in the next five years. Loaning themselves out gives volunteers the opportunity to strengthen their skills, broaden their networks, break out of a career rut, and find new meaning in their jobs—benefits that come back to employers in the form of increased engagement and retention. Volunteering tech expertise with organizations like Catchafire.org or RippleWorks is a meaningful experience for Silicon Valley’s most passionate disruptors. It offers a genuine opportunity to put their skills to good use by solving some of the most exciting technology challenges today, while helping entrepreneurs in emerging markets scale solutions that could potentially change the world.",2.5
494498,Beek is the emoji-based book review site aiming to change e-commerce in Latin America – TechCrunch,"Leveraging post-literate tools like YouTube and emojis to create a website and mobile app that allows people to review the books they’re reading while they’re reading them, Beek is a startup that embraces the amazing contradictions of the internet age. Graduating from the most recent batch of Y Combinator, the Mexico City-based company began as a hackathon project in Austin, Texas, where co-founder Pamela Valdes was studying at the University of Texas. Beek co-founders Pamela Valdes and Max Holzeu Beek co-founders Pamela Valdes and Max Holzeu It was at the AngelHack hackathon that Valdes met her partner, Max Holzeu, a Guatemalan immigrant and coder who was working at a web studio in the city. “Austin is like San Francisco in terms of its culture, but it’s much cheaper,” said Holzeu. As the only person at the hackathon who didn’t know how to code, Valdes said she was shunned by most of the developers. But Holzeu was intrigued (and maybe a little piteous) by the brave woman who came with an idea but no technical chops, and agreed to work with her on the project. The initial idea for the company actually pre-dated the hackathon, where Valdes had gone to rustle up some talent to help her build a minimum viable product. The idea came from a class that Valdes had talked her way into with the famous venture investor Robert Metcalfe, a professor on the faculty at the UT Austin. “I didn’t have a product before I had the class with Bob,” Valdes recalls. “I had the idea with 10,000 followers on Facebook when it started. I did a lot of sketches and mock-ups on the design.” By the end of the class, when she had met Holzeu, Valdes knew she had a business and convinced Max to return to Mexico City with her to get the idea off the ground. The key to Beek’s simple success is its ease of use. A user can download the app and sign in through an integration with Facebook or Twitter, or by generating an email and password. Once in the app, a user can either browse through book titles or genres that are automatically populated or import a reading list from GoodReads. This user had a hard time getting the integration with GoodReads to work and wound up giving up on the process after waiting about a minute for the integration to occur. Under the genre heading (with categories like “Teen,” “LGBT,” “Dystopias,” and “Fantasy”) users get pre-populated book suggestions as well as clips from famous BookTubers (YouTube reviewers who film book reviews). In Mexico, where BookTubing (creating book reviews on YouTube) is a thing with its own conference, Beek has been racking up the hits. Ideally, future integrations would include getting access to book lists in an Amazon, iBooks or Google’s Play Books accounts. Already the company has about 250,000 monthly active users, who have reviewed roughly 200,000 titles and, according to the founders, the company is only just getting started. Beek has loftier goals than simply being a book review site. Like Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, Valdes and her partner see books as a gateway to an expanding number of markets. Ultimately, the company wants to be the user-generated source for online reviews across Latin America. “Amazon is not really popular in Latin America,” says Valdes. “There’s a huge opportunity in becoming the trusted review site for people and then using that platform to sell products.” A vision like that could turn this simple book review site into a next-generation e-commerce juggernaut.",4.0

ARC said last month it would sell shares worth 4 billion rand ($309 million) in an IPO that values the company at 8.5 billion rand, with about 25 percent sold to three cornerstone investors, including Singapore’s GIC Pte Ltd . The company, which said it will list on the Johannesburg Securities Exchange on September 7, said the offer was oversubscribed and that it will offer a further 35 million shares at 8.50 rand each. “The gross proceeds from the offer will increase from 1.9 billion rand to 2.2 billion rand,” ARC said in a statement, adding that together with the funds from cornerstone investors it would have raised 4.3 billion rand in total. ARC was formed about a year ago by Motsepe and two other veteran financial services executives, Johan van Zyl and Johan van der Merwe, to build a company controlled by black people and spanning everything from life insurance, healthcare, money management and banking. More than two decades after the end of apartheid, many black South Africans still feel excluded from the economy, despite laws and industry efforts to broaden ownership of the JSE.

Take, for example, the San Andreas Streaming Deer Cam, a live video stream of an artificially intelligent deer wandering the 100 square miles of San Andreas, the game's parody of Los Angeles and Northern California.  Created by artist Brent Watanabe, the modification to Grand Theft Auto 5 emphasizes the craftsmanship that went into the designing the original game. Oh deer ""In the past 48 hours,"" reads the official site's video description, ""the deer has wandered along a moonlit beach, caused a traffic jam on a major freeway, been caught in a gangland gun battle, and been chased by the police."" We've seen other game designers tweak and modify San Andreas to feature cartoon characters, non-Newtonian physics, and biblical floods. Real world photographers have used the virtual world as a place to ply their trade. What's fascinating about the Deer Cam is that it's meant to be watched, rather than played. A stream of a computer-controlled deer removes the game's two defining features (freedom and violence) and emphasizes what player can't control (the art and the AI). A video game publisher spent millions of dollars and recruited industry-leading artists and designers to produce the most authentic city in the history of video games, then used the city for a story of crime and midlife anxiety. Now artists without budgets are mining that city for the other, sometimes more interesting stories it has to tell. The deer cam is, sadly, frozen at the time of publish. It is expected to return today at 6:00PM ET. In the meantime, you can watch a recap of footage recorded in late February. ",2.5
518153,Brussels attacker may have supported Islamic State -prosecutors,"BRUSSELS, June 21 (Reuters) - The man suspected of an abortive bomb attack on Brussels Central Station on Tuesday may have supported the Islamic State militant group, Belgium’s federal prosecutors said in a statement after a search on his home. Investigators found chemical substances and materials that could be used to make explosives and concluded that he probably made the bomb there. “There are also indications that the suspect had sympathies for the terrorist organization IS,” the prosecutors said on Wednesday.

519905,"Mars is emerging from an ice age that ended about 400,000 years ago","Mars is emerging from an ice age, according to a new study. Studying the Martian climate and how it changes over time can help scientists better plan future missions to Mars and even understand climate change here on Earth, the study authors say. Models had already predicted that Mars underwent several rounds of ice ages in the past, but little physical measurements ever confirmed those predictions. Today’s study, published in the journal Science, is the first to map the ice deposits on the north and south pole and confirm that Mars is emerging from an ice age, in a retreat that began almost 400,000 years ago. The researchers also calculated just how much ice accumulated over the poles; the amount is so big that if it were spread throughout Mars, the entire planet would be covered by a 2-foot thick layer of ice. Studying climate change on Mars is important for multiple reasons Studying climate change on Mars is important for multiple reasons, says study co-author Isaac Smith, who studies sedimentary systems on Mars at Southwest Research Institute. By understanding ice ages, we can get a better understanding of how ice — and water — behaved through time on the Red Planet. It can help us figure out how Mars went from being a wet world to the barren, frigid land it is today. And it can tell us where ice deposits can be found. That’s key if we plan to send humans on Mars. ""We want to know the history of water,"" Smith says. ""At some point, we’re going to have some people there and we’d like to know where the water is. So there’s a big search for that."" The Martian climate can also inform scientists about climate change here on Earth, Smith says. Mars is the most similar planet to Earth in the Solar System and it provides a good testing ground for climate research, because there are no people burning fossil fuels and pumping global warming pollutants into the atmosphere. ""Mars is a very good laboratory for what happens on Earth,"" Smith says. ""Climate science actually has a very simple but perfect laboratory in Mars, where we can learn about the physics of climate change and then apply what we learn to Earth."" Ali Bramson, a planetary scientist and PhD candidate at the University of Arizona, who did not work on the study, agrees. ""I think it’s a really great study and I think it’s very timely,"" she says. ""I was really excited to see it. … Climate change is obviously a very salient topic on Earth, but understanding the distribution of water-ice on Mars is also something that’s of great interest because there’s a lot of interest in sending humans one day to Mars. So if we know where there are reservoirs of water-ice, that could potentially be useful for future human exploration."" Mars ""is not a dead, static world. Things are going on and changing."" Just like Earth, Mars undergoes cycles of climate change and ice ages. But unlike Earth, climate change on Mars is affected primarily by how ""tilted"" the planet is. Every planet has an axis around which the planet rotates. Earth’s axis is tilted 23.5 degrees and it’s pretty stable, varying only a couple of degrees over time. Mars’ axis is currently tilted 25 degrees, but it wobbles between from 10 to 40 degrees. That happens for two reasons: first, Mars doesn’t have a moon as big as ours to stabilize its orbit; second, it’s much closer to Jupiter, and Jupiter's gravity affects Mars’ rotation. When the Red Planet’s axis is more tilted, the poles receive more sunlight and get warm — so the ice redistributes to the mid-latitudes, just above the tropic. That’s when Mars undergoes an ice age. ""The impact is pretty dramatic,"" says Peter Read, a physics professor at the University of Oxford. Today’s study was based on predictions that 400,000 years ago such a shift in the planet’s axis took place. The researchers used radar instruments onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, a NASA spacecraft that’s orbiting Mars. They analyzed the radar images of the ice deposits within the planet’s polar ice caps, looking out for signs of erosion and other features, like so-called spiral troughs that are created by the wind. Tracing these features can reveal how ice accumulated and retreated through time. The researchers confirmed that around 400,000 years ago an ice age ended. Since the end of that ice age, about 87,000 cubic kilometers of ice accumulated at the poles, especially in the north pole. That’s exciting, because 400,000 years is pretty recent when talking about planets in the Solar System. The study is ""another bit of evidence that climate is still actively changing on Mars,"" says Stephen Lewis, a senior lecturer at the Open University, who didn’t work on the study. Mars ""is not a dead, static world. Things are going on and changing."" Correction: A previous version of this story stated that an ice age began on Mars about 400,000 years ago. In fact, it ended 400,000 years ago. The story has been changed throughout to reflect this fact. We regret the error.",4.0

529122,Rising costs tarnish HSBC's Asia-driven profit growth,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - HSBC reported rising costs on Monday, sending its shares one percent lower and taking the shine off a better-than-expected quarterly profit driven by the Asian business that the bank has put at the heart of its growth plans. Third quarter expenses for Europe’s biggest bank by market capitalization rose 7 percent, higher than analysts expected, as HSBC invested more in its retail banking and wealth management unit and paid out more in bonuses to staff. The results highlighted the difficult path HSBC is walking between cost cutting and growth, as it seeks to increase income again following a period of wider restructuring after the 2008 global financial crisis. HSBC earlier this month chose veteran John Flint as its next chief executive, with its newly arrived chairman promoting an insider to drive revenue growth. Flint will take over as CEO in February 2018. With Flint, who spent much of his early career in Asia, and regional veteran Chairman Mark Tucker at the helm, analysts expect the London-based bank’s shift toward its second home market of Asia to accelerate. “We’ve got good momentum, we’re seeing good investor appetite for new business coming through not only in Hong Kong but further afield in Asia,” Group Finance Director Iain Mackay told Reuters. Pretax profit was $4.6 billion in the September quarter, up from $843 million in the same period a year ago, HSBC said in a stock exchange filing. The profit was roughly in-line with analyst estimates of $4.7 billion. The year-ago profit was significantly impacted by a one-off loss of $1.7 billion from the sale of its Brazilian unit, and adverse foreign currency movements. Reported pretax profit for the Asia operations, which account for 70 percent of the bank’s overall profits, rose 10 percent during the third quarter to $4 billion. “Our international network continued to deliver strong growth ... and our pivot to Asia is driving higher returns and lending growth, particularly in Hong Kong,” HSBC Group Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver said in the statement. HSBC saw return on equity, a key measure of profitability, almost double to 8.2 percent in the first nine months of the year but it did not give a timeframe for achieving its long-term goal of 10 percent. “We won’t achieve 10 percent by the end of 2017, but we are heading in the right direction,” Mackay said. HSBC shares were down one percent in London at 1000 GMT, as investors reacted more to the lender’s surprise increase in costs than its better-than-expected profits. HSBC has been able to boost its capital buffer despite rolling out share buybacks, the latest of up to $2 billion in July, and sustaining dividends, showing it is ahead on its turnaround strategy that includes expanding in Asia. The bank makes more than half of its profits in Asia, and its regional pivot is centered around China’s Pearl River Delta region with billions in investment commitments and plans to bolster its retail and wealth management business. Its customer base for retail banking and wealth management in mainland China had expanded by more than 70 percent so far this year, it said. HSBC’s common equity tier 1 ratio - a measure of financial strength - was 14.6 percent at the end of September, slightly lower than 14.7 percent at end-June this year, but in-line with analyst expectations. The ratio is set to increase in the medium term, as the bank repatriates about $8 billion stuck at its U.S. subsidiary, following approval last year from the U.S. Federal Reserve. HSBC posted a 5 percent drop in adjusted revenue in fixed income, currencies and commodities business during the quarter. Some of its European rivals such as Barclays (BARC.L) saw the same business fall by more than 20 percent in the period. The bank could end up moving fewer than 1000 jobs to Paris following Britain’s exit from the European Union, Mackay told reporters on a conference call, following previous remarks from senior bank executives suggesting that many roles would move.

530034,"New trailers: Rogue One, Valerian, Slenderman, and more","I rewatched The Big Short recently, and one moment near the end of the film stood out to me in a way that didn't quite register my first time through. Steve Carell's character — a surly, idealistic investor — has been holding bankers' feet to the fire, watching them sweat by refusing to sell off valuable assets while the entire industry collapses around them at the beginning of the 2008 financial crisis. Bankers are disgusting and corrupt, he’s seen, and he wants to teach them all a lesson. But then the bailout comes, and Carell’s character realizes that none of the bankers will ever be held responsible and that the assets he has are about to become worthless. He looks down only to see that he's never been holding anyone to the fire. There's nothing there. Nothing. His fundamental assumptions about how the system worked were wrong. It’s a hell of a thing to find out. Check out 10 trailers from this week below. Imagine a mashup of Avatar and Jupiter Ascending, with the strange aliens of The Phantom Menace and the oddball everything of The Fifth Element. That’s the best I can do to describe what it feels like watching the trailer for Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, the first big sci-fi film from Luc Besson since The Fifth Element. So long as you don’t count Lucy. It comes out next July. I don’t usually post international trailers, but this is Star Wars after all, and any time there’s new footage, people are gonna want to analyze it. And honestly, this trailer is surprisingly good by virtue of it just being itself and not trying to do too much. Oh, and also there’s Vader. It’ll be out December 16th in the US. The story told by this documentary is far more horrifying than any Slenderman tale out there on the internet. Beware the Slenderman follows the case of two 12-year-old girls who repeatedly stabbed a classmate (who thankfully survived) while trying to prove that Slenderman exists. The girls’ case is now moving through the courts. This documentary comes to HBO on January 23rd. This trailer is honestly way too on the nose for this week and I kind of can’t handle it. The show starts November 30th. I love this. The Brand New Testament is a strange, Jean-Pierre Jeunet-esque comedy in which God’s rebellious daughter decides to text everyone on Earth how long they have left to live. Just watch it. The film comes out December 9th. Hunter Gatherer is about a man trying to rebuild his life from square one and all the interesting, comforting, and eccentric people he meets along the way. The film got good reviews at SXSW, and now it’s headed to theaters with a limited release starting November 16th. Filmmaker Raoul Peck brings to life an unfinished work by James Baldwin in I Am Not Your Negro, a documentary examining the lives and history of black men and women in America. The film has received almost nothing but fantastic reviews, and this short trailer makes it look remarkably beautiful. It comes out February 3rd. I haven’t seen The Expanse, but Verge editor Andrew Liptak has been saying the show is a must-see. Its new season starts February 8th on Syfy, so you’ve got a few months if you want to catch up. Speaking of Syfy series that come recommended from Andrew… Syfy put out a trailer this week for The Magicians’ second season, and the production of it all looks surprisingly magical. Like The Expanse, there’s some time to catch up if you’re behind. The Magicians’ second season starts January 25th. Snappy dialog. Vibrant colors. Dance sequences. I am so sold on this. La La Land opens December 9th.",3.0
531668,Valve adds full PS4 controller support to Steam,"Valve has extended its support for the PlayStation 4’s DualShock controller in Steam. Users can now customize the controller as deeply as they can Valve’s own Steam Controllers, allowing them to map custom functions to the DualShock’s touchpad and gyroscope, as well as reconfigure the traditional buttons and joysticks. All this will be handled through Steam’s native API. This will be welcome news for gamers, especially those who are already using the PS4 controller on their PC, but are currently relying on third-party software to get the two talking. Support for the DualShock 4 on Steam has been in beta for a while, but with the software’s latest patch it’s now available to everyone. Valve’s Jeff Bellinghausen announced support for the controller at Steam Dev Days earlier this year. “Now, why start with the PS4 controller?” he said. “Well, not only is it a really nice, high quality controller, but it’s also got a gyro and a touchpad, so it’s got a lot of overlapping functionality with the Steam Controller.” He added that “similar support” for other controllers would be coming some time in the future.",5.0
532982,Preventable death rates in rural America are higher than in cities,"Death rates in the US hit a historic low in 2014, but they’re dropping much more slowly outside of the big metropolitan areas, new science says. This disparity reveals a massive health gap between rural and urban populations. The 46 million people who live in rural areas need better access to affordable medical care, and public health programs that promote healthy habits, CDC scientists say. A higher percentage of people under age 80 who live in rural regions die of heart disease, cancer, lung disease, stroke, and accidental injuries, according to results published today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What’s more, the researchers estimated that more of the deaths from accidental injuries and lung disease were preventable in rural regions than in metropolitan areas. In the study, epidemiologists compared death rates and causes of death for each group between 1999 and 2014, and calculated how many deaths were what the CDC considers preventable. The authors of a commentary published alongside the research paper attributed the higher rural death rates to demographics: people who live in rural areas “tend to be older, poorer, and sicker than their urban counterparts,” they wrote. More people smoke, fewer people eat healthy diets, and fewer people are able to exercise in their spare time — in large part because many suffer from chronic health conditions, according to the report. Illness and poverty make it even more difficult, if not impossible, to take the time to cook healthy food or go for a run, which can make sick people sicker. All of these risk factors contribute to higher rates of high blood pressure and obesity, which themselves are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, cancer, and stroke. Because there are more underinsured and uninsured people living in rural regions than in cities, people also have less access to preventative care like cancer screenings — which means that a dangerous health problem could easily be missed until it’s too late. Deaths from accidental injuries are almost 50 percent more common in rural areas. That includes more opioid overdoses, possibly because of unsafe prescribing practices as well as  restrictions on who can administer an antidote to overdoses called naloxone. Car crashes are also more lethal, at least in part because fewer people wear seat belts, according to the report. Trauma centers with the resources and expertise to treat devastating injuries are much farther away — which means injured people are more likely to die without the care they need. Curbing the higher death rate in rural areas will take increasing access to care, as well as education, according to the CDC’s commentary. But as the government discusses repealing the Affordable Care Act, which gave 20 million uninsured people health insurance, it could be even harder for people to get the care they need in the future.",4.0
533056,I can’t wait until this Chainsmokers song about nothing is the biggest song in America,"Kaitlyn Tiffany: The Chainsmokers. What do you know about them? Lizzie Plaugic: They love art. Kaitlyn: But did you know they’re behind the hit song “Closer,” which was inescapable in America this past year? Or that they’re an electronic pop-duo made up of two men named Drew Taggart and Alex Pall? Or that they’ve claimed their penises are 17.34 inches when put together? Lizzie: They love math. Kaitlyn: Did you know that they have a new song? It’s called “Paris,” but it’s not about Paris the city. No, this “paris:” Lizzie: Ah yes, that paris, the lowercase one, the one that Drew Taggart and Alex Pall, poets both, just made up. Kaitlyn: Listen, I want to start by saying that I love the song “Closer.” I love the memes it inspired, I love that we all had to spend six months asking “Why would anyone steal their roommate’s mattress?” and “How do you bite a tattoo off a shoulder?” I love the teen who filmed herself dancing to “Closer” while wearing a teddy bear costume that was actually just an enormous teddy bear with the stuffing ripped out. I loved the Chainsmokers’ terrible performance of “Closer” at the Video Music Awards because who among us has not tried and failed? I love “Closer.” I just want to get that out of the way before we talk any more about “Paris,” Paris, or “paris.” Lizzie:  “Closer” is a song. But it’s not this song. According to the Chainsmokers, “paris” is a “condition for fantasy.” According to me, a “condition for fantasy” is this song, because it makes me fantasize about being somewhere else. So the definition checks out. Kaitlyn:  Oh, Lizzie, how nice for you to be able to maintain your fantasy life while at work! Most of the footage in the music video for “Paris” looks like it was shot in Orlando or the Adirondacks. Is that where you hope to go? To me, the most notable thing about “Paris” is that it purports to be about a human emotion that doesn’t actually exist. The Chainsmokers literally invented the emotion “paris,” for the purpose of this soon-to-be-very-popular song. I find that alarming! If you were going to write a song about a nostalgic experience, and you also never had an experience to feel nostalgic about, this is the sort of song you would write. An alien, upon watching Casablanca, would describe the human experiences of romance and longing as “paris” (a word it just learned), “cigarette,” “terrace,” and [danger], all things melded into the loose blob that is the song “Paris.” Hopefully all of you right now #paris pic.twitter.com/cPkrYjILP0 Lizzie: Speaking of loose blobs, “Paris” (the song) is one, structurally speaking. It barely has a melody. Taggart sings like he keeps his mouth super dry to trick us into thinking his vocals could be described as “gravelly.” “Paris” has no drops and a limp chorus. It’s all bridge: a bridge to nowhere, and then when you get to nowhere, Drew Taggart and the other one are waiting there standing on a terrace talking about a new definition for a word they just made up. Kaitlyn: Two metaphors… one for each Chainsmoker. Beautiful. Lizzie, I have to tell you, as much as this is the worst song I’ve ever heard… it’s also stuck in my head. I feel obliged to ask: have we or have we not each listened to it more than one time today at least? (And for me, more than four times?) And is that or is that not the point of a pop song? Lizzie:  I personally already know every word. Kaitlyn: I have another question, and it’s this lyric from “Paris:” I thought, “Wow / If I could take this in a shot right now / I don't think that we could work this out.” What? Lizzie: Look, if you get drunk, it’s a bad idea to work out right after. Watch one episode of Darren’s Dance Grooves and you will discover this immediately. Kaitlyn: Okay. I will.",3.5
533530,1984 tops Amazon’s charts as Trump continues to lie,"Online sales of George Orwell’s novel 1984 have soared in recent days, as President Donald Trump continues to spread lies and misinformation. The dystopian book, first published in 1949, is now the best-selling book on Amazon as of Wednesday morning, and sits at number six among paid books in Apple’s iBooks app. 1984 began climbing Amazon’s rankings after Press Secretary Sean Spicer blatantly lied to the media last week about the crowd size at Trump’s inauguration. White House senior advisor Kellyanne Conway later defended Spicer’s comments on Sunday, describing them as “alternative facts” on NBC’s Meet the Press. Conway’s comments drew comparisons to Orwell’s term “doublethink” — the ability to believe two contradictory things simultaneously — and “Newspeak,” the deliberately misleading language of the totalitarian state described in the book. A spokesman for Penguin, the publisher of 1984, told CNN that sales for the book typically rise at the beginning of the year, since it is commonly part of curricula in schools. But the spokesman said the spike seen this week has been unusually high. ""We put through a 75,000 copy reprint this week,” the spokesman said to CNN. “That is a substantial reprint and larger than our typical reprint for 1984."" The last time 1984 saw a surge in sales was in 2013, after Edward Snowden leaked details about the National Security Agency’s mass surveillance programs.",3.5
537493,Bose’s new Revolve Bluetooth speakers look great and play sound in every direction,"Bose has launched a pair of new Bluetooth speakers, the SoundLink Revolve ($199) and Revolve+ ($299). They both feature aluminum, cylindrical designs and — like the popular UE Boom line — play 360-degree, omnidirectional audio. Bose is really promising a great listening experience from these; the company says the Revolve+ in particular is the best-sounding Bluetooth speaker it has ever produced. The SoundLink Mini II already offered some of the best sound quality from a portable Bluetooth speaker, so if this tops that, it should be a strong performer. Each comes in black or silver. I think they look mostly good, but also like a weird hybrid of Google Home and a metal water bottle. The main differences between the two speakers are size and battery life. The Revolve measures around 6 inches tall; the Revolve+ is 7.2 inches with a larger diameter and includes a non-removable fabric handle for easy carrying. Bose says those bigger dimensions let the Revolve+ generate “higher-volume, more room-filling sound than SoundLink Revolve.” The regular Revolve can run for up to 12 hours, whereas the plus version extends that to 16. Two speakers can be joined wirelessly for a wider stereo soundstage. Both are water resistant (IPX4), so they should keep playing just fine in the rain. There’s a microphone built in, which you can use for speakerphone calls or after hitting the dedicated “multi-function button” that will either trigger Siri or Google Assistant depending on what kind of phone you’ve got. Speaking of which, you can connect to two devices simultaneously, and the Revolve remembers the last eight devices it’s been paired with. There’s also NFC to further speed up pairing for Android users. There’s no Alexa here, obviously, but Bose’s FAQ is quick to remind people that you can easily combine the Revolve with an Echo Dot. Bose includes a 3.5mm auxiliary jack if you prefer to use either speaker wired, and the speaker charges either via MicroUSB (not USB Type-C, unfortunately) or a sold-separately charging dock. Maybe the most “huh!” thing about these speakers is that they’ve got a tripod thread on the bottom. Bose is already shipping the Revolve and Revolve+ right now, so we’re hoping to get our hands on them very soon. It does feel like a lot of money for a Bluetooth speaker, especially when Ultimate Ears is still targeting new products at that under-$100 price point.",4.0
546982,Women might be less likely to get CPR because people are afraid of touching their chests,"Women who are having a heart attack are less likely to get bystander CPR and more likely to die, according to a new study — and it may be because people are reluctant to touch women’s chests. A new study looked at 20,000 cases of cardiac arrest and found that 39 percent of women who had heart attacks in a public place received CPR, compared to 45 percent of men. Possibly as a result, men were 23 percent more likely to survive. The results were discussed at the American Heart Association conference in Anaheim, California, and were reported by The Associated Press. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Heart Association. Cardiac arrest happens when the heart stops pumping. Administering CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation — an emergency procedure that involves pressing on the chest repeatedly to restore blood to the brain and heart — can help survival odds until doctors can administer medication to try to restart the heart. More than 350,000 Americans suffer cardiac arrest in a place that’s not a hospital. The researchers don’t know exactly why rescuers were less likely to help women. But because there was no difference in CPR rates for women who had cardiac arrest at home, where the victim knows the rescuer, they think maybe the cause is fear of touching unknown women. “It can be kind of daunting thinking about pushing hard and fast on the center of a woman’s chest,” said Audrey Blewer, a University of Pennsylvania researcher who led the study, according to the AP. CPR training may be biased in subtle ways, Blewer continued. For example, even practice mannequins are usually male torsos. It’s possible rescuers worry about touching women’s breasts or moving a women’s clothing, according to another study author, Benjamin Abella at the University of Pennsylvania. “This is not a time to be squeamish, because it’s a life-and-death situation,” Abella said, according to AP. 2:09 p.m. 11/13/2017 Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that defibrillators work when the heart stops pumping. Defibrillators  treat irregular heart rhythms, but do not work when the heart has stopped entirely.  ",5.0
547975,Airbnb wants to offer virtual reality previews of rental spots,"Airbnb is developing virtual and augmented reality features to help guests find and navigate rental listings, the company announced on its blog today. Three-dimensional scans and 360-degree photos would allow users to get a better sense of a listing, and augmented reality overlays could help guests better understand the homes on a smaller scale once they’re in it. The company has been looking into VR to build trust between guests and hosts since last year, and this announcement confirming experiments and prototypes could mean a feature is coming soon. It makes sense to take a look around a listing in VR before booking, but Airbnb also lists a few instances where augmented reality might be helpful during your trip. If you’re staying overseas and everything’s in a foreign language, it could be difficult to unlock the door, or figure out the thermostat or the hot water in the shower. It also lists a fun example of AR usefulness like “pulling up a mobile device to get directions to the coffee mugs ... first thing in the morning.” This is a problem that could easily be solved by just opening up a few cupboards and figuring it out, but I get what they’re saying. Virtual tours have been around in the real estate industry for a while, and Airbnb hosts have been asking for a feature to integrate them into their own listings. While the VR technologies could be implemented by providing Airbnb hosts with 360-degree cameras, it might be harder to integrate the AR concept for individual listings. Since ARKit was released on iOS 11, we’ve seen some concepts of what an AR overlay for Airbnb listings might look like. It seems like a useful and worthwhile idea, but it might be a more difficult challenge for Airbnb to take on. But until this is a reality, I’ll still be satisfied with charming hand-written binders with tips on the local sights and illustrations on how to figure out the thermostat.",4.5
549704,"Patients turned away, SpaceX delays: here’s how the government shutdown hits science","As Congress scrambles to reach a budget deal, the federal government is still shut down. That means hundreds of thousands of federal employees will not be returning to work this week — including employees for the national agencies that deal with science, like the National Institutes of Health or the Environmental Protection Agency. Since we don’t know how long the shutdown will last, it’s impossible to say how far-ranging its effects will be. But we can look to the agencies’ contingency plans and the aftermath of the 2013 federal shutdown, which lasted 16 days, for clues. Here is what the government shutdown will mean for these science agencies: Patients currently enrolled in NIH studies — for instance, patients in hospitals right now — will still be taken care of, but the institute will not bring on any new patients. During the 2013 shutdown, the agency had to turn away 200 patients each week, including 30 children. Patients applying for NIH studies are often extremely sick, because they’re willing to take a risk on an experimental treatment. Headed into lab now to prepare for government shutdown. I'll have to reroute fly food delivery to my house. We'll be allowed in on Monday for 4 hours and then all labs must close until further notice. In 2013, labs were closed for 17 days. The NIH will also stop processing grants and put employees on leave. In 2013, 80 percent of its employees were put on leave, and the institute rescheduled the review of nearly 14,000 grant applications. Dr. Antony Fauci, who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told The Associated Press last week that scientists were in a “scramble” and concerned about their experiments. “From a practical standpoint, when you’re dealing with science you have experiments that have been going on for months, if not years, and all of a sudden you have to stop,” he said. Some scientists have reported needing to reroute fly food delivery to their homes. Additionally, PubMed, an academic database primarily of life science papers, is no longer up to date. The CDC will place about 60 percent of its staff on leave, according to The Washington Post. Thankfully, flu tracking will continue, as it has been deemed “essential” by the Department of Health and Human Services. (This year’s flu season has been particularly bad, and the flu-tracking system was shut down in 2013.) The staff will continue supporting the hurricane response efforts, according to a HHS contingency plan. But most of its disease prevention and treatment programs would lapse, and it will take longer to track outbreaks. EPA administrator Scott Pruitt has said that the agency will operate normally this week even if the government shuts down. “At this time EPA has sufficient resources to remain open for a limited amount of time in the event of a government shutdown,” he wrote in an email. It is unclear how long the agency can continue operating if the shutdown continues, but an administration official told The Washington Post that it’s possible the agency could tap into cash reserves. The EPA does have a contingency plan, but EPA spokesperson Jahan Wilcox told The Hill that the plan is outdated and doesn’t necessarily reflect its plans. About 54 percent of NOAA’s 11,400 employees are being asked to stay home during the government shutdown, interrupting the operation of research vessels, for instance. Most of the “excepted” employees are those working for the National Weather Service, which makes weather forecasts needed for air travel, military operations, and to protect the public. But the reduced staffing puts a strain on the workforce that’s still required to go to work without pay. And if equipment like weather instruments or the computers that spit out forecasts break, it could take longer to repair them. “There’s all kinds of additional stress on the forecasters at this time,” Bill Hooke, director of American Meteorological Society Policy Program, tells The Verge. Essential personnel that operate satellites and keep astronauts safe on the International Space Station keep working during a government shutdown. But longer-term projects, like preparations on the James Webb Space Telescope, may come to halt, according to Nature. Commercial spaceflight companies are also being affected by the shutdown: SpaceX, for instance, won’t be able to test fire its new Falcon Heavy rocket, because it needs support from the US Air Force, which oversees launches from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. That creates further delays for SpaceX, which was planning to launch the Falcon Heavy for the first time at the end of January. At the FDA, 45 percent of employees will go on leave. The agency will end most of its safety activities, covering areas such as food safety, cosmetics safety inspections, and compliance. After the closure of national parks and monuments caused public outrage during the 2013 shutdown, the Trump administration decided to keep national parks largely open this time. The parks, however, will have limited staffing, and that means visitor centers, campgrounds, and full-service bathrooms will be closed, according to The Washington Post. The decision to keep parks open has been criticized: because many park rangers won’t be on the job, visitors will have to visit the parks at their own risk. “The capacity for rescue if a visitor gets into an accident is going to be limited,” Bill Wade, who worked for the NPS for more than 30 years, told The New Republic. “There might be some EMTs and law enforcement around, but if there’s a problem that needs more people, those people aren’t going to be available.” Nearly 90 percent of all personnel in the department are considered “essential” and will continue to work during the shutdown, a spokesperson for the DHS wrote in an email to The Verge. At FEMA specifically, the one-call response employees, whose salaries are funded from the Disaster Relief Fund and not the government budget, will work their regular schedules, according to a FEMA official. The US Army Corps of Engineers will continue emergency response work to protect life and property, and will still operate its hydropower plants and other flood control projects. The Department of Energy is least affected by the shutdown, in part because 16 of its 17 laboratories are run by independent contractors and not government employees. All employees are returning to work this week as usual, and labs will stay open until the Department of Energy spends its cash reserve. “Bottom line: the Department of Energy will be open for business on Monday,” spokesperson Shaylyn Hynes told Nature. There is no information on how long these reserves might last, however. The problem with government shutdowns is not just the temporary closure of government labs and the huge waste of money. (In 2013, the shutdown cost the US economy $24 billion.) In the long run, it could hurt the government’s ability to attract smart and ambitious researchers. “My guess is that over time, the best and brightest simply will not consider government service as highly as they would have,” Dave Titley, director of the Center for Solutions to Weather and Climate Risk at Penn State, tells The Verge. Titley was talking about NWS employees specifically, but the same risk applies across all government agencies. “This is a sort of longer term-impact.”  ",2.5
550594,Supreme’s Stern pinball machine targets rare demographic of hypebeast pinball nerds,"Stern, the leading authority on pinball machines, has partnered with Supreme, the brand responsible for the group of people you least want to encounter at a Yeezy pop-up shop, to bring you a gadget that marries both interests. Supreme announced the collaboration through a promo video on its Instagram last night, which shows a sleek, glossy playfield, and the illuminated Supreme box logo everywhere. It also features an LED point screen flashing things like “Multiball is lit,” which I incorrectly presumed was use of popular youth slang, but is actually just a normal pinball term for when multiple balls are in play at once. Spring/Summer 2018 Supreme®/Stern® Pinball Machine   @kings0l0m0n A post shared by  Supreme (@supremenewyork) on Feb 11, 2018 at 8:01am PST Supreme fans should be thrilled about the addition of a new item to add to their collection of branded kayaks and axes, while longtime pinball enthusiasts are scratching their heads in their forums: A price hasn’t yet been announced, but given that Stern pinball machines retail for around $6,000 to $8,000, we can probably expect that this one will cost way more. You think Supreme would be upstaged by a Ghostbusters pinball machine? I don’t think so. Since most people don’t own pinball machines in their homes, it’s certainly worth playing at least once for 25 cents a pop if you see it in any retail shops. It’s a fully functioning, playable game, and it’s definitely not as useless as a Supreme-branded brick.",3.0
555940,Six utilities to make your Mac more powerful,"Processor with Dieter Bohn is a YouTube show that takes a deeper look at how consumer technology is changing and how we should think about our gadgets as people, not just as users. Subscribe here. I’ve written a few times now about the lengths I’ve gone to tweak how I interact with my computers. I’ve set up and configured Alfred with a bunch of little custom-built utilities for searching the web. I’ve spent way too many hours trying out different menu bar utilities that provide helpful functions that aren’t built in the OS. I’ve ranted on The Vergecast about how the iPad doesn’t quite work as my main computer because I always seem to want just one more app on my screen. This week’s episode of Processor is another one of these “pro tip” kinds of videos, where I just lay out six of the menu bar utilities I’m using on my Mac. Increasingly, though, I am uncomfortable with the distinction we casually make between “pro” users and “regular” users. I don’t think these sorts of utilities are useful just for computer nerds. (There’s another category we should leave behind us.) I think they’re useful for everybody. Put another way: we’re all “pro” users. I want to be clear that I believe computers should be made in a way that makes them simple and accessible enough for everybody. The trick is creating a learning curve that allows people to get better at using them. At some point, everybody hits a moment when they think, “Ugh, why does my computer make doing this one thing so annoying?” Giving people the ability to solve that kind of problem is important. It’s empowering, just as much as the current push to teach people to learn to code. I tend to prefer using computer platforms that make it relatively easy to fix that one thing through little add-ons (Mac and Windows) that others do not (iOS and Chrome OS). That’s changing soon, I hope. iOS will soon have Siri Shortcuts, which could empower iOS users to really personalize how their iPhones and iPads work. Chrome OS is improving through a mix of Android apps and extensions. I don’t have a fully formed manifesto here, just a sort of rumbling feeling that the dominance of the smartphone made us (and the companies that make them) take the desktop for granted. The metaphor of the desktop is really powerful. I’m not only talking about the original Xerox PARC set of metaphors of windows and a mouse pointer. I’m talking about setting up your own workspace — a thing that is maybe cluttered and messy, but you know exactly where your stuff is because you put it there. Once upon a time, adherents to a movement called Taylorism believed that we could optimize the time of every human worker. We could precisely measure everything they did in the workplace, optimizing the placement of parts on an assembly line or the position of papers on a desk. That kind of attitude stifles creativity. It stifles humanity. We’re more creative and less dehumanized when we can control our own spaces and think at our own paces. There’s something Taylor-esque about computers that you can’t customize. You wouldn’t want to work in an office where some Kafka-esque managerial system dictated the precise layout of your desk, yet your computer is equally as stringent. The difference, of course, is that it’s much harder to customize your desktop to your liking than it is to move stuff around on a physical desk. We have to learn how to use these digital tools. More importantly, we need to ensure that computer continues to allow them to exist. We’ve learned a lot from mobile platforms about how to make computers intuitive and easy to use, and we’re going to gain a lot as mobile apps come to the desktop over the next few years. As that happens, we need to make sure that we don’t lose what made that desktop metaphor so powerful in the first place. It is a digital space we can make our own. As an aside, I have no patience for people who think that learning how to customize computers is too hard or is just a thing for pros and nerds. Humans are very good at learning new abstractions if you give them the means to do it. I mean: just watch a teenager use Snapchat, an interface that almost actively works to prevent you from understanding it. Anyway, this is all probably a little too heady, and I’m over my conceptual skis. So I’ll just dial it back and tell you about the six utilities I talk about in the video above, all for the Mac. (We have also shot an episode for Windows users, so stay tuned.) Correction: an earlier version of this article confused Butler for Bartender. Both are neat utilities and metaphors for a person who serves you things, but that doesn’t excuse the error, which we regret.",4.0

564199,What would happen if Apple fully banned Facebook from the App Store?,"Apple did something unprecedented this week: it temporarily revoked Facebook’s ability to distribute internal iOS apps, in a punishment to the company. The fast, strong response came after the discovery that Facebook abused its enterprise privileges to install monitoring software on teenagers’ phones. But Apple didn’t wield all of its power. In theory, Apple could have banned Facebook from the consumer-facing App Store entirely — a possible catastrophe for the social platform. The showdown demonstrates how vulnerable the tech giants are to one another, but some developers say that even if Apple made this decision, which it likely won’t, the results might not be as devastating as you’d imagine. The ban would be a “much deserved handicap” on Facebook, but the company would survive it, says Guardian Mobile Firewall security expert Will Strafach, who helped parse Facebook’s teen monitoring app with TechCrunch. That’s because Facebook is more than just one app, giving it some safety; developers also say the company’s sprawling web presence means it’ll never really be gone from iOS. Apple couldn’t simply ban all of Facebook with a button click. It would have to ban every developer account that spans Facebook’s app portfolio, which means banning the accounts for Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook itself, among those for other, smaller apps. That would be an unusual move, too, since Apple typically blocks developers on a per-app basis, rather than as a full account, iOS developer Phill Farrugia tells The Verge. If Apple went through with it, Facebook would have few options — none of them good — for getting its app onto iOS devices. Facebook could use something called internal development certificates, which are designed for in-house beta testing, Farrugia says, but only 100 devices can be added per year. Jailbroken devices could install the app, but most people aren’t jailbreaking their phones, so Facebook couldn’t rely on it. After a ban, Facebook’s best bet would be to encourage people to use its web app, but that has its own disadvantages. For one, native phone apps are often faster and give users an experience they’re used to, iOS developer Kiran Panesar tells The Verge. Web apps are less powerful, too. They don’t offer a comparable push notification system, he says, which is essential for messaging apps, and they can’t access information that a native app could, like a person’s contacts or the ability to track their location in the background. Facebook would have to rethink its mobile web strategy and figure out how to make its web app more powerful and enticing. As someone who uses Facebook in mobile Safari, I can tell you that the current web experience is terrible. The text is small, scrolling is a pain, and everything I’d want to do on the app is slightly more of a struggle. The company also offers Instagram on the web, although you can’t post from it. WhatsApp has a web presence, too. Even without its own apps, Facebook would still have a lot of insight into what’s happening on iOS devices. Its login system is widely used and sends usage data back to Facebook. Facebook also has a web tracker, the Facebook Pixel, that’s on 2.2 million websites, and its Like button appears on 8.4 million sites, following users along the way. That would all help Facebook continue to collect user data and target ads. “Their SDK is in so many apps, and developers send so much analytics data to it for ad targeting,” Panesar says. “Facebook already has an insane understanding of how people use other company’s products.” And then there’s Android. Android may only have a slight edge over iOS in the United States, but it’s far more widely used internationally — and none of those phones would be affected by the ban. At one point in 2017, more than four out of five new phones ran Android. And since the US represents less than a tenth of Facebook’s 2.3 billion monthly users, the impact would be limited. Apple users would be the ones to suffer from a Facebook ban. Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other Facebook properties have been among the top free App Store apps for years. Analysts estimate that they’re also among the most used apps on peoples’ phones, too. Apple would have to be okay with not only angering Facebook, but also disrupting its users’ lives. Without popular apps, the iPhone doesn’t do nearly as much. While unlikely, Facebook is aware that being banned is a risk. In a filing with the SEC in October, Facebook said its lack of control over the platforms it’s on presents a threat to its business. “[Any] changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners ... could adversely affect the usage of Facebook” and its ability to monetize, the company wrote. If it became more difficult to access Facebook, “our user growth and user engagement could be harmed.” Apple is happy to knock Facebook for its lax privacy practices here and there, but it isn’t completely gunning for the company. That means a full Facebook ban isn’t likely to happen. Apple may not like Facebook, but it’s reliant on the rival tech giant, too.",3.5
574438,Jamie Lynn Spears on 'Almost Losing' Daughter Maddie,"Ten months after her daughter’s ATV accident, Jamie Lynn Spears is again celebrating the two people responsible for saving her little girl. The country music singer reflected on the difficult year which saw her almost lose her daughter, Maddie, when the then 8-year-old flipped her ATV into a pond and nearly drowned on Feb. 5. On Monday, Spears, 26, shared a photo from June of her daughter along with the paramedics who rushed to Maddie’s aid, Victoria Ragoonath and John Fortner, whom the singer calls “angels.” “The hardest milestone me and my family have ever faced was almost losing our beautiful Maddie, but thanks to God and the two angels in this picture we were able to celebrate Maddie turning 9 years old all together,” Spears wrote in the caption. “This milestone became a true miracle, and we are forever grateful for that. #12DaysOfJLS.” The two paramedics attended Maddie’s 9th birthday party in June, with Spears thanking them in an Instagram post at the time. “My baby is 9 years old today, and more than ever we realize how precious every day is. So, we have to thank these 2 HEROS  John and Victoria are the first responders, who literally saved Maddie’s life, and they were able to celebrate her another year of her life with us this past weekend!” she captioned a separate photo of the two with the birthday girl. “Thank God for these amazing people, and thank you God for your amazing grace,” Spears added. “We are so blessed today, and every day with this little angel! HAPPY BIRTHDAY MADDIE.” Maddie was in a coma but made a full recovery and showed no signs of neurological damage. Spears’ daughter crashed the ATV into a pond on Spears and stepdad Jamie Watson’s Kentwood, Louisiana, property. The ATV flipped over, and the country artist’s daughter was submerged for several minutes as Spears and others attempted to free her from the vehicle’s safety netting and seat belt. The paramedics managed to get to the property and free the girl just in time. Maddie was airlifted to Children’s Hospital in New Orleans, regaining consciousness two days later and returning home Feb. 10. “When she woke up, they said that it was obvious that she recognized them all,” a friend of Aldridge said. “Everybody was crying because it was such a miracle.”",4.5
578133,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-SecureWorks raises $112 million in year's first technology IPO,"(Corrects IPO size in headline and first paragraph to $112 million from $120 million) By Lauren Hirsch April 21 (Reuters) - Dell Inc’s cyber security unit SecureWorks Corp raised $112 million in the first U.S. initial public offering of a technology company in 2016, less than it had hoped for, amid investor skepticism over its profit margins and prospects. Market jitters and fluctuations in technology stocks have kept investors skittish about the sector. This time last year, six technology companies had already priced their IPOs, raising a total of $1.6 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. SecureWorks priced 8 million shares on Thursday at $14, missing its previously indicated $15.50-$17.50 range, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company was originally aiming to price 9 million shares. The source asked not to be identified ahead of an official announcement. SecureWorks did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Technology investors are hoping SecureWorks will open the door for other IPOs in the sector. Technology companies such as storage provider Nutanix Inc have kept their IPO plans on hold, waiting for a more favorable market environment. In November, payment provider Square Inc completed an IPO that valued it at $2.9 billion, nearly half of the $6 billion valuation that private investors had previously assigned to it. Founded in 1999, SecureWorks helps small- and medium-sized businesses manage their security services and protect their networks. Large technology and services firms have bought many of SecureWorks’ rivals in recent years such as Solutionary, Trustwave and SilverSky. It has 4,200 clients in 59 countries. Cyber security companies captured investors’ attention last year, amid a spate of high profile hacker attacks. Nevertheless, several of the cybersecurity companies that went public in recent years have faltered in the public market. Firms such as FireEye continue to trade under their 2013 IPO price. Several security companies remain on deck for an IPO. SoftOptiv Security LLC and Blue Coat Systems Inc have both hired investment banks for IPOs expected to come later this year. The IPO comes as its parent company Dell Inc, which purchased SecureWorks in 2011, is awaiting approval for its proposed acquisition of EMC Corp. SecureWorks has said it will use proceeds from the offering to fund growth initiatives and not support Dell’s own business. SecureWorks shares are scheduled to start trading on Nasdaq on Friday under the symbol “SCWX.” Bank of America Corp, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co are among the underwriters for SecureWorks’ IPO.

585943,Colin Farrell On Son with Special Needs Taking First Steps,"  Colin Farrell is opening up about one of the most special moments of his life. The 41-year-old actor, who stars in the dark drama The Killing of a Sacred Deer, stopped by the PEOPLE, Entertainment Weekly and InStyle studio at the Toronto International Film Festival with costar Nicole Kidman and director Yorgos Lanthimos. Farrell, who plays a father given a terrible choice in the movie, shared a joyful story from his real life as a dad. “When James took his first steps a couple weeks short of his fourth birthday, it was pretty amazing and humbling to see,” Farrell says. The actor’s firstborn son, who turns 14 next week, has a rare genetic disorder called Angelman syndrome, which causes motor and developmental disabilities, among other symptoms.. Farrell says that while any child taking their first steps is a momentous occasion, it meant even to him knowing his son worked hard to reach that milestone. “People talk about the children taking the first step, it’s obviously a monumental moment and it’s been represented in film,” Farrell says. “But to be told your child may never take the first step and then see those first steps is just kind of a different sport all together.” WATCH: Armie Hammer on How His Daughter is Getting Along With His New Baby Boy: ‘They Just Cuddle!’   Farrell then jokingly tells Kidman to “beat that,” but she responds that her two youngest daughters with husband Keith Urban have put a gag order on telling stories about them. “I’m not allowed to talk right now about my children because they’re becoming aware of what I say and it gets reported back to them so I’ve been silenced,” Kidman admits. “I’m just very, very proud of them and would love to be able to discuss them, but have been told to cut it out.”",4.0

595335,Employees Who Were Fired Because of Social Media Posts,"Behold: 20 great reasons to A) use Pentagon-level security settings on your social media accounts and B) not post horrible things – courtesy of Reddit.    1. “A former colleague of mine posted about how he was going to use up all his sick leave then quit. He posted it at 9 a.m., and was told he didn’t have a job at 11 a.m.”    2. “I had to fire someone for this. He was a volunteer firefighter and left for a call which I allowed. Fifteen minutes later someone showed me his five minute-old post of him riding quads saying something along the lines of ‘Sometimes you just need to F-off from work.’ That put him on a final warning. He then left because he said HIS house was on fire then half-an-hour later his wife tagged him in a photo of him sitting in a kiddie pool in front of his house. The funny thing is, in both cases, if he had simply asked to leave early I probably would have said yes.”   3. “I work in a hospital and there was a police shooting in my area a couple of years ago. Multiple officers were brought into our ER. One officer was DOA and a number of idiot hospital employees posted condolences on their Facebook pages with the name of the officer before the family was officially informed. Seven or eight employees were rightfully fired for that one.”    4. “I once didnt get a job since I don’t have Facebook/etc. Apparently they wanted to see the kind of person I was, and I told them I like my privacy.”   5. “A prospective employee at the company I work for had just passed his interview, and was told that all he needs to do is pass a drug test and a physical and he would start on Monday. Someone found the new hire on Facebook and the guy had just posted 20 minutes after the interview, ‘S—! Anyone know how to pass a drug test in 24 hours?!&apos”    6. “I had to fire an employee for a tweet he wrote about a customer. He tweeted ‘(customer’s full name) would be a great name for a porn star.’ I found out about it when the customer’s lawyer called me the next day threatening action. Turns out the guy worked for the local newspaper and obsessively searched his name on all social media.”   7. “I was younger and an idiot. I posted something on facebook about wanting to go home and play The Sims so I could create [telecommunications store I worked for] on it and then slowly kill off all the customers. I was working a late night shift in a mall and forgot our new coworker had added me on Facebook days before.”    8. “I worked in tech assistance at an electronics store in college. A coworker was fired when a famous actor came in and she posted a lot of his private info on Facebook. Like ‘[Full name of actor] came into our store and bought this and this and has a black Amex card’ and stuff he had on his computer … not once but on 2 separate occasions.”   9. “One of my Facebook friends worked for the postal service in my town. She posted about how she wanted to kill her boss and went into some gory details. Then, about 5 hours later, she posted another status about how the Feds showed up at her house and that one of her coworkers had showed her boss the status and she was now fired. She’s obviously really dumb.”    10. “Guy at my company got sacked for putting a Facebook status along the lines of ‘f-ng immigrants, I hate them’ not realizing both his bosses (also owners of the company) were second generation immigrants from India. They started the company from scratch and now employ 30 people. They pay for full gym membership, healthcare, and generous pension for all the staff, which he had to say goodbye to when he was fired.”   11. “I worked for a place that has a giftshop. Inside of this gift shop were the most ugly, unwearable scarves on the face of the planet. I was younger and didn’t really care about the company or any possible consequences.I started a movement called ‘Scarf Tuesday.’ Basically, a few of us (on the clock) would meet up at 9 every Tuesday and wear a scarf for a photo on Facebook. These photos started getting likes and people loved them, so we kept going.   A few months later, I get pulled into my bosses office. On the wall  are at least twenty of the scarf Tuesday pictures WITH THE FACES BLURRED OUT. My boss asks me, to this day, the funniest question I’ve ever been asked: ‘What do you see here?’ I smiled and told him it looked like employees wearing scarves.   He said he found it ‘hilarious’ but it was unacceptable and he was disappointed. Apparently somebody watching the cameras wasn’t happy and watched us for weeks piling evidence. Everybody  had similar meetings in the next few days. I didn’t get canned right away because we stopped doing Scarf Tuesday, but the retaliation was awful and eventually I was blamed for just about everything that went wrong and got fired.”   12. “A co-worker of mine was fired recently because he got caught sneaking off from work to smoke weed and drink. This moron would post post photos of him smoking and drinking on Facebook. The boss found out and predictably fired him on the spot. This guy was almost 30-years-old.”    13. “A girl I know was a nurse at a hospital and got fired for posting things on Facebook such as: ‘Soooooo sleepy here in the ICU. Will someone please code and give me something exciting to do? #isthatbad?’ and a lot of racist things.  The dumbest part about it was she was TAGGING the hospital she worked at in her posts”   14. “I posted a blog post on MySpace in 2005 that got me discharged from the Army. I indicated I had romantic feelings for a female and that I had acted on those feelings (I am also female). My sergeant suspected I was involved with this woman so she looked me up on MySpace, saw the blog post, and 3 months later, I was discharged for ‘homosexual conduct.&apos”    15. “Joined a games studio alongside a guy who’d just finished his philosophy degree. He felt that the game’s official forums were the best place to discuss whether disabled people would be ‘Of as much value as pigs’ after a post-apocalyptic event, and if they should be simply slaughtered and eaten. All using his company account, of course.”   16. “My female friend (18) was DM’d through Twitter by the news presenter (37) of our city. He was talking about her beach pictures and how she is really pretty and how they need to get together.  He lost his job later that week, mostly because he used the wheather channel’s Twitter account.”   17. “My mom’s ex boyfriend was a waiter at a very elite restaurant and normally got very nice tips. Some guy left him a $5 tip for an over $100 bill and he got mad and posted the customer’s information on Facebook. He got fired the next day.”   18. “I was let go from the nations third largest insurance company for what were called ‘offensive tweets.’ Apparently someone with a name similar to mine was tweeting vulgar things to comedy accounts and they brought me into HR and terminated me. I sued for wrongful termination and won.”    19. “It was my first week on the job a week at a law firm, and had to ride with one of the female employees to the UPS store. She was a terrible driver, and almost wrecked multiple times. I posted on Facebook, ‘One week on the job and my coworker is trying to kill me; worst driver ever.’ The next day I was called into my bosses office with the girl sitting there with an expressionless look on her face, and there was a printout of my post. It was awkward and they fired me on the spot. All of my account information was also set to private, so they figured a way to check my activity.”   20. “A few years ago I knew a girl doing social media for a pastry company. Well, this was also around the time of the Casey Anthony trial, and the day the verdict was released she tweeted ‘Who’s #notguilty about eating all the tasty treats they want?!’   It SERIOUSLY blew up and she ended up getting fired a few days later. She was pretty upset about it for a while, but tells the story at parties now and gets that it’s pretty funny.”   Stories have been edited from Reddit for length and clarity.",4.0
597761,Prince William Sounds Off on Social Media Pressures,"Prince William is echoing his brother Prince Harry‘s sentiments on the pressures of social media on kids and young adults. The royal dad gave a passionate speech at a circus-themed gala Monday night, celebrating the partnership between The Children’s Trust, an organization that helps children with brain injuries, and one of his key charities, Skillforce. “The pressure on young people these days is considerable — almost certainly more than even for my generation not so long ago,” he said. “Children are tested more than ever before and are being prepared to enter a highly competitive work market,” he continued. “On top of this, there is a sense of being ‘on call’ 24/7 through social media, and the subsequent strains this can have on relationships, home life and, ultimately, a child’s sense of their own self-worth. It can all take its toll.” During a mental health event last month, Prince Harry spoke out about the same issue, saying, “People are spending far too much time online and it’s like a mental running machine that they can’t get off.

606266,Megyn Kelly: 'No One Believes' Trump Didn't Know About Daniels Payout,"Megyn Kelly isn’t buying the claim that Donald Trump’s lawyer and “fixer” Michael Cohen never told the now-president about a $130,000 payment he made to porn star Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about their alleged sexual encounter. Speaking to Cohen’s attorney David Schwartz on Megyn Kelly Today Thursday, the host disputed that Cohen used his own money for the payout — made the month before the 2016 presidential election — without informing Trump or seeking reimbursement. “No one believes that, David,” she said as the audience laughed and applauded. “Lots of people believe it. If you understand the dynamics of the relationship,” Shwartz responded, before being cut off by Kelly. “Michael Cohen had great authority within that organization to take care of things.”  The former Fox News anchor argued that Trump has much more money than Cohen, but Schwartz explained that Cohen made a decision to act given that they were just weeks out from Election Day. Cohen “chose not to go to the boss; he chose to take care of this thing” due to his “love” and “loyalty” for Trump, Schwartz said. Kelly also asked if Cohen was behind an alleged threat Daniels detailed on 60 Minutes, in which she says a man in Las Vegas approached her and her infant daughter after she spoke to In Touch magazine in May 2011 for $15,000 dollars. (The interview was shelved for years due to threatened legal action.) “Of course he didn’t order it,” Schwartz replied. “Of course he didn’t order it.” Michael Cohen's attorney, David Schwartz, says in response to question asking if Cohen ordered alleged threat against Stormy Daniels in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011 pic.twitter.com/KkkuLvD6OW — TODAY (@TODAYshow) March 29, 2018  He also brushed off talk that Cohen makes threats in general. “I’ve heard that through the grapevine, but I don’t think threats. He speaks very strong,” Schwartz said. “If you call enforcement of a damages clause in a contract a threat where two attorneys are speaking to each other. If [Stormy Daniels’ attorney] Michael Avenatti considers that a threat, I feel sorry for him.” The interview comes the same week the TV host shared excerpts from her 2016 book in which Cohen reportedly sternly warned a Daily Beast writer against covering Trump’s divorce from first wife Ivana, including a claim that he raped his wife. After reading Cohen’s written threat to kill the story, Schwartz said his client was reacting to the intimidation against Trump. “Everybody should want an employee like this who would be so loyal to your boss that you will protect that person,” the lawyer added. In addition to Cohen’s warnings to the writer, Kelly also recalled an incident when Cohen retweeted numerous threatening messages, including a person who wrote “#boycottmegynkelly @realDonaldTrump we can gut her.” “Gut her,” Kelly wrote in her book. “For the first time, I felt alarmed.” Cohen initially denied paying Daniels for the nondisclosure agreement, but later admitted to it, calling it a “private transaction” and claiming it didn’t violate any campaign finance laws. Cohen and Trump continue to deny that the affair took place. In addition to Daniels, Trump is embroiled in allegations that he had an affair with former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal while married to Melania in 2006. The White House has also denied that affair.",5.0

608501,"Ex-Oklahoma City Cop to Be Sentenced for Sex Crimes, Faces Up to 263 Years","A former Oklahoma City police officer could be sentenced to as much as 263 years in prison Thursday after being convicted last month of rape and other charges, PEOPLE confirms.    Daniel Holtzclaw, 29, was found guilty of 18 counts in all, including first-degree rape, forcible oral sodomy, sexual battery, procuring lewd exhibition and second-degree rape, according to court records obtained by PEOPLE.    The jury in the case recommended a total of 263 years in jail, including 30 years for each of four first-degree rape counts. He was found not guilty on an additional 18 counts.    District judge Timothy Henderson will decide Thursday whether Holtzclaw will have to serve his sentences consecutively, reports the Associated Press.    Prosecutors said Holtzclaw used his position of authority to prey on women in a low-income neighborhood near the state capitol, forcing himself upon them after stopping them while on patrol to check for outstanding warrants or drug paraphernalia.    The state also emphasized the racial aspect to the case – Holtzclaw is half-white, half-Japanese, while all of his victims were black.    • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

609595,Lena Dunham Stars in NSFW 'Tattoo' Video for Love Magazine,"Lena Dunham knows firsthand that sometimes love fades, so it is only fitting that her newest body ink of the four-letter word will also fade over time. The actress, 31, shared a video on Monday from her Love magazine shoot in which she got a fake tattoo of the word “Love” in the middle of her back. While the tattoo was a temporary one, it was not the only thing she was faking in the suggestive clip. Wearing a teal latex bodysuit, Dunham dramatically went through climactic highs and lows as she got her “ink”, biting her lip and moaning as the tattoo artist – played by sculptor David Alexander Flinn – worked on her back. The actress also sported a mohawk hairstyle, which was just like the ‘do she had back in June 2017 when she got a buzz cut. Her video comes one day after she shared a topless photo in which she covered her assets with her hands while wearing only a pair of sweatpants and showing off her Rihanna-inspired underboob tattoo that she previously got in March 2017.

Dunham has previously been candid about her nine real tattoos including a picture of Ferdinand the bull, Laura Thornhill, the first female skateboarder, an image of Eloise as a tramp stamp and an illustration of a children’s book. Last February, Dunham told Vogue‘s “73 Questions” that she’s looking forward to getting another tattoo from her former Girls costar Jemima Kirke. She previously inked a picture of her dog, Rosie, onto Dunham and for their next collaboration, Kirke said she’s planning to tattoo the word “nasty” on Dunham’s butt. Earlier this month, Dunham revealed she’s both physically and emotionally on the mend after undergoing a total hysterectomy last year. The news of her procedure was shared just over a month after PEOPLE confirmed she split from her boyfriend of five years, Jack Antonoff, in January. Though they ended their relationship, Antonoff praised his ex-girlfriend for her Vogue essay about her hysterectomy, calling it a “beautiful piece” on Twitter. Most recently, the singer was spotted out with frequent collaborator Lorde in her native Auckland, New Zealand, though a source told PEOPLE:  “There’s not any type of romantic situation. They’re just friends — they really are just friends.”",4.5

Foster, 37, caught up with reporters at Rachel Zoe’s Spring 2019 Presentation and Dinner at the Hotel Bel Air where she explained why she loves Garner, 46, so much — and why she wants to get her on Bumble, the dating app.  “I love Jen and she to me is my total girl crush,” she said. “She’s the best. She can cook, she can really do it all, she can like, kick your butt and she’s beautiful and she’s the best mom.

Comments by Celebs was first to spot the comment. “What do I have to do to get you on Bumble and have this be your profile pic?” Foster wrote, prompting Garner to reply: “You can have this for the poster.” Garner has been focusing on her three kids — Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6 — ever since her 2015 split from Ben Affleck. She’s also making her return to action in the thriller Peppermint, out Friday. The actress opened up about letting her children use social media apps in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday. “My kids don’t have any social media yet, and I am terrified,” she said. “I think it puts so, so much pressure on kids at an age when they’re really vulnerable anyway.” Garner and Affleck, who wed in 2005, announced their separation after 10 years of marriage and filed for divorce in April 2017.",3.5
615458,"Joey Buttafuoco and Amy Fisher: 25 Years Later, Where Are They Now?","They were household names: Amy Fisher. Mary Jo Buttafuoco. Joey Buttafuoco. On May 19, 1992, Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot in the head on the front porch of her home in Massapequa, New York. The shooter: 17-year-old Fisher, a high school student who was having an affair with Mary Jo’s husband, Joey. Miraculously, Mary Jo survived the attack. As the media swarmed their quiet neighborhood, all three members of the lover’s triangle became nationally-known personalities. Fisher was dubbed the “Long Island Lolita.” With his tough-talking exterior, Joey was known as the villain. And Mary Jo was considered the innocent housewife caught up in her husband’s infidelities. As the 25th anniversary of the crime approaches, the case is the subject of a new TV show, Scandal Made Me Famous, on the Reelz Network. In the show, Mary Jo Buttafuoco recalls the attack — and how she’s doing today. The show also gives updates on the lives of the three people involved in one of the most sordid scandals of the ’90s. Mary Jo Buttafuoco Now 61, Mary Jo has moved on with her life. She divorced her husband in 2003, and is living a quiet life away from the spotlight — except for the occasional TV appearance. In 2010, she released a book, Getting It Through My Thick Skull: Why I Stayed, What I Learned, and What Millions of People Involved with Sociopaths Need to Know. She still grapples with her injuries: she is partially paralyzed on one side of her face and deaf in one ear. Because surgery would have been too dangerous, the bullet remains lodged in her neck. Amy Fisher After spending seven years in jail for assault, Fisher was released in 1999. She briefly worked as a columnist for the Long Island Press. She married Louis Bellera in 2003 and had three children. (The couple divorced last year.)  She wrote a 2004 book about her experiences, If I Knew Then. In 2007, after a sex tape emerged, Fisher began a brief career in adult entertainment. She starred in her own pay-per-view adult film entitled Amy Fisher: Totally Nude & Exposed, and made a handful of other adult movies. She walked away from the industry in 2011. Now 42, Fisher lives in Florida. She has occasionally spoken out about the Buttafuocos, and has even made public appearances with them over the years.

621777,7 Breastfeeding-in-Public Shaming Horror Stories (and How Women Are Fighting to Normalize It),"Women are constantly subjected to unsolicited criticism and shaming for how and where they choose to feed their babies. While the choice is entirely theirs, loved ones and strangers (even doctors!) alike seem to believe that they’re entitled to share their own (often unkind or forceful) suggestions. If a mother is unable or chooses not to breastfeed, she’s often made to feel guilty or inadequate. If she does breastfeed, she’s likely to at some point be told to cover up or go somewhere “more private.” If covering up is how she feels most comfortable, she may even receive backlash for that. It seems that no matter how a mother chooses to feed her child, she faces societal pressures and shaming that desperately need to be eradicated. Now that Utah and Idaho have finally passed laws to protect nursing mothers, breastfeeding in public is officially legal across the United States — something that nursing mothers are forced time and again to remind judgmental strangers of, especially when they’re finding themselves breastfeeding in some unusual places. Below, real moms share their worst confrontations with breastfeeding shamers, and how they’ve channeled those experiences into the fight to normalize breastfeeding. Brittni Medina was waiting in a long line with her 10-month-old son to get their picture taken with characters at Disneyland when he grew hungry. “I wasn’t going to wait in another line again. So I took off my first top and nursed,” she wrote on Facebook. “These women were making snarky comments so I moved from my spot to catch a picture with these characters. Not for attention for me but attention to the fact NO WOMEN SHOULD BE SHAMED FOR FEEDING THEIR BABY UNCOVERED,” she continued. While the responses to her post were mostly supportive, some women encouraged her to be more discreet. “Disney policy and the law fully support me,” Medina responded. “Boobs are not sexual!” She pointed out, “Am I normally this ‘exposed’ when I feed my son? No! But not all moments as a mother are glamorous!” “I never expected the picture to go viral,” Medina said, but she sees it as realistic and hopes that it can help to normalize breastfeeding in public. “Obviously it’s not the best one of me but I love it because again not all mom moments are [glamorous].” Jennifer Howard was shocked after her new doctor asked her to cover up while breastfeeding during a check up to discuss postpartum depression. Howard’s 3-month-old daughter started crying during the appointment, so “I did what any mom would do: I picked her up and attempt to nurse her,” she told KOIN News. Her doctor immediately stopped her and asked if she had a cover, which prompted her to ask if she’d heard him correctly. “And he said, ‘Yes, to cover yourself while you’re breastfeeding.’ I said, ‘Well, no doctor has ever asked me to do that before,’ and he said, ‘Well, it’s a rule we have to prevent lawsuits from something inappropriate,&apos” Howard said. After she found a cover in her bag, the doctor took it from her hands and proceeded “to hold it up and shield me while I got my baby latched, and then, he took it and covered me and my baby with it,” Howard shared. Howard later called the clinic’s patient services only to learn there was no such policy in place. She decided to file a complaint with the clinic and asked for a new doctor, but her request was refused. She’s sharing her story in hopes of helping to normalize breastfeeding in public. “Parenting is hard enough as it is, and we don’t need this. Women don’t need this,” she said.  As Bobee Carroll was nursing her 3-month-old daughter at a Buffalo Wild Wings, the restaurant manager approached and asked if she had a cover, as it was making their waiter uncomfortable. When Carroll informed her that she didn’t have a cover, the manager offered a fleece blanket, to which Carroll replied that it was illegal to tell her to cover up. Louisiana state law allows women to breastfeed in public, and it is considered discrimination to stop them from doing so. Carroll and her husband were later put in touch with a corporate representative for the chain, and Buffalo Wild Wings’ parent company, JK&T Wings, Inc. & Subsidiaries, also emailed them to apologize for the incident. “We are certainly going to take this opportunity to educate and prepare our Team Members throughout our entire system, in order to show discretion and sensitivity in these matters in the future,” Jean Lanfear, the company’s vice president of human resources, said in the email, according to KTAL. Afterwards, Bobee organized a sit-in at the restaurant in order to raise awareness, rather than protest the location. “We’re just going to be a bunch of moms enjoying our dinner and taking care of our babies,” she said. “We want breastfeeding to be normalized. It shouldn’t be sexualized. We want women to know their rights and we want the companies to know they can’t interfere with that.” While participating in a “parent and tot” gym class with her almost-2-year-old daughter, Monica Makey took a break to breastfeed. She was quickly stopped by an employee who told her her “breast milk could stain the mats,” and that she couldn’t nurse in that area because of the gym’s food and drink policy. Makey then asked if she could breastfeed in the area where the kids keep their water bottles, but was again turned down. While the gym’s co-owner later apologized to her in person and the facility issued an apology on their Facebook page, Makey’s frustration over how the incident was handled remains. “Many people believe they are supportive of breastfeeding but most do not understand that it is our legal human right to breastfeed WHEREVER and WHENEVER — no exceptions. Especially not because of a ridiculous ‘food and drink policy,&apos” she wrote on Facebook. “I ask that you please SHARE this post in hopes of educating everyone on this very important matter. Clearly, work still needs to be done in supporting and normalizing breastfeeding.” Stephanie Hicks filed and won a discrimination case against the Alabama state police department after they demoted her and refused to provide proper breastfeeding accommodations when she returned from maternity leave. She had been forced to pump in the station’s locker room, which she said “was awful.” She continued, “Sitting there by the shower stall, where the dispatchers and the public could walk in. Somebody was always asking what I was doing.” Her coworkers often called her radio while she was pumping, telling her to “wrap those boobs up” and get back to work. “I felt defeated,” Hicks said. “Breastfeeding is hard enough in itself, especially your first time. You finally get the hang of it and then you face all these obstacles. And to have zero support, you feel almost embarrassed — like why am I even doing this?” She explained that she decided to sue in order to help other working moms. “So many people have reached out to me and said they were treated similarly, whether they were paramedics or teachers or bank tellers,” she said. “They all say the same thing: I was afraid, I couldn’t afford to quit my job, I didn’t want to be retaliated against. Fighting the system is very hard.”  A nursing mom shared in the Breastfeeding Mama Talk Facebook group that she was planning to attend the wedding of her husband’s best friend — until she received the invitation, which included a special note to those breastfeeding. “To all our mommies who are breastfeeding, we are thinking of you; we are sensitive to the fact that you may need to breastfeed during our event, therefore we have designated an appropriate place for you to feed your baby so that you do not have to do so in public in front of our Family and Friends,” part of the notice read. The mother, who wishes to remain anonymous, felt confident that she was the only one to receive the note, as the bride had previously “voiced that I need to go elsewhere to do that in ‘private!&apos” She mused in her post, “I still can’t see why a nursing mom is ‘banished’ to bathrooms or other areas unless she chooses to go there for HER and BABY [sic] comfort.” The post garnered almost 800 shares, with fellow mothers voicing their support and outrage over the incident. Ashley McCall organized a nurse-in at a Walmart in Idaho after she was kicked out for breastfeeding her infant son. “I sat down on a bench, in a fairly secluded area, and started trying to nurse him,” McCall wrote on Facebook. “After about five minutes a clerk came up to me and asked me to leave. I asked if I could take him to the bench in the bathroom and was told that it would be better if I just took him home.” Idaho, at the time, was the only state without laws in place to protect nursing mothers — but Wal-Mart’s policy permits breastfeeding in stores. McCall ended up nursing in her car, where neither she nor her baby were comfortable, she said. “Babies should be able to nurse whenever they’re hungry, wherever they’re hungry, and however they and their mom are most comfortable,” McCall told PEOPLE. “Nursing parents in Idaho need laws that protect them,” she continued, which was why she organized the nurse-in. “That’s what I’m fighting for,” she added, “Babies need to eat. Plain and simple.” Her efforts were not in vain — Idaho officially passed laws in line with the rest of the country to support public breastfeeding in February 2018.",2.5
624779,Rowing: Surgery puts Tokyo 2020 into fresh focus for champion Satch,"LONDON (Reuters) - Heart surgery and then a shoulder operation came as “a bit of a kick in the teeth” for 2016 Olympic champion rower Will Satch last year but time off the water has provided fresh focus for the hard slog toward next year’s Tokyo Games. The 29-year-old from Britain’s rowing heartland of Henley-on-Thames stroked Britain’s men’s eight to gold at the Rio de Janeiro Games and says he is now fully motivated and ready for more. “Having time away has just made me appreciate what it is and why I do it,” he told Reuters. Satch underwent heart surgery a year ago to treat the hereditary condition of atrial fibrillation, while a ruptured shoulder has kept him mostly on an exercise bike since December. The heart problem, previously managed with tablets, had become increasingly an issue ahead of Rio and had to be addressed. “If I’m honest, I just wanted to get Rio done and then I was going to get out,” said Satch at the launch of the SAS Ranking Points Index, which aims to help identify future elite talent as well as making club rowing closer and fairer. “A lot of my friends retired and it would have been very easy to follow suit. “But I’m potentially a little bit masochistic...I enjoy the pain and the training and I like building camaraderie. I do miss the old guys but now we’ve got this new group and I’m really excited to try and do it again in a different way.” Satch tells a story about veteran Olympic rowing coach Juergen Grobler, a famous task-master, that shines a light on the team spirit within what has become a medal machine for Britain. In Rio, while team mates savored their moment in the media spotlight, the dehydrated athlete spent an hour and a half trying to provide a urine sample in the confines of an air-conditioned room. Grobler, a former East German who has mentored champions at every Olympics since Munich in 1972 and can claim to be the most successful coach in world sport, waited outside. At the end, the two men walked away together. “I was like ‘We are going to have this conversation now, we’re on. This is going to be an emotional moment,’” recalled Satch with a smile. “And we’re walking back and I probably got 15-20 seconds out of him, and the walk was 10 minutes long. And in my head I was thinking ‘I’ve just trained four years to get a smile out of this man’. “I got it, but it was very short-lived. And potentially that’s why I’m back. “I want it again. A few seconds.” Now 72, Grobler has hinted he will retire after the Tokyo Games and is likely to add to the list of 33 gold medalists under his watch so far. With Britain, he has personally coached gold medal-winning crews at every Games since 1992 — the first two with five-times gold medalist Steve Redgrave and four-times champion Matthew Pinsent. “He’s as passionate as ever. And that’s the biggest thing. You’ve got to have passion. Without passion, what’s the point?,” said Satch. “He doesn’t even need to say that much. It’s just having that inspiration around you is very special.” Satch’s own future looks likely to lie more with the four than the eight when it comes to Tokyo selection. Winner of a bronze medal with George Nash in the pairs at his home 2012 London Olympics, Satch joined Moe Sbihi, Matthew Tarrant and Matt Rossiter in the coxless four that took bronze at the 2017 world championships in Florida. “I just want to be in the top boat, whatever that is,” he said. “I’m very excited about the eight although I’ve been there and done it. The pair is a very special boat to me, my debut was the Olympics with my best friend in that boat. “And then the four is something I haven’t really done. I haven’t had a fair crack at it because I had that heart issue leading into the 2017 worlds. “I feel like I could potentially do any boat if I am at my best.” Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Toby Davis",4.0

Rouhani seemed to be referring to possible negotiations with the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal with Iran last year but has said he is willing to hold talks with the Islamic Republic. “As long as I have the responsibility for the executive duties of the country, we are completely ready for just, legal and honest negotiations to solve the problems,” Rouhani said, according to his official website. “But at the same time we are not ready to sit at the table of surrender under the name of negotiations.” Reporting By Babak Dehghanpisheh; Editing by Gareth Jones",4.5
627931,"Niki Lauda, 3-Time Formula 1 Champion, Dies at 70","Niki Lauda, a three-time Formula 1 champion who survived a horrific crash that caused severe burns to his face, died on Monday at the age of 70. The former Ferrari racer — who would go on to start several airline companies after retiring from the sport — underwent a lung transplant in 2018 after being diagnosed with “severe lung disease,” and was hospitalized with influenza this year, according to CNN. Lauda previously had two kidney transplants, one from his brother in 1997 and one from his girlfriend in 2005, Fox News reported. Lauda’s cause of death was not publicly announced by the family. “His unique successes as a sportsman and entrepreneur are and will stay in our memory,” the Lauda family said in a statement, according to the outlet. “His tireless zest for action, his straightforwardness and his courage remain a role model and standard for all of us. Away from the public, he was a loving and caring husband, father and grandfather. We will miss him.” Lauda lost much of his right ear and hair when he was involved in a fiery crash German Grand Prix in 1976. But the ever-determined Austrian racer would return to the track just six weeks later, still wearing bandages around his injured face, to finish fourth at the 1976 Italian Grand Prix. He later admitted he was terrified of returning so quickly to racing, but felt it was the best way to help his mental healing. “I said then and later that I had conquered my fear quickly and cleanly,” Lauda wrote in his autobiography, To Hell And Back, the BBC noted. “That was a lie. But it would have been foolish to play into the hands of my rivals by confirming my weakness. At Monza, I was rigid with fear.” Lauda would then win his second F1 championship the next year, and his third in 1984. His heated rivalry with British McLaren racer James Hunt was the subject of Ron Howard‘s 2013 film, Rush, starring Chris Hemsworth as Hunt and Daniel Brühl as Lauda. Hunt was seen as a handsome, Hollywood movie star-esque racer, putting him directly in contrast to Lauda’s matter of fact personality. But Lauda and Hunt were good friends, despite turning merciless toward each other when they were behind the wheel. “Rest in peace Niki Lauda. Forever carried in our hearts, forever immortalized in our history,” the Formula 1 Twitter account said after his death. “The motorsport community today mourns the devastating loss of a true legend. The thoughts of everyone at F1 are with his friends and family.” Added Ferrari, his former sponsor: “Everyone at Ferrari is deeply saddened at the news of the death of our dear friend Niki Lauda. ‘He won two of his three world championships with us and will always be in our hearts and in those of all Ferrari fans.

631268,Iman Talks For First Time About Death of David Bowie at Tom Ford Show,"Iman has remained largely out of the public eye since the death of husband David Bowie, but on Wednesday the supermodel made an appearance at New York Fashion Week with a sweet reminder of the love of her life.  Iman told fashion stylist and journalist Joe Zee for Good Morning America at the Tom Ford show that she’s adjusting to life after losing her husband and her mother in a span of just three months. “It’s just been a tough year, but I’m holding up,” she said. The 61-year-old model and entrepreneur also revealed she was wearing a gold necklace in memory of Bowie. “I’m wearing this until my death. [Fashion designer] Hedi Slimane made it for me,” she revealed. “It just says ‘David.’ ” “You’re a survivor,” Zee told Iman.  “Not as much as you think,” she replied. The star-studded Tom Ford fashion show marks Iman’s first night out since the music icon died of cancer at age 69 in January.  She documented getting ready for her “first night out since last year” on Instagram with a selfie featuring her own line of cosmetics. Iman also snapped a photo with fellow supermodel Cindy Crawford. “Made it my first night out!” she captioned an Instagram photo showing off her blue velvet suit when the night was over. “Thanks @tomford for a very glam but intimate presentation.” Bowie and Iman met in October of 1990, and “they were inseparable” ever since, the couple’s friend, hairstylist Teddy Antolin, told PEOPLE in January.  “They really knew each other because they had come up and traveled in the same circles. They were great together,” Antolin added at the time. “She was a real force and he needed a woman by his side to keep him focused.”  The model and the rocker married in Tuscany after two years together. In 2000, they welcomed their daughter, Alexandria “Lexi” Zahra Jones. His widow and Lexi have remained largely out of the public eye since his death. In February, Iman was photographed for the first time since the the news of the music icon’s death broke when she stepped out in New York City to walk the dog they raised together; then, just days later, she took to social media to express her “love & gratitude” for the outpouring of support she received.  In April, just three months after losing her husband, Iman announced on Instagram her mother, Maryan Baadi, had also died.",4.0
637439,Chris Brown Files Defamation Suit Against Rape Accuser,"Chris Brown has filed a defamation lawsuit against the woman who filed a rape complaint against him in Paris. In documents filed on Thursday and obtained by PEOPLE, the R&B singer accused the woman of “false accusation, committed on Jan. 18, 2019 in Paris…and not prescribed, provided for and punished” by the French Penal Code. Brown, 29, was released from custody without charge on Wednesday, two days after being accused of potential aggravated rape and drug infractions. Though he was released, PEOPLE confirms the investigation into the incident by the Paris police continues. In a strongly worded Instagram post that he’s since deleted, Brown rejected the accusation on Tuesday, saying that it was damaging to both himself and his young daughter, Royalty, who turns 5 in May. “I WANNA MAKE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR…… THIS IS FALSE AND A WHOLE LOT OF CAP [sic]!” Brown captioned a text image that read “This b!tch lyin.’” His statement continued in the caption: “NNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEERRRRRR!!!!!! FOR MY DAUGHTER AND MY FAMILY THIS IS SO DISPRESPECTFUL [sic] AND IS AGAINST MY CHARACTER AND MORALS!!!!!” Brown’s attorney, Raphael Chiche, previously told multiple outlets in a statement, “Chris Brown is free. No lawsuits were filed against him. He vigorously challenges the charges against him. A complaint for slanderous denunciation will be filed with the Public Prosecutor of Paris. The charges against Chris Brown have not been dropped and investigations are still going on but Chris Brown has not been sued by Prosecution.” Since the accusations, Brown has been active on social media, posting videos from his dance rehearsals and screenshots of articles which have headlines about his release from custody. As PEOPLE previously reported, a judicial official told the Associated Press that Brown was detained on potential charges of aggravated rape and drug infractions on Monday. The official said Brown was still in custody on Tuesday, and could remain there for an additional two days while investigators decide whether or not to file preliminary charges, the AP reported. Reuters reported that two other people were arrested with Brown. “We confirm the detention in custody of Mr. Chris Brown and two other individuals on charges of aggravated rape and narcotics offenses. Police custody is still in progress,” the Paris Public Prosecutor’s Office told PEOPLE in a statement. “The judicial action that will be given will not be communicated before the end of the custody.” A source also confirmed Brown’s arrest to PEOPLE. A rep for Brown did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment. Brown was investigated by police after the woman, 24, alleged in a complaint filed to the 1st arrondisement commisseriat that she was raped by Brown at his hotel between Jan. 15 and 16, according to French outlet Closer. She claimed to have met Brown earlier at a nightclub on the street of Rue de Ponthieu. The alleged rape is said to have occurred in Brown’s room at the Mandarin Oriental, which is a luxury hotel near Place Vendôme. The woman additionally claimed that Brown’s friend and his bodyguard also abused her. On Monday, the Shade Room posted a photo of Brown smiling with his rumored girlfriend Ammika Harris while at Le Cirque Club in Paris. On Wednesday, Brown was seen out in Paris for the first time since being released from custody, leaving his hotel dressed in a Nike hat and plaid coat.",4.0

639701,Amanda Seyfried Remembers 'Father Figure' Bill Paxton,"Amanda Seyfried is grieving the sudden loss of her on-screen dad, Bill Paxton. “He was an amazing and supportive father-figure to me in my early career,” she tells PEOPLE. “Incredibly inspired and full of life at every turn, he made you feel like everything was possible. This is a terrible loss.” The actress, 31, starred opposite Paxton, who died at the age of 61, in the polygamy HBO drama Big Love from 2006 to 2011. Other stars have honored the late actor, including Ginnifer Goodwin, who played one of his three wives in Big Love, as well as Jamie Lee Curtis, director James Cameron, Helen Hunt and Bud Cort. Cort, who starred with Paxton in the 1990 thriller Brain Dead, released a statement to PEOPLE saying he’s “not letting go” of the actor. The 68-year-old actor met Paxton in the 1970s when the Twister star was parking cars at the Beverly Hills Hotel, according to Cort’s rep. The two became fast friends and their friendship endured. “All of the laughs and joyful times and deep conversations we’ve shared for so many years are safe in my heart forever,” Cort’s statement read. “You really did it and with such style, class and soul and intelligence and, of course, your incomparable humor.” “It was an honor to be your friend and a privilege to act with you, to make music with you and… most of all, just to hang with you,” he continued. “I love you, Bill. All my prayers and deepest sympathy to Louise, James and Lydia and to your mom and brother and your great dad John, who I know for sure you are with now. God bless you brother.” Paxton died due to complications from surgery. His fame rose in the 1990s thanks to roles such as Morgan Earp in Tombstone(1993), Fred Haise in Apollo 13 (1995), the lead role in the 1996 hit Twister and as treasure hunter Brock Lovett in Titanic (1997).",3.5
641330,Bindi Irwin Shares Father's Day Message for the Late Steve Irwin,"“Nearly 10 years have passed since the untimely death of The Crocodile Hunter star Steve Irwin, but his daughter Bindi‘s bond with her father is as strong as ever.    The former Dancing With the Stars champion took to Instagram on Sunday, to wish her late dad a Happy Father’s Day. The post featured a throwback photo of a young Bindi alongside Steve, waxing a surfboard with the caption: “I love you. I hope I’m making you proud.” Steve died in 2006 after being fatally attacked by a stingray while filming a documentary off the coast of Australia.   Bindi, 17, hasn’t let the memory of her father fade in the slightest. A little over a month ago, she took to Instagram to promote her father’s role in a nonprofit organization called Wildlife Warriors, with a throwback photo of Steve holding a large lizard. Followed by launching the first-ever Steve Irwin Gala Dinner in Los Angeles to raise funds for the organization.     While attending the Gala in May, Bindi told PEOPLE that it’s wonderful to see how her father’s impact touched so many animal rights supporters.   “It’s absolutely wonderful to see everything really come together,” said Bindi. “I think it’s been a huge process of planning, but we’ve loved every minute of it. We wanted to really make sure we captured the event perfectly. Everything that Dad stood for has kind of been showcased tonight, and that means a lot. So we wanted to make sure it was absolutely perfect.”    “I think that Dad was so wonderful because he was like this human hurricane – I can see a lot of that in myself,” she added. “I’m not a very patient person. If I want to do something, I have to do it right now! I kind of share the same love for all wildlife, and all wild places. I think those similarities are really, really strong.”",4.0
650158,China prepares to host the G20 - Olympian exertions,"IF A Martian were to land on earth and be asked, based on effort put into spiffing itself up, which city was the Olympic host this year, there is a good chance it would guess Hangzhou. Rio de Janeiro struggled mightily with its preparations for the summer games, with mixed results. Hangzhou, by contrast, has left no stone unturned, no wall unpainted and no sewer unsealed in getting ready for the G20 Summit, an annual gathering of the leaders of the world’s 20 leading economies. Most hosts treat the G20 as a worthy, if rather dull, conference. But China has approached it with gusto, as is its wont with international events that let it showcase its modernity to the world. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Even if left in its original state, Hangzhou would surely have impressed visiting dignitaries and journalists. Just 40 minutes west of Shanghai by bullet train, it is one of China’s wealthiest cities. The misty waters of West Lake at its heart, fringed by rolling tea fields, have inspired poets for centuries. In recent years, it has become an entrepreneurial hub, most famously as the hometown of Alibaba, an e-commerce company. But the G20 summit, to be held on September 4th and 5th, will be the first in China in the eight-year history of such meetings and a hugely important diplomatic occasion for President Xi Jinping. He clearly hopes that the event will highlight how central China has become to solving the world’s problems. (It will also involve what is likely to be his last meeting with Barack Obama before next year’s change of presidency in America, and may provide yet another opportunity to cosy up to Vladimir Putin of Russia.) So the government is leaving nothing to chance. The city has plastered signs on lampposts and buses welcoming the G20 and exhorting residents to be on their best behaviour. Petrol stations alongside major arteries have been hidden behind new walls. Public offices will close for a special seven-day holiday. Private businesses have been urged to do the same, even though the summit itself only runs for two days. Hangzhou residents will receive 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) in tourism vouchers to visit other cities in Zhejiang province (of which Hangzhou is the capital) during the G20. The city has also mobilised its masses. The mayor boasts that a 760,000-strong volunteer force stands ready to serve the G20. That number seems implausibly high for the summit alone, equating to a ratio of roughly 100 volunteers for every attendee. But it might just be true, if it includes all the students and retirees who will help patrol city streets during the meetings, whether to stop people from littering and jaywalking or simply to give visitors a smiling welcome. For much of the past year Hangzhou has been a construction site, eliciting more scowls than smiles. Work crews have paved new roads, renovated hotels and completed a gleaming expo complex where the meetings will be held. With days to go, polluting factories around Hangzhou have already been ordered to halt production. Just as Beijing’s smog cleared up when it hosted APEC, another major economic forum, in 2014, so the skies over Hangzhou have turned unusually pristine in recent days. Officials are sensitive to complaints about the cost of all this. One persistent rumour is that the city is spending 160 billion yuan ($24 billion) on the G20. If true, this would be remarkable, eclipsing Rio’s $5 billion expenditure on the Olympics. But Hangzhou says it is a lie: its entire municipal budget this year is only 120 billion yuan. Moreover, the local government has been adamant that it is not building new facilities for the G20. It notes that it broke ground several years ago on its new conference centre and that other infrastructure investments were previously planned, even if the schedule for their completion was accelerated. Not all believe the official version. One man, identified only as Mr Guo, wrote an online post in July, titled “Hangzhou, I’m ashamed of you”. It criticised the government for wasting money and disrupting ordinary people’s lives. State media said Mr Guo deleted the post after it started to go viral, but the police detained him for ten days for “disrupting public order”. According to the government, only the tiniest minority would have agreed with him. An official poll found that 96.8% of Hangzhou residents were happy to host the G20. That is a level of support that few Olympic cities—Beijing in 2008 was a notable exception—have ever claimed.",3.5

650933,Online send-off - Live-streaming funerals,"TURN around in your seat at the crematorium in the Berkshire town of Thatcham and you will see a web-cam, fixed to a beam, following the proceedings. It enables anyone who could not make it to the service to follow from afar. The valley of the shadow of death is now being live-streamed. Demand is growing. The crematorium gets one live-streaming request a week. Obitus, the company that hooked up the system, currently has cameras in 25 locations, charging £2,500 ($3,245) to install and manage the technology. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Forty years ago, “virtually every funeral was the same,” says Paul Allcock, president of the national funeral directors’ society—from the cortege to the Church of England rites. Nothing like the outdoorsy family that inquired this week about using a camper van as a hearse—typical, says Mr Allcock, of a customer base that is less religious, more diverse, and keen to personalise their departure. Even so, plenty of funeral directors are resisting. A recent survey showed 61% had received requests about live-streaming but many, in what is a “conservative” profession, are wary of what they consider intrusive technology, complains James Crossland, Obitus’s founder. Around a fifth of Britain’s 281 crematoriums have webcams in place. Tech-savvy families ask funeral directors to point them to one that does. The changing geography of modern family life provides more users. The number of Brits living abroad has risen 27% since 1990, to 5m. Some of them cannot make it back for funerals. Migrants to Britain, whose numbers have risen 133% in the same period, to 8.5m, may need webcams, too. Although the elderly can expect to live longer, they are often less mobile and unable to travel when they do—a problem, notes one staff member at Thatcham, that also faces the black sheep of the family who end up behind bars. Fairweather friends may use the live-stream as a way not to have to show up in person. In other spheres, such as sports, televised matches attract fewer fans. Mr Allcock says it would be a shame if live-streaming grew too much: personal sympathies given over the cold cuts after a service offer relatives great solace, he says. Death is not a football game. It is much more important than that.",3.5
654312,Christmas market deaths in Germany - A lorry crashes in Berlin,"AT LEAST nine people died and at least 50 were injured when a lorry crashed into a Christmas market in central Berlin on December 19th. The truck ran into the market near the Kaiser Wilhelm memorial church on Breitscheidplatz in the city’s central district of Charlottenburg, according to German police. Police have not yet confirmed whether the incident was a deliberate attack or an accident. They have cordoned off the area and called on Berliners to “stay at home and do not spread rumours”. One suspect died in an ambulance on the way to hospital, possibly of injuries sustained in the crash. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Another suspect was arrested nearby in Tiergarten, approximately 20 minutes’ walk from the scene. He is being questioned. The owner of the lorry, a Polish hauler, says he had lost contact with his cousin, who had driven the truck, at around 4pm on Monday afternoon. He told a television station that he suspected that the lorry had been stolen. Witnesses said the vehicle ploughed into the crowds at speed, travelling around 65kph (40mph), suggesting deliberate intent. This makes the incident reminiscent of this summer’s terror attack in Nice, when Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, a Tunisian French resident, deliberately drove a 19 tonne cargo truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day on the Promenade des Anglais, killing 86 people and injuring more than 400. Foreign leaders have expressed their condolences. The German government’s spokesperson wrote of “terrible news” on Twitter: “We are grieving for the dead and hope that the injured can be saved.” He was echoed by Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany’s foreign minister. Neither commented on whether the crash was deliberate, instead calling on people to wait for the results of the investigation. However, Wolfgang Bosbach, a domestic security expert and an MP with Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats, told NTV, a broadcaster, that everything pointed to a deliberate attack: “It was carried out not just with the greatest brutality and disastrous consequences but also with a deliberate symbolism. A few days before Christmas, in the middle of the German capital, amid happy, peaceful people. The message is clear: no matter where, no matter how, we can get you at any time.” If the crash turns out to have been deliberate, it would be the first big terrorist attack to hit Germany in recent years. A suicide bombing at a music festival in Ansbach, southern Germany, in the summer killed only the attacker. A knife attack on a train near Würzburg a few days earlier had left five people injured; the attacker was shot by police. Both those attackers were refugees who had recently arrived in the country. As a result, the attacks in Ansbach and Würzburg soured the mood in the country towards Angela Merkel’s liberal refugee policy. Members of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) took to Twitter soon after to link the crash in Berlin to Germany’s generous refugee policy. Marcus Pretzell, the head of the North-Rhine Westphalian AfD, tweeted: “To the “let’s wait and see” faction: this is the result of “waiting and seeing”.” He also used the hashtag #LokalesEreignis (#localevent) to allude to the rape and murder of a medical student in Freiburg in October, which nationalists said was insufficiently covered by mainstream media when the suspect turned out to be an Afghan refugee. If the calamity of December 19th turns out to be an act of terrorism, Germany looks set to become a less welcoming place for refugees.",2.5

Cast your vote for who you think came out on top. //cdn.playbuzz.com/widget/feed.js  A disclaimer: Online reader polls like this one are not statistically representative of likely voters, and are not predictive of how the debate outcome will effect the election. They are a measure, however imprecise, of which candidates have the most energized online supporters, or most social media savvy fan base.

A CNN/ORC flash poll also found that 62 percent said the Democratic nominee won, compared to 27 percent who picked Trump.

662703,Beyonce Gives a Behind the Scenes Look at Her Formation Tour Costumes,"Frank Micelotta/Invision for Parkwood Entertainment Beyoncé is probably the biggest pop star in the world about whom we know the least. Not only does she rarely give interviews or attend red carpets, but she posts to social media even more infrequently (not the worst habit when all of your contemporaries are getting into feuds). And as her latest album proved, we may think we know all about Jay and Bey, but clearly, we don’t know a damn thing. So when Beyoncé gives you a rare, intimate look behind-the-scenes at the making of her one-of-a-kind tour wardrobe, you get in formation.  The video, posted to Beyoncé’s Facebook page on Monday, gives fans a look into the full process that went into the creation of the singer’s half a dozen costumes changes throughout the Formation show, interviewing many of the crew members who are responsible for making sure Bey and her backup dancers look #Flawless night after night. According to the singer’s costume designer Marni Senofonte, the vision for the show began with the Lemonade movie, incorporating those Antebellum sartorial references for a look Senofonte calls “Victorian streetwear.” Next, a call went out to designers who sketched looks they thought would fit that motif, with Beyoncé playing an integral part in their creation, going back and forth with designers including Balmain and Gucci about what she liked and didn’t like, customizing the looks until they were exactly what she envisioned. The video also revealed a number of surprising facts about exactly what it took to create every picture perfect piece. For example, those mega-wide brimmed hats? The milliner built them off of sombreros, driving all the way to Mexico to get the perfect template. And for those wondering how her troupe of dancers can move so easily in those complicated couture pieces, the seamstresses showed the cameras how they cut darts into the costume’s armpits so that all of Beyoncé’s girls could move unencumbered. And finally, in a truly genius move, all of the fishnets the dancers wear are dyed in crockpots because “the girls don’t all come in one color” and they wanted the tights to match their skin tones perfectly. Now, that’s a trick you can use whether you’re the Queen B or just one of her devoted supplicants. What do you think of Beyoncé’s Formation tour looks? Which is your favorite?

672212,India to auction fugitive billionaire's art collection,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian tax authorities are hoping for a windfall with the auction on Tuesday of rare oil paintings that were once part of fugitive billionaire jeweler Nirav Modi’s collection and have been seized by the government. Auctioneers say the sale is the first of its kind in a country where tax authorities have usually auctioned property, gold and luxury items, but not art. After a court order allowing the auction to take place, tax authorities, who are pursuing Modi over the country’s largest bank fraud, appointed professional auction house Saffronart. The sale in Mumbai of some 68 works is expected to fetch anywhere between 300 million and 500 million rupees ($4.4 million-$7.3 million). “Until a few years ago, the tax authorities really didn’t know the value of art,” said Farah Siddiqui, an art adviser who is advising clients eyeing Modi’s collection. The 48-year-old Modi, whose diamonds have sparkled on Hollywood stars, is one of the prime accused in a $2 billion loan fraud at state-run Punjab National Bank. Modi denies the charges and believes they are politically motivated. The auction comes just weeks before a national election and as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces pressure to bring back Nirav Modi (no relation), who fled the country last year and has been residing in the United Kingdom. He was arrested last week by British authorities and remanded in custody after he appeared before a London court. India asked Britain last August to extradite Modi. The auction includes works by Raja Ravi Varma, a 19th century painter considered among India’s finest, and V.S. Gaitonde, a modern artist known for his abstract and often monochromatic paintings. “We believe that the collection’s intrinsic value will garner a positive response from collectors,” said Saffronart Chief Executive Dinesh Vazirani. India Law Alliance, a law firm representing the company controlled by Modi that owns the artwork, said it was challenging the court order that allowed the auction. The case will be heard by the Bombay High Court on Wednesday, a lawyer at the firm told Reuters. Vijay Aggarwal, a lawyer for Modi, declined to comment.

674452,Tension is mounting in Madagascar ahead of elections in November - Night of the long names,"THE placard is grim: a hand smeared in blood set inside a red circle, with the words: “Enough, no more killings; Rajao, get out.” Since police shot and killed two people on April 21st at an opposition rally in Antananarivo, Madagascar’s capital, there has been a steady stream of anti-government demonstrations. The trouble started with a new law that would have prevented leading opposition candidates from contesting elections scheduled for November. Among those barred were two former presidents: Marc Ravalomanana, who was ousted in a coup in 2009; and Andry Rajoelina, who had mounted the coup with the help of the army and ruled Africa’s biggest island until democracy was restored in 2013. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Even the constitutional court’s ruling on May 3rd that struck out parts of the electoral law, including those that would have prevented Mr Ravalomanana and Mr Rajoelina from running, has failed to placate the opposition. It is demanding the resignation of Hery Rajaonarimampianina, the current president, who has made as little progress in curbing rampant corruption as his two predecessors. He, in turn, says the protesters are attempting a coup. Western and African diplomats are scrambling to calm things down. Elections, they concede, are no longer certain to happen this year. The deadlock is one that Madagascar can ill afford. It is one of the few countries in the world that became poorer (when measured by income per person) between 1960 and 2010. And the crisis is frustratingly familiar. Madagascar has suffered several coups and bouts of violent instability. This time, at least, the army is standing aside. A statement signed by the heads of the army and police, and read out by the defence minister, called on party leaders to resolve their differences. That is easier said than done. The opposition has flatly refused to negotiate through foreign mediators, especially those from the Southern African Development Community, a regional club of 15 countries. It has dispatched Joachim Chissano, a former president of Mozambique, to mediate. But many Malagasy see him as the architect of the reviled “ni ni” (“neither nor”) deal under which Mr Ravalomanana and Mr Rajoelina were barred from standing for election in 2013, clearing the way for Mr Rajaonarimampianina. To break the cycle, the country badly needs free—and freely contested—elections.",4.0
677654,"Nigerian parliament opens inquiry into long-disputed Shell, Eni oil field","ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria’s lower house opened an investigation on Tuesday into an offshore oil field owned by Royal Dutch Shell and Eni, the latest inquiry into their acquisition of the OPL 245 license block which could hold up to 9.23 billion barrels of oil, according to industry figures. Earlier this year the Dutch and Italian authorities launched their own investigations. The acquisition in 2011 was a “breach of due process that resulted in monumental revenue loss to the country,” said Yakubu Dogara, speaker of Nigeria’s House of Representatives. A spokesman for Shell said: “As this matter is the subject of current investigations, it would be inappropriate for us to comment.” The license was initially awarded in 1998 by former Nigerian oil minister Dan Etete to Malabu Oil and Gas, a company in which he was a shareholder. It was then sold for $1.3 billion in 2011 to Eni and Shell. According to documents from a British court, Malabu received $1.09 billion from the sale, while the rest went to the Nigerian government. In 2014 a Milan court placed Eni under investigation over the purchase and the probe was later widened to Shell.

678572,Jon Kyl is John McCain’s successor in the Senate - Kavanaugh’s sherpa,"WHEN Senator John McCain of Arizona died last month, Doug Ducey, the state’s governor, faced a difficult choice. Who would he appoint to replace Mr McCain? And would that replacement be a placeholder who would keep the seat warm until the next special election in 2020, or would it be someone who could hold the seat for the Republican Party? Two days after Mr McCain’s burial, the governor opted for the former, though his selection doesn’t seem interested in holding the place for long. On September 4th, Mr Ducey announced his appointment of Jon Kyl, who represented Arizona in the Senate for 18 years, all of them as his state’s junior senator. When he decided to not seek a fourth term in 2012, Mr Kyl, who became a close friend of Mr McCain, intended his departure from the Senate to be permanent. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Under Arizona law, the appointee can serve until 2020, when a special election will be held to fill the remaining two years of Mr McCain’s term. Though Mr Ducey said he hoped to convince him to stay for longer, Mr Kyl said he wants to ensure that the Senate’s current business is taken care of, and that he doesn’t want to make any commitments beyond the end of the second session of the 115th Congress. The current business includes the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee to replace Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. In July, the White House tapped Mr Kyl to serve as a “sherpa” who would guide Mr Kavanaugh through the confirmation process. With just 51 Republicans in the Senate, Mr Kyl’s vote could be pivotal for the confirmation. In a press conference, the governor repeatedly said he chose Mr Kyl because he was the best person for the job. But he made no secret of the fact that he viewed Mr Kavanaugh’s confirmation as paramount among the new senator’s duties. In an earlier announcement on Twitter, the governor had included a hashtag, #KavanaughConfirmation. Mr Ducey is known as a cautious character. In selecting Mr Kyl, he has stayed true to form. The choice is unlikely to stir any controversy, an important factor for a Republican governor in the midst of what could be a tough re-election. With his choice of Mr Kyl Mr Ducey has managed to appease the various factions of the Republican Party. The appointment was almost universally praised by establishment Republicans, along with Mr McCain’s widow, Cindy, and daughter, Meghan, while also earning the approval of Mr Trump, who tweeted that Mr Kyl will be an “extraordinary senator.” Asked about his relationship with the president, Mr Kyl said he doesn’t really have one. “I’ve only met him on one occasion, several months ago. But it is my honour to be helping on the Kavanaugh nomination,” Mr Kyl said. In February, Mr Kyl told an Arizona radio station that Mr Trump’s style was “boorish” and that the president is his own worst enemy. This week Mr Kyl stood by those comments. He is unlikely, however, to mimic Mr McCain’s sharp, public rebukes of the president. Gibson McKay, who worked for Mr Kyl’s first Senate campaign in 1994 and for Mr McCain on several occasions, said the two have fundamentally different styles. “I think if Jon Kyl disagreed with the current president, he would let it be known. But probably in a softer, more delicate way than John McCain had done over the years,” he said. Mr Ducey joked that he received a lot of advice, mostly unsolicited, about whom he should appoint to Mr McCain’s seat. If he can’t convince Mr Kyl to finish the remainder of the term, the advice is likely to start pouring in again. Political observers spent a year trying to work out whom Mr Ducey would appoint; the rumours started up again as soon as Mr Kyl suggested his time in the Senate would be brief.",4.5
680572,Rick Ross Is Home Following 4-Day Hospitalization: Report,"Rick Ross is reportedly recovering at his Miami home after a health scare landed him in a Florida hospital last week. TMZ reports that the 42-year-old hip hop mogul was discharged early Monday morning following a 4-day hospitalization. The outlet says that Ross had been placed in an intensive care unit on Thursday and hooked up to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine (ECMO) — device which aids heart and lung functions. He is reportedly still receiving care at home. On Thursday Ross was found “unresponsive” in his Miami mansion. According to a Davie Police Department report obtained by PEOPLE and first published by The Blast, someone at the Miami mansion belonging to Ross, né William Roberts, called 911 at 3:34 a.m. for emergency medical support — saying a person matching Ross’ description was “breathing heavy” and “slobbing out the mouth.” When the male patient came to, he was “combative” with medical crews, which prompted officers to be called to the scene. A rep for Ross did not respond to PEOPLE’s multiple requests for comment. TMZ reported that the patient was transported to the hospital via ambulance and received respiratory treatment. A family member “strongly denied” the report of the hospitalization to the website, however. Ross has had a history of seizures, suffering two within six hours of each other in 2011 (his private jet was required to make an emergency landing each time). In the wake of the health scares, the musician reevaluated his lifestyle of weighing 350 lbs., sleeping for just three hours a night, and pounding back 24-oz. steaks at 4 a.m. As he told Men’s Health in its September 2016 issue, he changed his diet and incorporated exercise into his days — losing 75 lbs. “I’m happy,” Ross said. “I’m still losing weight, and now I’m starting to build hard muscle in places.”",3.5
683905,What is the flap about chlorinated chicken? - The Economist explains,"AMERICA has confirmed that it would be prepared to start negotiations next year on a post-Brexit trade deal with Britain. No deal can be signed at once. For that, Britain will have to leave the EU customs union, and this cannot happen before 2021. But that does not stop the two countries from laying the groundwork for a future deal. America’s trade envoy, Robert Lighthizer, has called for an ambitious agreement. Agreeing to a deal will be important politically, to show that post-Brexit hopes for a “global Britain” are more than bluster. Yet many Britons already worry about what this may mean. They fear that a Britain adrift from the EU will be in a weak negotiating position and obliged to make nasty compromises. These include opening up the NHS to foreign competition, and cutting consumer and environmental regulations. A particular bone of contention concerns chlorinated chicken. In America, after birds are slaughtered, their carcasses are washed with chemicals to manage pathogens such as salmonella and E. coli—a process known as “pathogen reduction treatment” (PRT). American exports of PRT-treated chicken have been rejected by the EU since 1997, and the issue remains a sore spot. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. As part of any trade deal between America and Britain it seems highly likely that Britain will be required to accept PRT-treated birds. The EU argues that antimicrobial treatments compensate for poor hygiene in parts of the production process. It also says that rinses are used as an easy fix to try to clean up unclean meat. America says this attitude is unscientific and actually a form of protectionism, designed to shield poultry producers in the EU from imports of cheaper American chickens. It is also the case that American regulators, who have approved a number of different kinds of antimicrobial rinse for use in poultry processing, have deemed PRT safe, and that European scientists do not seem to think there is much to worry about. Americans eat about 150m chickens each week that have been treated with PRTs, and they have come to little harm. Britons worried about these birds should consider that small amounts of disinfection byproducts are already ingested. According to the pro-trade Adam Smith Institute, chlorinated poultry would make up 0.3% to 1% of the disinfection byproducts consumed in the typical daily diet. (Drinking water makes up 99%.) American chickens would also be far cheaper, which would greatly benefit consumers. Moreover, nobody would be obliged to buy chlorinated chickens. “Organic” American chicken is not dressed in PRTs. All in all, chlorinated chicken is a paltry concern compared to what else will be on the negotiating table.",4.5
687186,Kylie Jenner Sells Hidden Hills House for $6.7 Million,"Kylie Jenner is downsizing her real estate empire, after buying four properties totaling more than $27 million in the last two years. The cosmetics mogul has sold one of her Hidden Hills homes in an off-market deal for $6.7 million, according to Variety. She also recently found a buyer for the empty lot next door that she listed in August, earning $5.35 of the $5.55 million asking price. Jenner, 21, purchased the home for just over $6 million in May 2016, the outlet reports. According to the listing from when Jenner bought the house, it’s about 7,000 square feet and includes six bedrooms and seven baths. Outside, there’s a fully outfitted entertaining area and kitchen as well as a pool. The social media star frequently shared photos inside the home on her accounts, and detailed some unique amenities, including a wine cellar tucked under the stairs, a room decked out specifically for the use of her beloved dogs, Norman and Bambi, and what she calls the “Boys’ Room.” A photo shared to her snapchat of the space showcases an array of issues of Playboy magazine next to a glass ashtray. WATCH THIS: Which Kardashian-Jenner Has the Highest Net Worth? Jenner had big plans for the empty lot next door. According to TMZ, she originally planned to build a garden and a barn for horses on the land, but she’s since had a change of heart. The house sits on 4.5 acres in the Hidden Hills neighborhood, where several other members of her family have homes, including the her sister Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s $60 million mansion, which West controversially shared photos of on Twitter, and her mom Kris Jenner’s second home that she purchased for $10 million in 2017. Jenner’s primary residence these days is the $12 million house in Hidden Hills she shares with boyfriend Travis Scott and baby Stormi, 7 months. She picked up that property in October 2016, according to Trulia. Until recently, her impressive real estate portfolio also included another house right next door to the $6.7 million place that she reportedly purchased for $4.5 million in August 2016 with the intention of making it the headquarters of Kylie cosmetics. It was back on the market just a few months later, listed in December 2016 for $5.4 million, according to Trulia. She bought her first home in nearby Calabasas, at just 17 years old, for a reported $2.7 million.",4.0
689304,A new initiative aims to modernise global trading rules - E-commerce,"“SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!” promises the seller of “The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organisation” (WTO). The magic of e-commerce means that the doorstopper can be exported from America to Tajikistan for a cool $35.95 (plus shipping). A new initiative on digital trade at the WTO strives to add to the laws and policies described within its pages. But far from increasing general satisfaction, this plan is controversial. At first glance, it is hard to see why. On January 25th representatives of 76 WTO members gathered at the annual shindig in Davos announced plans to negotiate new rules covering “trade-related aspects of electronic commerce”. Compared with the trade talks between America and China that restarted this week in Washington, this venture seems positively collegial. It makes sense: trade rules were written when cloud computing was the stuff of science fiction. What better way to demonstrate the value of the WTO, just as President Donald Trump is busy undermining it? Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. But a closer look reveals conflict. Though the 76 members account for 90% of global trade, they are a minority of WTO members. Many developing countries claim that tighter e-commerce rules would tie national regulators’ hands and that the issue is a distraction from others they care about more, such as limiting rich countries’ agricultural subsidies. The plan is to sidestep such complaints, which have blocked agreement at the WTO for years. Instead of getting all members to sign up to a multilateral deal, a like-minded group will set rules among themselves. Hold-outs, like India and South Africa, will not be able to block progress if their demands are not met. The cost is the legitimacy that a broader group would generate—and the fact that non-signatories will free-ride on any deal, gaining from others’ commitments, without having to make any themselves. Further battles lie ahead. “Countries don’t have a shared definition of what they’re negotiating,” complains Susan Aaronson of George Washington University. The WTO defines e-commerce as the “production, distribution, marketing, sale or delivery of goods and services by electronic means.” That is broad. An agreement could include regulations covering spam emails or rules helping digital purchases zip through customs. It could reach deep into members’ domestic regulations to cover cybersecurity or the protection of personal data. It could prevent barriers to cross-border data flows, or ban requirements to store citizens’ data on local servers. Every two years WTO members renew a promise not to tax digitally provided goods, such as films from Netflix. A new deal could make that permanent. American negotiators would like all of the above. Their technology firms benefit from data flowing freely, which helps them train algorithms and generate sales. Data-localisation is expensive, and could weaken security by giving hackers more targets. And, obviously, they would rather their digital sales were not taxed. This powerful lobby group’s ambitions have already been enshrined in deals away from the WTO. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which America’s Congress is supposed to ratify later this year, bans customs duties on digital products. So does the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was negotiated by 12 countries, including America, and revived by the others when Mr Trump pulled America out. The TPP bars governments from forcing companies to hand over their source code, and the USMCA goes further by including algorithms, too. Both ban data-localisation requirements. Many worry that American technology companies are using trade rules to neuter national regulators. In theory, there are exceptions to the rules regarding data localisation and technology transfer. But critics fear that governments will be wary of invoking those exceptions, and that arbiters at the WTO will side with companies. It will be hard to get European negotiators on board with some of this. European law treats privacy as a fundamental human right, and the free flow of data as secondary; the Americans (and Japanese) start from the premise that data should flow and only then consider exceptions on privacy grounds. Still, a recent deal between the European Union and Japan suggests the differences may not be insurmountable. The biggest fight will be with China. Its government views data as an issue of sovereignty, and trade in data as a national-security matter. Chinese representatives reportedly tried to narrow the scope of the talks, threatening not to participate. They joined in the end, presumably deciding that it would be better to have influence over any new rules rather than see standards that could become global set without them. Other countries see little value in rules that enshrine China’s draconian approach to data, but also know the value of having a country of China’s size involved. American administrations have tried to resolve these differences in the past. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a proposed deal between America and the EU, was supposed to cover the two sides’ differing approaches to data. Together with the TPP, it was meant to draw China into a less hostile regulatory pattern. Americans are once again working with other countries to pull in China. In December Roberto Azevêdo, the WTO’s head, described American efforts on e-commerce as “very active”. But negotiators may be short of bargaining power. Plurilateral negotiations on narrow topics at least mean that China cannot block all discussion. But they also remove the opportunities to bargain unrelated concessions against each other, which is how trade negotiators reach consensus. This initiative could be the success the beleaguered WTO desperately needs. Or it could be another demonstration of its weakness.",3.0
695818,More political paralysis will not serve Spain well - Heading nowhere?,"WHEN HE FAILED in February to get his budget passed, Spain’s Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, had little choice but to call a snap election. His government, just eight months old, had surprised many by lasting as long as it did. With only 24% of the seats in parliament, but without coalition allies, its every move had been a tricky negotiation. As the country heads to the polls on April 28th, the signs are that the political paralysis which now grips Spain may only worsen. The Socialists look set to win the most seats, but the new parliament will contain five big parties, thanks to the arrival of the ultra-nationalist Vox (see article). None will have anything like a majority, so the options will be another short-lived minority government, an argumentative coalition or, most likely, fresh elections—the fourth in as many years. The pattern is becoming familiar in Europe, where fed-up voters have abandoned the traditional parties of right and left (ask France’s Republicans, or Italy’s Democrats) and opted for a plethora of new groups, some on either extreme of the spectrum, others harder to pin down. Political fragmentation has caused protracted delays to the formation of governments in Germany, Italy, Sweden and Estonia in the past year or so. Finland this week looked likely to go the same way after its own inconclusive election. And when governments are eventually formed they tend to be weak, lowest-common-denominator affairs, further enhancing the popular distrust of established politicians; or else chaotic unions like the mixture in Italy of nationalist right and maverick left. France has been an exception, but even President Emmanuel Macron’s ratings have fallen sharply. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. It might be tempting to say that political paralysis is not a death knell. Mariano Rajoy, who lost a confidence vote at the hands of Mr Sánchez last June, managed his own minority government pretty well after losing his majority at the end of 2015. Although growth has now slowed to an expected 2.1% this year, it was above 3% in 2015, 2016 and 2017 as Spain smartly recovered from the disruption of the euro-zone crisis, trimming both its budget deficit and its high unemployment rate at the same time. But that recovery was part cyclical and part the delayed result of painful reforms that Mr Rajoy enacted before his People’s Party (PP) lost its majority. Spain faces a number of knotty problems that a weak government will not be able to solve. To sustain growth, it needs plenty more reform: to its schools system, its pensions, its complicated political structure and the labour market, building on Mr Rajoy’s useful work. One danger is that a new Socialist-led government may opt to rely on the left-wing Podemos party, which would frustrate some of this agenda and risk blowing up the budget again. The next government must also deal with the crisis in Catalonia, whose regional government declared independence after an unconstitutional referendum in 2017. Mr Rajoy, backed by Mr Sánchez, responded with direct rule. The Catalan government has now been restored, but nine of its former leaders are in jail and being tried on charges likely to result in long sentences. That will shatter an uneasy calm. Catalonia also bedevils the formation of any new government. The Socialists favour dialogue, but their other potential partner, Ciudadanos, is intractably against it—sadly, since in other ways it would act as a useful pro-market influence on Mr Sánchez. The alternative, a right-of-centre coalition between the PP and Ciudadanos, is a worrying prospect of a different kind. It would offer the Catalan separatists only further confrontation, and would almost certainly need to bring Vox into government in order to create a majority. For a country that has struggled so hard against the ghosts of Franco’s nationalism, that would be a step in the wrong direction. Ideally, Spaniards would vote on April 28th for Mr Sánchez’s party in large enough numbers for it not to need allies. But that looks highly unlikely.",3.0
699790,"Leah Still Beats Cancer, Designs Own Flower Girl Dress for Her Dad's Wedding","If Leah Still’s flower girl dress ends up looking a lot  like a pink version of Elsa’s gown from Disney’s Frozen, don’t be surprised.   It’s her favorite movie, Elsa is her favorite character and well, she just loves pink.   “I want my dress to look like this,” the spunky five-year-old told PEOPLE as she held up a sketch at a recent consultation with designer Hayley Paige at her New York City headquarters.   [IMAGE “5” “” “std” ]”Lots and lots of glitter!” she giggles, then adds with a shrug. “I’m a glitter girl.”   Not only is her father, Devon Still, getting his dream wedding, Leah is getting to design her dream flower girl dress with Paige.   Her father couldn’t be happier.   “I knew pink was going to be involved,” he says with a smile. “She loves princess stuff.”   It’s hard to tell that the spunky, self-described “girly-girl” sitting in a boutique Manhattan bridal shop designing her own tiny, sparkling hot-pink flower girl frock was battling life-threatening stage 4 neuroblastoma cancer just weeks ago – but doting dad Devon Still says that’s just his daughter’s personality, resilient and consistently positive.   “She’s just had the best attitude of fight and then move forward with life,” Devon, 26, tells PEOPLE of his daughter. “And look where we are now. I’m getting married to my love and Leah gets to be a part of this wedding. We overcame tragedy and are becoming a family. It’s like a fairy tale.”   Nearly two years ago, the recently signed Houston Texans defensive tackle and his  fianc  Asha Joyce put their wedding plans on hold after Leah was diagnosed with the deadly disease. Doctors gave her a 50-50 chance of survival.   Her diagnosis made headlines across the world in September 2014 after the Cincinnati Bengals cut Devon from their roster but offered him a position on the practice squad so he could keep his health insurance to help pay for Leah’s cancer treatments.    Devon publically documented his daughter’s two-year battle on social media, and officially announced that she “beat cancer,” in January.   The couple, who will be married in spring 2016, was selected by TheKnot.com, as the recipients of this year’s Dream Wedding.    The site is helping Devon and Joyce put on their special day – including coordinating with Leah to make her a custom-designed flower girl dress.  The site is also helping the couple carry out another dream – raising money for other families facing pediatric cancers – by setting up a charity registry for those in need.   Starting March 16, America is invited to vote on each detail of the day – from Joyce’s dress to the flowers and the honeymoon.   Leah’s dress, however, is not up for discussion. Everyone wanted to make sure Leah got exactly what she wanted for the big day.   “I’m excited for the wedding,” Leah says while coloring in dress sketches with a blush-tinted crayon. “I’ve never been to one!”   It’s clear she truly is Daddy’s little girl.    “I love you dad,” she whispers as she colors.   Devon says it brought him great joy to see his daughter working with Paige to create the dress, reminding him that every moment he sees his daughter happy is “precious.”     “When you sit back and look at everything and hover above, it’s important to remember to cherish every moment you have with your child,” he says. “My daughter was almost taken away from me, and I’ve learned that you can’t waste time.   “I only get 24 hours in a day to spend with Leah and my goal is to see her smile as much as I can,” he says. “We hang out and have fun and are silly.”   The daddy-daughter duo, who plan to “wing it” for their dance but have a special (surprise!) duet performance planned, have learned the importance of relying on family and love during difficult times.   “We aren’t quite at our happy ending right now, but we are getting there, and this journey has brought us so much closer,” says Devon of Leah. “We’ve been through so much in the past two years and things are finally starting to turn around. Hopefully people see that you can go from the lowest of lows and with strength and the right attitude can reach a beautiful high.”   To follow Devon, Asha and Leah’s journey to their dream day, be sure to follow the hashtag #theknotdreamwedding and to donate to the Still Strong Foundation, The V Foundation for Cancer Research, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital or the Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, through their charity registry, powered by Crowdrise.",3.5
704020,Greenhouse-gas emissions are increasing the frequency of heatwaves - Extreme weather,"EXTREME HEAT is ruinous to productivity, particularly if you are a criminal. Several American police forces posted messages to their social-media accounts last weekend declaring a moratorium on crime. “It is just too hot to be outside committing crimes,” wrote the Park Forest Police Department in Illinois, on its Facebook page. In some cases, it seems to have worked. “We have had zero customers stay the night at our ‘hotel’, so we appreciate all of the criminals adhering to the heat advisory,” tweeted the Malden Police in Massachusetts on Sunday. The messages came as scorching temperatures swept across America, placing more than 100m people under excessive-heat warnings. Temperatures hovered either side of 40°C on the east coast. On July 18th Mitch Petrus, a well-known retired player of American football, died of heatstroke after working outdoors all day. At least five other deaths have been reported. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. Europeans have also been sweating, for the second time this summer. A month ago, warm air from the Sahara contributed to making it the continent’s hottest June on record. At the top of Mont Blanc, western Europe’s highest mountain, instruments recorded 7°C (the normal June temperature would be below freezing). At Gallargues-le-Montueux near Nîmes, in France, temperatures peaked at 45.9°C. The previous record anywhere in that country was 1.8°C lower. Linked to these temperatures, in Alaska (see article) and Portugal (pictured), forest fires are raging. If your hunch is that this kind of extreme weather is more common today than it was once-upon-a-time, you are correct. When, in 2003, tens of thousands of people in Europe died prematurely as a result of a two-week heatwave, it was deemed to be a once-in-1,000-years event. Twelve years later, a study led by Nikolaos Christidis of the Hadley Centre, the climate-research division of Britain’s Met Office, found that heatwaves of this severity had become once-in-100-years events, and would be commonplace by the 2040s. The question on many people’s minds is whether these changes, and specific events like this week’s temperatures in America and Europe, are caused by greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere. For years, the semi-official line was that no single weather event could be blamed on climate change, only trends. That began to change in 2004, with the publication of the first “attribution” study. This focused on the European heatwave of 2003, when average summer temperatures broke through a threshold until then unbreached in 150 years of records. By comparing simulations of a world with and without greenhouse-gas emissions, Peter Stott at the Met Office and his colleagues found that climate change had made the record-breaking heatwave at least twice as likely as it would otherwise have been. Since then, research of this sort, intended to study how climate change is already promoting extreme weather, has grown rapidly. A recent, extended drought in California has been linked to greenhouse-gas emissions, as was the extreme heat southern Europe experienced during the summer of 2017. That event was made at least ten times more likely by climate change according to work published later that year by World Weather Attribution, a collaboration between experts in these sorts of analyses. Attribution work does not concern itself only with heat. Floods, storms and cold spells also carry a climatic fingerprint. When Hurricane Harvey hit America in August 2017, it stalled over Texas, delivering huge quantities of rain, which caused heavy flooding and more than 80 deaths. On that occasion, World Weather Attribution found that climate change was responsible for intensifying precipitation levels by between 8% and 19%. Since 2012, the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society has published an annual compendium of attribution studies. Roughly 70% of events scrutinised show some influence from climate change. One challenge has been to do the analyses faster. Findings connected with the heatwave of 2003 took a year to appear, by which time public interest had mostly moved on. The goal today is to offer a verdict on the influence of climate change on particular meteorological events more or less as they are happening. Here, the Met Office has been leading the way, with its Dutch, French and German counterparts close behind. But many other places do not have the capacity to carry out the onerous computer-modelling required. As a result, a European Union project planned to start before November will seek to provide contemporaneous weather-attribution analyses for the continent. An inadvertent early test of how this could work took place last month, when many of Europe’s attribution scientists gathered at a statistical-climatology meeting in Toulouse, just as the June heatwave hit. Within days they published their conclusions. Accumulating greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had made the event at least five times more likely than would otherwise have been the case. Such statements help show that the danger posed by climate change is clear and present, not just something for future generations to worry about. Heatwaves, for example, sometimes kill by the thousand—and can cause more casualties than other meteorological extremes, such as floods and hurricanes. But attribution also provides useful guidance to policymakers. For instance, information about how much more likely an event is today than it was 50 or 100 years ago can assist decisions about building and adapting infrastructure. If what were thought of as once-in-a-millennium heatwaves now come once a century and will soon become so frequent as to be normal, then public-health systems need to be designed to cope with an influx of people suffering from heat stress. Likewise, if big floods are more frequent, water-handling systems need to be expanded and flood defences raised. Insurance and reinsurance companies are paying particular attention, because these calculations help them reassess risk levels. Conversely, some people blamed climate change for a drought in south-eastern Brazil in 2014 and 2015, in which water levels in reservoirs around São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro fell to between 3% and 5% of capacity. But a study published in 2015 by Friederike Otto of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University found no sign that greenhouse-gas emissions had raised the risk of drought. Dr Otto concluded instead that a quadrupling of São Paulo’s population since 1960 had put pressure on scarce water supplies. Attribution science is also playing a role in courtrooms and human-rights hearings. A study published in 2015 showed that climate change contributed to the high wind speeds of supertyphoon Haiyan, which blew through the Philippines in 2013, killing more than 6,000 people. Those stronger winds created a much bigger storm surge. The matter was raised during hearings held by the Philippine Commission on Human Rights last year, which sought to explore the question of whether fossil-fuel companies could be held responsible. Others have sought to pin companies down more specifically. In one widely reported lawsuit, Saúl Luciano Lliuya, a Peruvian farmer, is suing RWE, a German energy firm, for contributing to the melting of a mountain glacier that threatens to sweep away his village. Mr Luciano Lliuya’s counsel, Roda Verheyen, has said that the case “was mostly made possible by the advancement of...attribution science”. Lindene Patton, a lawyer with the Earth and Water Law Group, a firm specialising in environmental law, has written that “the science of event attribution may become a driver of litigation, as it shifts understanding of what weather is expected and, relevantly for law, foreseeable.” To a layman, however good attribution science has become, trying to use it to link an event in the Peruvian Andes to a particular firm in Germany looks a bit of a stretch. But whether or not Mr Luciano Lliuya wins his case, the fact it is even being heard is a straw in the wind—and a sign that global warming can change metaphorical weather patterns as well as real ones. ■",4.5

But there's a catch: The researchers successfully focused light with this lens, which they call a ""metalens,"" but on an extremely small, nanoparticle scale (nanoparticles can be thousands of times thinner than a human hair). While an impressive feat, major tech companies like Apple and Samsung aren't anywhere close to putting this technology into forthcoming phones and cameras. This laboratory research was published on Monday in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, and might one day allow cameras, phones, and VR headsets to incorporate larger lenses that take up less space. This could allow for devices to exploit this added room for other purposes — like hardware and batteries — or add larger lenses without requiring a larger, heavier device. Some forms of visible light have long wavelengths (red) and other much shorter (blue). So to capture all these colors at once, cameras today use curved lenses to focus all the incoming light simultaneously to capture an image. This precise process has served us well for over a century, but these lenses inherently take up more space. “Metalenses have advantages over traditional lenses,” Harvard physicist Federico Capasso, the study's senior author, said in a statement. “Metalenses are thin, easy to fabricate, and cost-effective. This breakthrough extends those advantages across the whole visible range of light. This is the next big step.”  An artist's conception of incoming light being focused to a single point by a metalens. These minuscule metalenses contain even smaller ""nanofins,"" structures that control the speed of the different types of light as they enter the essentially flat lens.  In a statement, Harvard said they ""licensed"" this lens innovation ""to a startup for commercial development."" And back in their Harvard lab the researchers plan to do more work, scaling up their nanoparticle lens to something exponentially larger at one centimeter in diameter. For now, this metalens may only exist in a microscopic world, but the researchers envision bigger things in the years ahead — though how long remains uncertain. ""This brings us one step closer to the goal of incorporating them into common optical devices such as cameras,” said study co-author Alexander Zhu. ",2.0

709173,Woman Talks Being a Stay-at-Home Mom in Powerful Essay,"Kayla Roussin says she never thought her simple Facebook post about being a stay-at-home mom would garner so much attention — and prompt stories from mothers everywhere. Roussin, a 27-year-old mother of three, wrote candidly about married life in the lengthy post. It encouraged stay-at-home mothers, who are “scolded” by their husbands if the house isn’t clean when they return from work, to stand up for themselves. “When my husband and I decided I should be a stay at home mom, we agreed that that’s what I would be, a MOM. I am not a stay at home housekeeper,” the Michigan mom began the message, which she posted alongside a photo of her husband doing the dishes. “We as mothers do not give up careers, adult interaction, a paycheck, and sanity to ensure that the house shines like the top of the Chrysler building when our husbands walk through the door.” She explained that her husband, 29-year-old Jonathan Roussin, usually helps her clean when he returns from work. She advised other husbands to do the same, writing, “Instead of talking down to your wife for the crumbs on the floor, pick up a broom.” Roussin’s post quickly amassed hundreds of shares and “likes,” and has even appeared in several popular motherhood blogs alongside her personal blog In The Midst of Mama. She tells PEOPLE that she felt compelled to highlight what many stay-at-home mothers deal with on a daily basis. “You just see so many moms complain about the fact that their husbands get upset that the house isn’t clean when they get home from work, or dinner is not on the table. It makes me so sad that so many people have to deal with that,” Roussin tells PEOPLE. “I am on the go all day, and my kids are my first priority. So cleaning the house is not on the top of my to-do list.” She adds: “I feel like so many moms these days are so consumed with cleaning the house so their husbands aren’t upset that they end up missing out on their kids being young. And that makes me so sad.” Since the post has made its way around the Internet, Roussin has received both praise and criticism, she says. “There were comments from people saying that I was lazy and that is not the case. There were a couple of men who commented on it and said, ‘Well, I’m glad my wife doesn’t think like this.’ It just made me sad,” she tells PEOPLE. “I’m speaking to the women that feel obligated to keep their houses spotless. Not because they want to, but because they need to because of their husband’s expectation.” Still, she says, she’s heard from women who were inspired and encouraged by the candid post, noting that the public’s response to her address has been mostly positive. “My intention was to let moms know that open communication between you and your spouse is so important. I was hoping to reach men and women,” she says. “I was hoping that women would realize it’s okay to leave the mess there. I’m not saying to make your house a dump … but being a stay-at-home mom means so much more than keeping your house clean. It means being there for your kids.”",4.0
717050,Toni Braxton and Birdman Appear to End Engagement,"It looks like Toni Braxton and Birdman won’t be walking down the aisle anytime soon. The music stars appear to have called off their engagement, scrubbing their Instagrams clean save for a New Year’s Day post Braxton uploaded where she spoke about new beginnings. “Starting a new chapter isn’t always an easy choice… but ALWAYS choose to be chosen,” the 51-year-old “Un-Break My Heart” singer wrote, captioning a photo of herself in a red ballgown. “Cheers to a new year.” Reps for both stars did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment, but according to E!, Birdman, 49, had written “It’s over” on his Instagram Story before clearing all his posts. Both have also unfollowed one another on the popular social media platform. Braxton and Birdman announced their engagement back in February, launching the singer to begin planning what she called a “vintage ’20s and ’30s-like Great Gatsby themed wedding.” As of November, all seemed to be nearly in place, with Braxton telling PEOPLE Now that Birdman was pushing to tie the knot before 2019. “He told me we’re getting married before the end of the year is up,” she explained. “He’s talking about crazy things. Like, ‘Let’s just go to Vegas.’ And I want the dress!” All in all, Braxton said then there was a 70 percent chance she’ll be a Mrs. before the new year. “To him, it’d be 100, like now,” she said. With a friendship dating back “15 or 16 years,” the pair’s relationship began when he rushed to be by her side in the midst of her battle with lupus. “In 2016, I was doing a little tour, just testing the market [to see] how far my endurance could go – and I got ill just before we went out,” Braxton previously told PEOPLE in April. “Every day I had a show, he came. Every night he would ask me, ‘Are you okay? Are you good?’ I said, ‘Oh my God, he’s such a great guy!’” When Birdman finally made his move, “He told me he always liked me and I was like, ‘You never told me!’ And he’s like, ‘Well, you were married!’ He said, ‘I was always digging you.’” Rumors began to swirl after the couple were spotted getting cozy at the 2016 BET Awards. The former couple first teased their engagement in February during a trailer of her family’s hit WeTV reality show Braxton Family Values, where she excitedly told her sisters, “I have an announcement to make — I’m engaged!” while flashing her canary yellow diamond ring that Birdman designed. Braxton, who’s up for two Grammys at February’s awards show, was previously married to singer/songwriter Keri Lewis, with whom she has two sons. The 12-year marriage ended in 2013.",3.0
726512,Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's Cars Reportedly Burglarized,"Three cars parked on Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West‘s property were reportedly burglarized in the early hours of Friday morning. According to TMZ, who obtained a surveillance system image from the scene, the alleged perpetrator ransacked three vehicles at the end of their driveway in Los Angeles. The outlet reports that the suspect also targeted a car parked in the couple’s neighbor Kathy Griffin‘s driveway, allegedly stealing a purse that was later discarded nearby. A Los Angeles Police Department spokesperson confirms to PEOPLE that a motor vehicle theft occurred on the block of Kardashian West and West’s home at around 5:10 a.m. “A woman observed a suspect enter and exit a vehicle, taking some of the contents,” said the spokesperson, adding that the investigation is ongoing. According to the spokesperson, there are total of two suspects, though no descriptions of either were provided. TMZ reports that the suspect never entered the home but trashed the cars and made away with an iPhone belonging to one of the couple’s staffers. A security guard reportedly spotted the suspect and chased them away. “Nothing of Kim or Kanye’s was taken. Their security handled it. The guy didn’t even make it past the driveway. He was startled by their security, and dropped the phone he was trying to take,” a source told E! News.   The reported burglary comes just over a year after 36-year-old Kardashian West’s terrifying Paris heist: On Oct. 3, 2016, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star was robbed at gunpoint at the No Address Hotel during Paris Fashion Week, when masked men stole millions of dollars worth of jewelry from her in the middle of the night — including a $4 million ring. The reality star has since reflected on how her harrowing experience turned her into a “different person.” “It was probably no secret, you see it on the show — me being flashy — but I was definitely materialistic before,” she told Ellen DeGeneres in April. “Not that there’s anything bad about having things and working hard to get those things — and I’m really proud of everyone that’s around me that’s successful. But I’m so happy that my kids get this me. And that this is who is raising my kids. Because I just don’t care about that stuff anymore, I really don’t.” “I know this sounds crazy, but I know that was meant to happen to me,” she continued. “I don’t want to start crying, but … I’m such a different person. I really feel like things happen in your life to teach you things.” But on a recent episode of KUWTK, Kardashian West was clearly still reeling from the trauma, crying as she worried about the security of family friend Joe Francis’ estate on Mexico while on vacation. “Ever since Paris, I just go through this worst-case-scenario mode in my head,” she said. “I was so excited to come on this trip, and I had no idea that I was going to end up feeling this way, but it hit me right as we were getting off the plane that all these people at the airport are going to see 17 or 18 girls with all of our Chanel bags and Louis Vuitton [things], and it just hit me.” “We are the biggest target ever,” she added.",4.0

733649,Tom Cruise's Craziest Stunts – and the Toll They Took on His Body,"Tom Cruise is notorious for pushing the limits with his stunt work, often performing high-flying action sequences by himself. Just last month, he injured his ankle while filming a scene for Mission: Impossible 6 in London, where he had to jump between two buildings. Below is a collection of the craziest stunts the 55-year-old has performed over his long career, along with the toll they’ve taken on his body – and his coworkers’ anxiety levels. 1. Hanging Off the Side of a Flying Plane in Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation Described by Cruise himself as “undoubtedly the most dangerous thing I’ve ever done,” the incredible plane stunt that kicks off the opening sequence of the fifth Mission Impossible film has become one of his most iconic onscreen moments. The stunt was so outlandish that, according to director Christopher McQuarrie, the idea for it originated with a joke. “While searching for different locations, the production designer James Bissell bought me a model of this Airbus airplane and presented it as something we could use in the movie,” he told Yahoo UK. “I suggested to Tom, ‘What if you were on the outside of this thing when it took off?’ I meant it as sort of a half joke, but he said back to me, ‘Yeah I could do that!’ “ Despite the obvious dangers of hanging off the side of a plane as it takes off, Cruise said he was mostly concerned about making sure his body was situated correctly for the cameras. He did open up about one close call, however, telling reporters, “I remember one time we were going down the runway and there was just a little particle that just hit me, it was smaller than a finger nail. I was thankful it didn’t hit my hands or face, if it did I’d have a problem because those parts were exposed, but it still could have broken my ribs!” Speaking about the stunt, he admitted to PEOPLE at the film’s premiere in 2015, “It was intense. I’m not going to lie.” 2. Holding His Breath for 6.5 Minutes in Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation After conquering the sky during the film’s dramatic opening, Cruise later made audiences squirm as he went under water, learning to hold his breath for 6.5 minutes for one scene. In the scene, Cruise’s character, Ethan Hunt, needs to break into an underwater storage facility – and of course, there’s no room for an oxygen tank. To make the sequence seem as realistic as possible, Cruise and his costar Rebecca Ferguson trained with professionals to learn how to hold their breath for long periods of time. But Cruise took things a step further: “Normally in underwater sequences, people hold their breath for 10 seconds, 15 seconds max,” a nonchalant Cruise explained on the film’s DVD extras. “So I had to prove to everyone that it was actually safe, and spend time with the safety guys and the safety officers to show them, look, not only is it safe, it’s better that I know how to hold my breath because I’m going to be very relaxed. No one’s going to have to rush in, no one’s going to have to panic.” Watch Cruise explain the stunt further to a very nervous Graham Norton on The Graham Norton Show above. He also goes over some unintended side effects of the training – like forgetting to breathe normally when back on land. 3. Scaling the World’s Tallest Building in Mission Impossible – Ghost Protocol Cruise once again went to great heights to entertain his audience when he dangled off Dubai’s Burj Khalifa – the world’s tallest building at 2,722 feet – for a scene in the series’ fourth installment. “I think I probably aged 10 years,” the film’s stunt coordinator, Gregg Smrz, later told NY Daily News of the scene, which required the film’s star to hang 1,700 feet in the air with a wire as thick as a piano cable for support. Besides the obvious problem of gravity, Cruise faced extreme winds and temperatures as the desert sun baked against the building’s reflective glass surface. And, as the clip above from The National shows, Cruise was doing a whole lot more than just hanging out up there. “One night, after one of the earliest shooting days, I bolted up in bed realizing that we had our star dangling about a mile up in the air on a thin wire and my brain was screaming, ‘What the hell are we doing,’” director Brad Bird told the NY Daily News. “The whole thing was one, extended, hair-raising moment but we planned well.” Asked what went through his head when he first stepped outside of the building, Cruise later told reporters, “I hope I don’t fall.” 4. Swordplay on Mechanical Horseback in The Last Samurai Cruise trained for eight months to prepare for the swordplay and martial arts scenes in The Last Samurai – but a small technical failure almost cost him his life. “One day we were shooting, I was on a mechanical horse and Hiro (Sanada) was on one too,” Cruise told reporters, according to Yahoo. “He was approaching me and then suddenly his horse hit me and his sword was right here,” he added, pointing about an inch from his neck. “Luckily Hiro is trained in martial arts. I trust him.” Even without the technical problems, The Last Samurai’s action sequences were intense enough to push a veteran like Cruise to the edge. Speaking about another intense moment in the film, Cruise reportedly said, “We shot the scene from the first swing all the way through to the end. There were over 70 points of contact where you could potentially lose your eye, your ear or your nose.” 5. Riding with the Bulls on a Motorcycle – with Cameron Diaz on the Back Sometimes Cruise’s enthusiasm for stunt work can be contagious, like on his 2010 film Knight and Day with Cameron Diaz. During one of the film’s most memorable sequences, the duo ride together on a motorcycle while being chased by a team of bad guys. As they’re driving away from a hail of bullet fire, Diaz’s character flips around on the motorcycle to face their assailants and fires off some shots of her own. The idea for Diaz’s stunt, Cruise later told Access Hollywood, was all his – and to her credit, the actress agreed to perform it without a double. But when it came time for another stunt – in which the two ride side-by-side with a pack of bulls – Cruise admitted he got a little nervous. “I always thought I wanted to run with the bulls until I was on a motorcycle doing it, running and getting ping-ponged into walls with big bulls in front of us,” Cruise said, according to Yahoo. “I was just thinking to myself, ‘Do not go down on this motorcycle with Cameron [Diaz] on the back.’”",3.5
734057,"Apple, McDonald's, Google and IKEA to face EU lawmakers over tax deals","BRUSSELS - Apple (AAPL.O), Google (GOOGL.O), McDonald’s (MCD.N) and IKEA[IKEA.UL] will be asked about their European tax deals on Wednesday as EU lawmakers ratchet up the pressure on multinationals to pay more tax on their profits locally. The hearing, organized by the European Parliament’s tax committee, follows a similar event in November last year when Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), HSBC (HSBA.L), Google and eight other companies were quizzed on the same subject. While the committee has no power to order changes, the hearing reflects the political concerns over multinationals avoiding local tax liabilities. The European Commission is also investigating several cases to see if they breach the bloc’s state aid rules which prohibit EU countries from giving some companies an unfair advantage by making special deals on tax. Starbucks (SBUX.O) declined to take part because it has challenged a European Commission order to the Dutch authorities to recover up to 30 million euros in back taxes, the European Parliament said in a statement. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCHA.MI), which is also appealing against an EU finding against its tax deal with Luxembourg, also turned down the invitation. The head of Inter IKEA Group, Soren Hansen, will argue the Swedish furniture retailer’s case. Inter IKEA Group owns the intellectual property rights under which its retailers operate. The Parliament’s Green party last month accused IKEA of avoided paying some 1 billion euros in taxes from 2009 to 2014 because it channeled royalty income through a Dutch company and possibly through Luxembourg and Liechtenstein. All the companies have previously said they comply with EU tax rules. Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Greg Mahlich",2.5
742366,UPDATE 1-Brazil's JBS shuts 7 plants after $230 mln asset freeze,"(New throughout, adds comments from ranchers and consultancy) SAO PAULO, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Brazilian meatpacker JBS SA shut down seven slaughterhouses in Mato Grosso do Sul after a court-ordered asset freeze affected its operations in Brazil’s second largest cattle-producing state, a press representative said on Wednesday. The world’s largest meatpacking company said in an emailed statement that the plants would stay closed until the matter is resolved. The asset freeze, which affects JBS SA and the group’s holding company J&F Investimentos, is related to an investigation into alleged tax irregularities. According to JBS financial statements, the case revolves around tax benefits given to the company by the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. Shares of JBS fell as much as 3.6 percent during the day following news of the plant closures, but bounced back to 8.15 reais, a 1.45 percent drop from Tuesday’s close. The company, whose owners face corruption and insider trading charges, said a combined 730 million reais ($230.64 million) had been frozen by a lower court in the state. JBS said it was working to restore operations and maintain 15,000 direct and 60,000 indirect jobs in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. It will continue paying employees normally, the statement said. Laucidio Coelho Neto, president of cattle ranchers association Acrissul, said there would be oversupply in the state as other meatpackers there are not big enough to purchase the available animal stock. Still, he did not expect the shutdown to affect beef flows to export markets, explaining Brazil was a large supplier and production can be redirected, including by JBS, to plants in other states. Brothers Wesley and Joesley Batista, owners of JBS, were arrested last month in connection with insider trading and other offenses related to their plea deal. Wesley, the elder of the brothers and also JBS’s former chief executive, quit his position and has been replaced by his father José Batista Sobrinho. With the plant closures, the price of the arroba (15 kg) fell to around 130 reais, 4 percent lower from the levels earlier in the week, said Lygia Pimentel, a director at consultancy Agrifatto. $1 = 3.1556 reais

743003,Scientists built a robot fish to spy on hard-to-find ocean animals,"Capturing marine life up close is tricky, but this robot could be a novel solution. Researchers from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory have developed a soft, robot fish called SoFi, which can swim on its own and is lifelike in its movements as to not disturb other sea animals. Made of silicon rubber and flexible plastic, SoFi can swim, handle currents, snap photos and videos at depths of more than 50 feet (15 metres) for up to 40 minutes at a time.  These results are based on test dives conducted in Fiji's Rainbow Reef, and were documented in the journal Science Robotics. A diver controls the fish from a waterproofed Super Nintendo-like controller, allowing it to move in a straight line, turn, or dive up or down. The diver can also control SoFi's speed, and allow it to make specific moves or turns.  Unlike other autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), SoFi isn't tethered to a boat or powered by a bulky propellor.  It's powered by a lithium polymer battery, the same that can be found in consumer smartphones. To swim, SoFi makes a side-to-side motion with the help of a motor that pushes water into two balloon-like chambers, making the fish bend and flex. ""We are excited about the possibility of being able to use a system like this to get closer to marine life than humans can get on their own,"" the paper's lead author Robert Katzschmann said in a statement.  SoFi is slated for further improvements, with Katzschmann's team looking to increase speed by  improving its pump system and modifying the design of its body and tail.

It’s a showdown!”   The new dad says he’s thankful both he and Murgatroyd, 30, feel like things are taken care of at home so that they can pursue this other important aspect of their lives. “We have amazing help and we always wanted to see if Peta would be okay to come back because the timing is so short,” he explains. “It was so important for us to recognize this opportunity for her to get back to this, what she loves to do and how she wants to do it.” “So I try to accommodate as much as possible domestically, and now she’s accommodated.” While the couple have help, they’re on their own when Uncle Val is over and it’s diaper-duty time. “I haven’t changed diapers yet. I just don’t want to expose him,” jokes Val. “We’re going to be friends one day, and I don’t want him to look back and be mad at me because I saw him in such a vulnerable scenario.” Season 24 0f Dancing with the Stars premieres March 20 at 8 p.m ET on ABC.",3.5
746108,New documentary unpacks 'The Problem With Apu'," It's 2017, and some things just won't stand anymore. Hollywood's twisted norms are being ripped apart, from habitually silenced sexual misconduct to blatant whitewashing and irresponsible racial representation. The last of that delightful trifecta is the subject of The Problem With Apu, a new truTV documentary about how The Simpsons' breakout caricature became the bane of an entire racial diaspora's existence. The Problem With Apu started out as comedian Hari Kondabolu's personal vendetta against the fictional title character. Apu Nahasapeemapetilon is a recurring guest character on The Simpsons. He speaks in a thick, fabricated Indian accent, exaggerated for comedic effect by voice actor Hank Azaria.  Apu is so transcendentally offensive that a U.S. Surgeon General had to answer to impressions of the guy. ""[You're] probably thinking: 'Come on, snowflake, let it go!'"" Kondabolu says in the trailer. ""Well I have let it go – for 28 years."" In the documentary, he's joined by a veritable who's who of South Asian actors now prominent in American film and television: Kal Penn, Aasif Mandvi, Aziz Ansari, Hasan Minhaj, Maulik Pancholy, Utkarsh Ambudkar, Sakina Jaffrey, Aparna Nancherla – the list goes on. Seeing them all together illustrates the ubiquity of this stereotypical representation – which was, after all, the alternative to no representation at all. The film also includes interviews with former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, and it's in that moment, early on, that the absurdity kicks in. Apu is a character so salient yet so transcendentally offensive that a U.S. Surgeon General had to answer to impressions of the guy. Apu is, perversely, the one thing unifying South Asian American actors of a certain generation without fail. A visceral reaction to anything that resembled Azaria's impression may be the reason so many South Asian American actors hesitate or outright refuse to do accents in their work.   Much of the documentary – which runs about an hour in length – is devoted to tracking down Azaria for comment. It asks a lot of him that he doesn't answer for; Azaria was ostensibly an actor in need of a role, but video clips and interview snippets inform us that he never considered the lasting, damaging effects of his Apu interpretation, and neither did producers on The Simpsons. ""There are accents that...to white Americans, sound funny, period,"" Simpsons writer and co-executive producer Dana Gould explains in the film (tip: This is not an explanation). An entire generation of actors and first-generation Indian Americans at large have had to double down and erase their heritage to escape the burden of this character and what he represents.  The documentary also reveals the shocking origin of Apu's name – not the last name, which is pure nonsense, but the first name, inspired by Satyajit Ray's revered Apu film trilogy. The films – about a young man growing up in modernizing India – won awards at Cannes, the Venice Film Festival, the New York Film Festival, the British Film Institute Awards, and many more, and Simpsons creator Matt Groenig distilled that into a shady convenience store owner. Without the show or Azaria accepting any culpability, The Problem With Apu leaves things open-ended. The Simpsons remains a seminal comedy in the history of American television, and Apu is part of that no matter what we do. It's up to audiences to accept the complexity of this character, of his accidental but undeniable legacy and the strides representation has taken since then – and still needs to take in the future. The Problem With Apu premieres Nov. 19 at 10 p.m. on truTV. ",3.0
748829,Tatyana McFadden Parents and Upbringing in Orphanage,"This September, when wheelchair racing sensation Tatyana McFadden competed in an unprecedented seven track and field events at the Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, the two most important people in her life were there cheering her on as she attempted to make history. “I’ve got two moms,” Tatyana, 26, told PEOPLE several days before winning the 2016 Boston Marathon for her fourth straight year. “And they’re my role models for everything in my life from my work ethic to being humble.” Tatyana’s against-all-odds story sounds like something ripped from a Hollywood movie script. Born in St. Petersburg, Russia, with spina bifida that left her paralyzed below the waist, doctors doubted she’d live more than a few days and her parents soon turned her over to a local orphanage. But over the next six years the plucky tyke refused to give up. “It really was a miracle I survived,” recalled Tatyana, who never received any medical care and learned to “walk on my hands or scoot myself across the floor” because there were no wheelchairs at what was known as Orphanage No. 13. “I just wanted to be like the other kids, to go wherever they were going and never saw myself as any different than they were.”  One morning when she was 6, Deborah McFadden, a George H.W. Bush-appointed commissioner for disabilities in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services toured the bleak facility and spotted the “bright-eyed, engaging” little girl crawling around on the floor. Back at her hotel room that evening, Deborah recalls that she “couldn’t get her off my mind.” Tatyana felt the same way. “After she left, I ran around telling the other kids, even the director, ‘That’s my mom. She’s going to be my mom,’ ” she remembered. “I just knew it. But no one believed me. We all knew that people who came to the orphanage were only interested in the younger, healthier children.” Not Deborah. “I still can’t explain the connection we had, but there was no question in my mind that she was supposed to be my child,” recalled Deborah, who soon adopted Tatyana. Before long, Tatyana – who’d been “neglected for so many years” that Deborah was told she wasn’t expected live much longer – was on a plane flying back to her home in Clarksville, Maryland, that Deborah shared with partner Bridget O’Shaughnessy. “She calls me, ‘mom’ and Bridget ‘momma,’ ” said Deborah, who later adopted two more daughters from Albania. Besides getting her the medical care she desperately needed, the two women did everything they could to get the sickly little girl healthy. They immediately bought her a wheelchair and soon got her involved in a range of sports, including basketball, sled hockey, swimming, gymnastics and track. Before long, Tatyana had become fixated on wheelchair racing. She’d spend hours after school and on weekends, strengthening her muscles and honing her racing skills on the track or out on the road. “There were nights I’d be out on the track late and Bridget would be there with me and we’d have little headlamps on our heads,” Tatyana recalled. “On weekends she’d ride her bike beside me while I’d be in my racing chair. I’m so blessed and fortunate that both my moms have been so supportive in everything I did.” Over time, the once frail little girl was transformed into a seasoned athlete whose upper body rippled with muscles. At 15, Tatyana became the youngest member of the U.S. Paralympic track team and traveled to the games in Athens where she won silver in the 100 meters and bronze in the 200. Tatyana won another eight medals in track events at the Paralympics in Bejing and London. At the 2013 World Championships, she became the first athlete to ever win six gold medals at a single competition. That same year, Tatyana, whose sister Hannah, 20, is also a Paralympic wheelchair racer, became the first person to ever win all four of the world’s major marathons in London, Boston, Chicago and New York. Deborah, whose relationship with Bridget is still going strong after 32 years, still can’t believe how life has turned out for Tatyana. “She was meant to be here,” she said. “And Bridget and I are just sort of along for the ride.” To learn more about Tatyana, visit teamusa.org.",3.0
753222,"Trump Says Puerto Rico Relief Efforts Stymied by 'Big Water, Ocean Water'","President Trump has been criticized for what some are calling his lackluster response to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico — and his explanation on Friday did little to help him. During a speech on his tax plan in Washington, D.C., Trump said the Hurricane Maria disaster relief effort in Puerto Rico has been complicated because the island is “surrounded by water.” “This is an island, surrounded by water. Big water. Ocean water,” the president said.

Lauderdale News, Weather, DecoThe Cerda-Garza family has been through a lot.    Five years ago, Julissa Cerda brought her infant daughter Delilah to the Miami Transplant Institute for a rare multi-organ transplant. This year, she and her husband Jose Garza had to repeat the process with their son, 1-year-old son Liam.   Both of the Cerda-Garza’s children were diagnosed with Berdon syndrome, a rare disease that affects one in about one in a million children. It affects the muscles of the bladders and bowels and makes it impossible for children to hold down food. Most babies born with it don’t live longer than a year without treatment.    “It didn’t make it any easier to have to do it twice,” Cerda told the Miami Herald. “As a parent, it’s very hard,” she said. “But I stay strong for both of them. They’re the ones going through it. I’m just the support system.”   Liam underwent Florida’s first-ever eight-organ transplant, receiving a new liver, stomach, large and small intestine, pancreas, kidneys and bladder. The nine-hour surgery wasn’t a sure thing: “The doctors didn’t guarantee us he was going to make it because he was so ill,” Cerda said. (Delilah, now 6 years old, received seven new organs in 2011.)   Liam, who turned 1 on Feb. 17, hasn’t left a hospital since his birth and has lived his entire life being fed intravenously through his chest. Now, several weeks after the surgery, he’s begun to eat solid foods, including carrots, peas and bananas.    Hopefully, Liam will be coming home in about four weeks. But both he and his sister face a lifetime of anti-rejection medicine and regular hospital visits. But their odds are looking good, pediatric gastroentereologist Jennifer Garcia, who cares for the pair, told the Herald.   “Outcomes from intestinal transplant have really improved over the last 20 years,” Garcia said. “The one-year survival is about 90 percent for pediatrics. The five-year survival rate is about 70 to 80 percent. And once you get past five years, it plateaus and stays at 70 to 80 percent.”",3.5
753809,Santander to pay $25.9 million to resolve subprime auto loan probes,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc (SC.N) has agreed to pay $25.9 million to resolve investigations by the attorneys general in Massachusetts and Delaware into its financing and securitization of sub-prime auto loans. The settlements were announced on Wednesday and resolved allegations Santander facilitated unfair, high-rate auto loans for thousands of car buyers. The loans were then packaged into securities sold to investors. The accords mark the first settlements in connection with U.S. investigations into subprime auto loan securitization, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said. The U.S. Justice Department has also been investigating the matter. Santander, which is the largest packager of subprime auto loan securities in the United States and an arm of Spanish bank Banco Santander SA that went public in 2014, in a statement said it was pleased to resolve the matter. “In the last 18 months, our new management team has taken significant steps to strengthen our business practices and controls,” Santander said. It stressed that the settlements, which focused on how auto loans were originated, were not about securitizations, but said any such claims were released under the accords. According to Healey, the investigation revealed that Santander funded auto loans without a reasonable basis to believe borrowers could afford them, predicting many would default. The probe also revealed that Santander knew certain dealerships had high default rates due of inaccurate data on loan applications but kept buying the loans from them anyway, authorities said. Santander even identified a group of dealers it called the “fraud dealers” whose loans it nonetheless continued to fund, Healey’s office said. She said the conduct repeated the pattern seen with banks in the run-up to the subprime mortgage meltdown that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. “These predatory practices are almost identical to what we saw in the mortgage industry,” she said. Healey’s office said the settlement was part of an ongoing industry-wide investigation into securitization practices in the subprime auto market. The settlement follows an earlier 2015 accord for $5.5 million between Healey’s office and Santander relating to its funding of loans that included expensive insurance coverage. Under Wednesday’s settlements, Santander will pay $22 million to resolve the Massachusetts case, which includes $16 million in relief to 2,000 consumers. The company will pay also $3.9 million to resolve the Delaware case, including $2.88 million into a trust for the benefit of Delaware consumers, Delaware Attorney General Matt Denn said.

At the school, Kate looked on as children drew, telling the budding artists, “I love what you are doing here,” before suggesting she take one of the coloring sheets “home to do with George and Charlotte.”    Harry, 33, meanwhile, was about 75 miles north west of London, to see the site of the Silverstone Experience, which is due to be installed at the historic race track.

He added, “The Silverstone Experience will be a fascinating and exhilarating visitor attraction, based here at the home of British Motor Racing. I am sure that it will help to engage children in engineering by making that all important connection between their text books and the excitement and thrills of motorsport.”  Harry also announced the experience would open in 2019, which he would return for.

770941,"Daisy Ridley Uses Turmeric to Zap Zit, Dyes Face Yellow","Source: Instagram Daisy Ridley loves a good DIY beauty treatment. In fact, the Star Wars actress isn’t afraid to let fans in on her at-home tips and tricks — even if they don’t always go according to plan. Case in point: After Googling “at-home remedies for skin,” the star fell upon a turmeric treatment to help remedy her pesky breakouts in a pinch. But, according to the star, she was “slightly liberal” with the yellow-tinted herb during the application process, and it unfortunately left her complexion more mustard-hued than sunkissed goddess. “ I scrubbed my face and I am YELLOW! Ahahahahaha,” she wrote on Instagram. “Will have to see if I’m a squeaky clean clear skinned goddess in the morning… #wishmeluck #forrealsfloraimsosorryifimstillyellowinthemorning #benmorrisyoutoo.” In the clip (above), Ridley joked that she had to go to set the next day (with her newly dyed yellow complexion) to continue filming the next Star Wars installment, not “Minions 2.” Ridley’s turmeric treatment isn’t the first time she’s aired her skincare woes on social media. Last month, the actress opened up about her nine-year battle with endometriosis, which, she admitted, wreaks havoc on her skin. “At 15 I was diagnosed with endometriosis. One laparoscopy, many consultations and 8 years down the line, pain was back (more mild this time!) and my skin was THE WORST,” she wrote. “I’ve tried everything: products, antibiotics, more products, more antibiotics) and all that did was left my body in a bit of a mess. Finally found out I have polycystic ovaries and that’s why it’s bad. I can safely say feeling so self conscious has left my confidence in tatters.” The star added that after a modifying her diet, seeing a specialist regular and finding the right treatments, she’s seen improvements in her skin.  “From your head to the tips of your toes we only have one body, let us all make sure ours our working in tip top condition, and take help if it’s needed,” she urged fans.

771706,Rami Malek Didn't Want Bond Villain Linked to Religion,"Rami Malek had a few important conditions in mind when he agreed to play the villain in the upcoming James Bond 25. The Oscar-winning actor seemed to know his character would be some sort of terrorist, but for Malek, who was born to Egyptian immigrant parents, it was imperative his evil ways were not linked to a certain religion or ideology. “It’s a great character and I’m very excited. But that was one thing I discussed with [director Cary Fukunaga],” Malek, 38, told the Daily Mirror. “I said, ‘We cannot identify him with any act of terrorism reflecting an ideology or a religion. That’s not something I would entertain, so if that is why I am your choice then you can count me out.” Luckily for Malek, Fukunaga had something entirely different in mind, allowing the actor to take the role with no qualms. “That was clearly not his vision. So he’s a very different kind of terrorist,” he said. “It’s another extremely clever script from the people who have figured out exactly what people want in those movies. But I feel a substantial weight on my shoulders. I mean, Bond is something that we all grow up with.” According to the film’s official plot summary, Malek’s character is “a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology.” The Bohemian Rhapsody star was born in Los Angeles to parents who had recently immigrated from Cairo, and has said his Egyptian heritage and culture make up “the fabric of who I am.” “There’s no first-generation or second-generation removed. I am Egyptian,” he told the Mirror. “I feel so gorgeously tied to the culture and the human beings that exist there. I am very proud of where my family and I come from.” Malek confirmed he’d be playing the villain in the as-yet-untitled 25th Bond movie in April with a video shared to the franchise’s official Twitter account.

775498,"Rupaul's Drag Race Finale: Sasha Velour on Her ""Alien Eve"" Look","The monsters’ reign is just beginning. Sasha Velour’s time on the RuPaul’s Drag Race throne ended when she crowned Aquaria in last night’s season 10 finale, but as her “Alien Eve” coronation look proves, she has a lot more to show the world. The season 9 winner sketched the design for her style director, Nancy The Girl, and designer Diego Montoya, whose “gorgeous embellishments” brought her vision to life. “I wanted to embody the fantasy of a more-than-human alien goddess, kind of queer Fantasia for a new world of imaginative queer performers that go beyond humanity,” Velour tells PEOPLE about her finale look. “So we came up with an alien idea, and then gave it an Eve, or maybe even Lilith, twist of someone who has experienced, and taken knowledge and really transformed it into self empowerment.” “I wanted to do something that had pants. I looked at all the previous returning queens and thought about the classic drag queen step down look and it’s always traditionally a gown,” she adds. Velour faced towering expectations for her return to the RPDR stage after the now-iconic “So Emotional” lip sync that helped her snatch the season 9 title, but the star says it’s her “own crazy demands” that really push her to innovate. “I always want to go to the next level with something, so it’s dangerous. Now my body is fully covered in crystals and stones, I’m a perfect alien goddess wrapped in a snake, holding a giant apple. I don’t know what could possibly be next. Probably minimalism,” she jokes. The ethereal look is fitting for a queen who spent the past year traveling around the globe and cultivating her inner strength. “Obviously my life has changed enormously,” Velour says of her demanding year. “The practical aspects of it are different and bigger, and Sasha has had to become a very powerful and smart and savvy person. I’m thankful that I had that character because the need for her to pretend to be that person has, I think, really made me that person. That is the magic of drag.” With her Brooklyn theater show, Nightgowns, a short film series called One Dollar Drags and the launch of her own drag magazine, Velour, the star has worked overtime to provide meaningful, enlightening entertainment since she took home the crown. “Everyone who passes through Drag Race, and especially the people who are able to have really big careers after the show, has a responsibility to the queer community to do a good job of representing queer people across the board to be kind and loving,” she said. “We are brought into the world to entertain people and to give, especially queer people, a sense that there is entertainment being created for us, with our standard of beauty and joy and truthfulness and gender-bending. I’ve really been trying to live up to that this year.” That responsibility has only gotten more intense as RPDR reaches broader — and increasingly fervent — audiences. “I think the move to VH1 has really had a huge impact for the community,” Velour says. “It’s definitely shifted and expanded the audience of the show, which allows our stories and experiences as queer people to get shared with folks who maybe wouldn’t have access to those stories.” “The audience of Drag Race and the fans of drag queens are often very surprising,” she adds. “The other day in the airport I meant a middle-aged married couple who recognized me out of drag and wanted to get a picture. It’s so beautiful that drag is able to speak to so many different types of people.” But, more eyes on the competition to become America’s next drag superstar means a greater potential for troublesome behavior within the community. During season 10 in particular, current and former contestants have grappled with the fandom’s upsetting treatment of queens of color. Bob The Drag Queen, RPDR‘s season 8 winner, drew attention to the problem on Twitter. “Sometimes Drag Race makes me realize other things about the world. NOT ALL, but a lot of the most popular queens fall into the thin white category. And NO black queens, except @RuPaul, have over a million followers. It’s not the show. It’s the fandom,” he wrote earlier this month. Sometimes Drag Race makes me realize other things about the world. NOT ALL, but a lot of the most popular queens fall into the thin white category. And NO black queens, except @RuPaul, have over a million followers. It's not the show. It's the fandom. pic.twitter.com/ngevUfrSfU — Bob The Drag Queen (@thatonequeen) June 15, 2018  Velour has prioritized using her own platforms and passionate fanbase to bring visibility to a diverse spectrum of performers, with the hope that change in the drag world will herald a larger cultural shift. “Racism is a problem everywhere, especially in this country, but all over the world, and especially within queer space,” she says. “I think that the best thing to do is to pivot to the amazing POC entertainers that are very visible out in the world and then many that people haven’t even given the time of day to, who are more than deserving. One of my goals is always to share any kind of spotlight I’m given. I love that my show Nightgowns is a place where people can come and get to know lots of different drag performers.” “And it’s no secret that drag does not exist without black drag performers, without trans drag performers, without immigrant drag performers, and seeing all of us together as a community, as we’re intended to be, feels very political at a time when that vision of beauty is not represented almost anywhere. And I hope that the drag community works harder — I have work to do myself — and I hope everyone joins in that process so that we can, by shifting the world of drag, slowly leave an impact in the world at large.” As she continues to extend her influence in the drag world and beyond, Velour says returning to the workroom for a possible All Stars season is one adventure she has no interest in pursuing: “I don’t think [I’d consider going back],” she says. “The drag that I’m immersed in now is not about competition. It’s about celebrating and uplifting the amazing people around you and being part of a conversation rather than like slowly eliminating other queens until you’re the only one standing. That just doesn’t appeal to me.”",3.5
777801,Hedge funds lighten bullish positions in oil: Kemp,"LONDON (Reuters) - (John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) Hedge funds started to reduce their record bullish position in crude and refined products in the week to Nov. 21 amid growing concerns about the possibility of a sharp price reversal. The net long position held by hedge funds and other money managers in the five main petroleum futures and options contracts covering crude and fuels were cut to 1,092 million barrels from a record 1,120 million on Nov. 14. For Brent, WTI, U.S. gasoline and U.S. heating oil, the net long declined by 28 million barrels after rising by 237 million barrels over the previous four weeks, data from regulators and exchanges shows. Most of the adjustments came from the long side of the market, where portfolio managers reduced the number of long positions in Brent, WTI and gasoline in a sign of profit-taking after a strong price rally. In total, fund managers cut petroleum long positions by 26 million barrels while raising short positions by only 2 million barrels (tmsnrt.rs/2ADBuzF). Despite the profit-taking, bullish positioning in all contracts remained close to record levels, which continued to leave the market vulnerable to a further correction. From a fundamentals perspective, the positioning appears reasonable, given strong growth in consumption and the likelihood that OPEC will extend production cuts for a further nine months to the end of 2018 when ministers meet in Vienna this week. But prices have already risen a long way in a short time and the hedge fund community has amassed a record number of positions that could make it hard to sustain buying momentum. The conflict between positioning (where risks are firmly tilted to the downside) and fundamentals (where risks are more balanced or even tilted to the upside) is a source of tension within the market. For the past two weeks that conflict has kept prices relatively steady after a fairly consistent and sustained increase since late June, but the uneasy stalemate may not last once the OPEC meeting concludes. Oil traders have largely priced in a full nine-month extension of the current production agreement between OPEC and its non-OPEC allies, and ministers have done little to temper expectations. Failure to extend the agreement for the full nine months could therefore spark a sharp correction, but pressing ahead will fuel concerns about the market tightening too much by the end of 2018.

His comment likely referenced his Twitter post earlier in the day calling the alleged shooter, Nikolas Cruz, a 19-year-old former student of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland where the attack occurred, “mentally disturbed.” Cruz, who was detained shortly after the shooting, currently is being held without bond. He has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder, and has not yet entered a plea. He previously had been expelled from the school for disciplinary reasons, authorities have said. The pain of losing her daughter also threaded through a Facebook post written by Lori Alhadeef, although she paid tribute to Alyssa’s spirit as a means to inspire others. “My daughter Alyssa was killed today by a horrific act of violence,” she wrote on Wednesday. “I just sent her to school and she was shot and killed.” • For more compelling True Crime coverage, follow our Crime magazine  on Flipboard “Alyssa was a talented soccer player, so smart, and amazing personality, incredible creative writer, and all she had to offer the world was love.

786857,Philippines says may not freeze all 20 mines facing suspension,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines said on Friday it may not halt operations at all 20 mines facing suspension for environmental violations and will give them time to address problems — a softening of a tough stance that has seen 10 mines shut and a spike in nickel prices. Asked if it was possible that not all 20 mines would be suspended, Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Regina Lopez told Reuters: “Yes, if they are able to fix whatever” needs to be fixed. “Some of the violations though will take time to fix. So they need to use their employees to fix it. They should put measures to make sure it doesn’t happen again. The welfare of the people is paramount,” said Lopez, a committed environmentalist. The Philippines, the world’s top supplier of nickel ore, on Tuesday ordered the suspension of another 20 mines, sending nickel to a seven-week high of $10,900 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange. The price has since retreated, pulling back further to $10,375 on Friday after Lopez’s comments. Lopez on Tuesday said that the 20 mines, 12 of them nickel producers, will be given seven days to explain any violations and submit measures to rectify them. Only 11 out of the Philippines’ 41 mines passed a two-month audit aimed at punishing those causing environmental harm. The 10 suspended nickel mines and those at risk of being halted account for nearly 60 percent of the Philippines’ nickel ore output. Lopez said some of the violations uncovered in the audit were minimal, while some involve the destruction of the environment and would take time to be addressed. Those with serious environmental lapses will still be suspended, she said. The Philippine accounts for nearly a quarter of the world’s mined nickel supply, most of which is shipped to China. Marcventures Mining and Development Corp, whose nickel mine was among the 20 facing suspension, said its audit findings “are defensible and can be reversed”. In a stock exchange filing, Marcventures said there appears to have been some “unintended oversight in the audit” citing matters that have yet to be acted upon by the environment agency, including approval of its mine rehabilitation plan. Lopez’s stance on mining is backed by President Rodrigo Duterte who had warned miners to strictly follow tighter environmental rules or be shut down, saying the nation could survive without a mining industry. Past environmental disasters, including a 1996 tailings leak at a copper mine in central Marinduque province that contaminated rivers, have spurred mining opponents in the Philippines led by the influential Catholic Church. Miners, however, have questioned the latest review, particularly the inclusion of anti-mining activists in the audit teams.

789922,Jayme Closs Suspect Applied for a Job the Day She Escaped,"Jake Patterson, the Wisconsin man suspected of kidnapping 13-year-old Jayme Closs and killing her parents, reportedly applied for a job the day Jayme escaped to freedom. Patterson, 21, was allegedly looking to land a night position with Saratoga Liquor Co. in Superior, Wisconsin, according to an online job application obtained by the Associated Press. Although the liquor company had no knowledge of his alleged crime at the time, they decided to not move forward with Patterson’s application — explaining he had little work experience, the Associated Press reported. In the skill section of his resume, Patterson described himself as “an honest and hardworking guy.” He then explained he didn’t have “much experience but I show up to work and am a quick learner.” For work experience, Patterson resume says he was a production worker from October 2016 to January 2017.   He also states he went to Marines boot camp from April 2017 to December 2017 before working as a laborer from April 2018 to November 2018. Patterson is being held in the Polk County Jail. He is charged with two counts of first-degree homicide, one count of kidnapping and one count of armed burglary, according to the complaint. The criminal complaint against Patterson alleges that he fatally shot Jayme’s parents on October 15, before binding the teen with tape and dragging her into this trunk. According to the complaint, which was obtained by PEOPLE, Patterson sometimes left Jayme under the bed for as long as 12 hours at a time — depriving her food, water or bathroom breaks. Around Christmas time, Patterson allegedly went away to visit his grandparents while the girl hid under the bed, afraid to move. “When he left the house, the defendant stated he would tell [Jayme] that she better not leave and told her bad things would happen if she tried,” the complaint alleges. “The defendant stated she knew she shouldn’t come out from under the bed when he was not there. The defendant stated that because of his anger outbursts [Jayme] complied and did as she was told.” The complaint also states that Patterson allegedly told detectives he “put quite a bit of thought into the details of how he was going to abduct” Jayme after first noticing her as she boarded her school bus one morning. The complaint alleges Patterson told police he assumed he “had gotten away” with his crimes two weeks after the killings. He allegedly said he only learned Jayme’s name when he got her back to his home some 70 miles away in Gordon, and found out the names of her parents from local news coverage of their murders. “The defendant states he never would have been caught if he would have planned everything perfectly,” the complaint alleges. At his court arraignment on Monday, Patterson was not asked to enter a plea and his bail was set at $5 million. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Click here to get breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases in the True Crime Newsletter.",3.0
790194,Wicked Tuna Star William Hathaway Dead at 36,"William “Willbilly” Hathaway, a featured cast member on Wicked Tuna: Outer Banks, died following a car crash over the weekend. He was 36. According to local reports, Hathaway was involved in a car accident in Salisbury, Maryland, on Saturday. Local news station WBOC 16 reports that Maryland State Police were notified after Hathaway’s truck swerved off a remote road and into a ditch. Hathaway, a native of Berlin, Maryland, allegedly called his wife after the accident to tell her that he had been cut off on the road but was okay. By the time paramedics arrived, however, Hathaway was allegedly unconscious and slumped over the center console. He was reportedly transported to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. There was minimal damage to his truck and the airbags did not deploy, according to WBOC 16. A police investigation into the crash is ongoing. National Geographic expressed condolences in a statement posted to the Wicked Tuna Facebook page on Tuesday. “National Geographic and Pilgrim Media Group were saddened to hear of the unexpected passing of our friend William Hathaway, a Wicked Tuna: Outer Banks cast member,” the statement reads. “Our sincerest condolences go out to William’s family and friends at this difficult time.” Following news of Hathaway’s death, members of the Ocean City fishing community set up a Facebook fundraising page to assist his wife, Mary, and newborn daughter, Molly. “He was an exceptional human being whose passion was the sea. He always brightened the day of anyone he met,” reads the page’s description. “His wife and new born baby girl he was most proud of. Due to his untimely death we are asking for donations to help them stay on their feet while trying to survive this tragedy.” As of Tuesday, over $69,000 out of the $250,000 goal has been raised.",3.5

Everybody should boycott the @megynkelly show. Never worth watching. Always a hit on Trump! She is sick, & the most overrated person on tv. — Donald J.

Really good night! Crazy @megynkelly is unwatchable. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 16, 2016 Fox's full statement, which was obtained by Mediaite, denounced Trump's attacks on Kelly as ""crude and sexist."" Donald Trump’s vitriolic attacks against Megyn Kelly and his extreme, sick obsession with her is beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate who wants to occupy the highest office in the land. Megyn is an exemplary journalist and one of the leading anchors in America — we’re extremely proud of her phenomenal work and continue to fully support her throughout every day of Trump’s endless barrage of crude and sexist verbal assaults. As the mother of three young children, with a successful law career and the second highest rated show in cable news, it’s especially deplorable for her to be repeatedly abused just for doing her job. Trump's discord with Kelly dates back to an August GOP debate, during which he was questioned by the anchor about sexist remarks he had made and later claimed Kelly had ""blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.""  Trump also boycotted a Fox News debate moderated by Kelly in January, claiming the journalist wouldn't treat him ""fairly"" and calling for her removal from the debate. Fox News refused, asserting that Kelly had been ""viciously attacked"" by Trump and stating the network would not ""Give in to terrorizations of any of our employees.""",4.5

793359,Tess Holliday Goes Shirtless at Toronto's Union Station to Support Body Diversity,"Protest on track 5! Tess Holliday and nine other women took a stand for body diversity at Union train station in Toronto, Canada, where they stripped down to their bras and jeans, holding signs encouraging people to take photos and share them on social media to start a conversation about body acceptance. “Today something amazing happened & I got to share it with these amazing women,” Holliday, 31, wrote on Instagram Wednesday. “Yes for body diversity. Yes to walking through Union Station in just your bra & jeans. Yes to us embracing our bodies at all stages.” One sign said, “Share this to break the stigma #IWontCompromise.” Another said, “Post this to fight for body diversity #IWontCompromise.” Holliday’s sign said, “Share this if you’re unapologetic #IWontCompromise.” The movement was organized by the curvy clothing brand Penningtons, which carries Holliday’s own line. The brand live-streamed the campaign on Facebook Wednesday night as the women walked through the station.   Holliday started the #effyourbeautystandards movement over two years ago to encourage people to change their body expectations, and it’s grown worldwide.   “Millions of women have joined me, letting me know that they now feel good about how they look and are free to wear what they like,” Holliday previously told PEOPLE. “They tell me how my being willing to be out there and tackle the unrealistic notions that our society has of beauty has changed their lives — sometimes has saved their lives.

795727,Las Vegas Shooting: Victim Jordan McIlldoon,"Heather Gooze went from laughing and posing for pictures with colleagues as she bartended at the Route 91 Harvest music festival to holding two dying men in her arms after a gunman perpetrated the deadliest mass shooting in United States history on Sunday night. “We were having a blast,” she tells PEOPLE. “But then all of a sudden there were people running through the bar and we couldn’t understand why.” She heard shots, but at the time she thought they were just part of the show. “Everyone was dancing and [Jason Aldean] kept on singing,” says Gooze, 43, of Las Vegas. “Then there were thousands of people running through trying to break the gate down behind my bar. They were literally climbing on top of each other.” Gooze’s bar was on the way out of the venue. But instead of running for safety, Gooze stayed to try to help as many people as possible. “We had so many injured people and they couldn’t get out,” says Gooze, who at the time thought the shooter was still on the premises — and not on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel. “I saw a lot of deceased people.” Fifty-eight people were killed in the mass shooting, with 527 injured. As she tended to those who had been shot, one man came up two her carrying someone who had life-threatening injuries. “He told me to come over and asked me to hold this guy’s jacket, put my hand on the back of his head and hold as much pressure on it as possible,” she says. “I could literally feel the bullet hole in the back of his head. There was blood everywhere.” As she held his shoulder and kept him close, she could feel him stop breathing. The pair got him into a car, but she thinks he had already died. Gooze only heard the man’s first name. Soon after, she spotted three men were carrying a young man on a ladder — something they used along with barricade gates and banners to help get the injured out. “I reached out and held his hand,” Gooze recounts, tearfully. No one knew his name or anything about him, so when his phone rang, Gooze and a stranger she was with picked up and learned his name was Jordan McIldoon, and that he was from British Columbia. “We asked him to help us find names and phone numbers for his family,” she says. “Jordan’s phone was locked but Facebook messages kept on coming up so I went on Facebook to try and find him.” While she was sending messages to everyone who had his last name, McIldoon’s mom called. The man she was with picked up and she told him that her son was there with his girlfriend, Amber. McIldoon died in Gooze’s arms as they tried to track down Amber to see if she was okay.  “She picked up but was in lockdown at the Tropicana [hotel],” Gooze says. Gooze then had to tell her her that McIldoon had died. “I said, ‘I don’t want to be the one to tell you this but he didn’t make it,’” she recounts. Amber’s response was heartbreaking: According to Gooze, she said, “No, that can’t be true.” She added, “He’s the love of my life.” Gooze then made her a promise: She wouldn’t leave McIlldoon’s side until Amber showed up to be with him. She also called McIldoon’s mother back, and made the same promise to her. “I wouldn’t leave him or go anywhere until I could make sure that they knew where he was and what was going on,” she recalls. “I’m not a brave or courageous person but something inside of me just wouldn’t let me leave the venue.” Gooze — who was with McIldoon for four hours — was determined to make sure that he wouldn’t be forgotten. “I didn’t want him to be a John Doe,” she says.",3.5
798141,Islamic State claims air base attack in Egypt's North Sinai,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Islamic State has claimed an attack on an Egyptian military airport that killed one officer and wounded two near the town of Arish in North Sinai on Tuesday, the group’s Amaq news agency said in a statement. Security sources meanwhile said an army officer and five militants had been killed in clashes as security forces carried out arrest raids near the Arish air base on Wednesday. The Amaq statement said Islamic State fighters used a Kornet anti-tank missile in the Tuesday attack that targeted the interior and defense ministers who were visiting the area. Neither minister was harmed, a security source said. Islamic State’s Sinai branch has for years waged attacks against security forces, and in the past year expanded targets to include Christians and other civilians. An attack on a mosque last month which killed more than 300 people, the deadliest in Egypt’s modern history, was widely attributed to Islamic State, but the group did not claim it. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ordered security forces to use heavy force to stamp out the Sinai insurgency within three months after that attack.

Luckily, Corden gathered what was left of his ego to face off against Kevin Hart – only for the comedian to show Corden who was boss.

803564,"Ariana Grande, Pete Davidson 'Tired of Being Attacked': Sources","After Pete Davidson wiped his Instagram account and Ariana Grande turned off her comments on Monday, fans were worried there was trouble in paradise. But sources close to the couple tell PEOPLE exclusively the engaged stars just needed a break from the negativity they’ve been receiving from fans since their whirlwind engagement. “They’re just tired of being attacked,” says a Grande insider. “They don’t get why there’s backlash when it’s supposed to be a really happy time for them. Pete especially has been getting a lot of hate from fans. It’s been hurtful, and he’s actually pretty sensitive.” Over the last few weeks, the entertainers have constantly been on the defensive — and it all reached a head earlier this week after Davidson, 24, was dragged by naysayers for commenting “omg what a cutie” on a photo of Grande and her late grandfather posted by his fiancée. “Are you guys all insane? i was talking about how cute her grandpa is. what’s wrong with that? you guys will really look for anything to attack people. it’s sad,” he wrote back to one fan. According to the insider, Grande, 25, also “doesn’t want drama,” and the couple — who got engaged last month after just weeks of dating — decided it was “easier to cut things off for now instead of being on the defensive all the time.” After stepping away from the social media platform, Davidson is “now in a good place,” adds a source close to the Saturday Night Live star. “He’s decided to focus on his relationship and how happy they are instead of on all of the haters and naysayers,” says the Davidson source. “They’re still very happy and looking forward to getting married.

805361,London unveils contactless payment system for buskers,"Fewer people are carrying cash these days, which doesn't bode so well for buskers who rely on spare change. London is rolling out a system which allows people to pay the city's street performers with contactless cards, in what is claimed to be a world first. Busk In London, an organisation representing street performers, has partnered on the project with London mayor Sadiq Khan and Swedish payments company iZettle, the latter of which was acquired by PayPal earlier this month.  ""Now, more Londoners will be able to show their support to the capital's brilliant, talented street performers,"" Khan said, according to the BBC. I'm delighted that Londoners will be able to show their support to the capital's talented street performers using contactless cards, as well as cash. We've partnered with iZettle through @BuskInLondon to launch this innovative, first of its kind scheme https://t.co/B9ye7jRwMN — Mayor of London (@MayorofLondon) May 27, 2018 The scheme launched on Sunday following a trial of the technology among a select group of buskers.

""More people than ever tap-to-donate whilst I sing, and often, when one person does, another follows,"" she added. Street performers will need a smartphone or a tablet, and will have to connect a card reader to it so they can receive payments. No details are available yet on whether it'll cost buskers to hire out these card readers, if there are any fees associated with use, and exactly how the donor or busker will set the donation amount — most likely within an app. When it comes to contactless payments, the UK hasn't been shy when it comes to adoption. For years, commuters have been able to use a contactless bank card to pay for train or bus rides, and more recently churchgoers have been able to do the same with donations. ",3.5

806218,Prince William's Birth Debut 1982,"On June 21, 1982, a future king was born. Princess Diana and Prince Charles welcomed Prince William at St. Mary’s Hospital in London 36 years ago today. “He has the good fortune not to look like me,” Charles said at the time of his first-born son. The now father of three was the first royal baby to be born in a hospital—a tradition he’s continued with his own kids with wife Kate Middleton. Kate gave birth to all three of their children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and newest addition Prince Louis, at St. Mary’s. Each baby got a royal debut in similar fashion to their father’s—including not revealing their names right away. Prince George and Princess Charlotte‘s names weren’t revealed until two days after their births, while Prince Louis‘ took four days. Charles and Diana delayed sharing William’s name for several days as well. A notable difference between William’s debut versus his kids is the wait time between when Kate made an appearance on St. Mary’s steps as opposed to when Diana did. Kate has become famously known for her quick post-birth exits. Following both the births of Prince Louis and Princess Charlotte, she was in and out of the hospital within 12 hours. (After Prince George was born, she spent one night in the hospital before heading home to Kensington Palace.) Diana wasn’t as into the same-day dash. After William’s birth, she spent the night, and introduced him to the public with Charles one day later. She did the same with his brother, Prince Harry. The royal dad has paid tribute to his late mother in many ways—from naming his children after her (Charlotte’s middle name is Diana) to continuing her humanitarian work. “William is keen to subtly keep [Diana’s] legend alive,”  Ken Wharfe, Diana’s ex-bodyguard, previously told PEOPLE. Since 2007, he has also served as president of the Royal Marsden Hospital Trust, a position his mother held from 1989 until her death. Just as she did in 1996, William observed a procedure during a November 2013 visit. “We’ve got more photos up ‘round the house now of her and we talk about her a bit and stuff,” William said last year in the documentary Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy. “It’s hard because obviously Catherine didn’t know her so she cannot really provide that…level of detail. So, I do regularly (when) putting George or Charlotte to bed, talk about her and just try to remind them that there were two grandmothers in their lives,” he continued. “It’s important that they know who she was and that she existed.”",3.5

Want all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs? Click here to get those and more in the PEOPLE Parents newsletter. While her WWD shoot is her first cover all by herself, it’s hardly North’s first foray into the editorial sphere. In August 2017, the little girl accompanied Kardashian West, 38, on a journey to the past for Interview magazine‘s September cover story, wearing looks seemingly ripped from vintage photographs of late former First Lady Jackie Kennedy and her family in the accompanying photo series. Kardashian West’s callback to Kennedy’s iconic chic style was obvious, from her bouffant hairstyle to her strands of white pearls. North wore matching white gloves, a black Bonpoint dress and sweet frilly socks in some of the photos (in many of which she was captured snoozing on her reality-star mom). Almost a year later, North appeared alongside the KKW Beauty mogul and grandmother Kris Jenner to front Fendi’s #MeandMyPeekaboo campaign in honor of the 10th anniversary launch of the brand’s iconic Peekaboo bag, posing in candid and spontaneous shots taken in Los Angeles that captured the intimate, personal side of their family. North stomped the catwalk for the first time two months later, in September 2018, appearing as Thrilla during the L.O.L. Surprise Fashion Show in Pacific Palisades, California. To the delight of the crowd, including Kardashian West, North walked the runway wearing a Michael Jackson-inspired look consisting of a red jacket with a matching skirt alongside a black zip-up top, white socks and black shoes.

828908,Britain's Mike Ashley deserts short-lived bid for Patisserie Valerie,"(Reuters) - British retail tycoon Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct has withdrawn its offer to buy scandal-hit British cafe chain owner Patisserie Holdings, a source told Reuters on Monday. Sports Direct on Friday offered to buy Patisserie out of administration to enlarge an empire stretching from department stores and sofa shops to lingerie, but wrote to Patisserie administrators KPMG saying it lacked the information required to continue bidding, British media reported on Sunday. Patisserie Valerie was plunged into crisis in October after its owner uncovered accounting irregularities. It hired KPMG in a last-ditch attempt to save the company, which traces its roots back to a shop founded 93 years ago. The source told Reuters that Sports Direct, Britain’s biggest sporting goods retailer, was given the opportunity to access detailed financial information. Chris Wootton, deputy chief financial officer for Sports Direct, wrote to KPMG partner David Costley-Wood, to say it had made an offer in excess of 15 million pounds ($19 million), only to be told it would need to raise this by as much as 2 million pounds, the Financial Times reported. “The fact the administrators felt confident enough to reject Sport Direct’s advances does at least indicate there is a competitive bidding process taking place, and that bodes well for the price tag on its (Patisserie’s) assets,” Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, said in an email. Media reports said Costa, the coffee chain bought by Coca-Cola last year, was also interested in Patisserie’s assets. Patisserie Holdings’ administrators, KPMG, declined to comment on the situation and Sports Direct was not immediately available to comment on its proposal. Ashley, who also owns English Premier League soccer club Newcastle United, made his name building budget chain Sports Direct and has more recently bought stakes in, or assets from, British retail businesses that have struggled to cope with challenges ranging from the rise of internet shopping to higher business property taxes and sluggish consumer spending. These businesses have included department store groups Debenhams and House of Fraser, home furnishings firm Sofa.com, Evans Cycles and Lingerie brand Agent Provocateur.

829216,Mattis says in close contact with European allies on INF treaty,"MANAMA (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday that the United States was in close contact with allies in Europe about the INF treaty and its implications for the region. “We are in close collaboration with our European allies... and we will continue to collaborate very closely with the treaty and its implications for European security,” Mattis said in a speech in Bahrain. “Eventually we have to look reality in the eye, that is not to mean that we are walking away from arms control. But arms control must be more than words on a paper, it must be actions,” Mattis added. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Oct. 20 that Washington planned to quit the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty which Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, and Ronald Reagan had signed in 1987. The pact eliminated all short- and intermediate-range land-based nuclear and conventional missiles held by both countries in Europe. Washington has cited Russia’s alleged violation of the treaty as its reason for leaving it, a charge Moscow denies. Russia in turn accuses Washington of breaking the pact. Gorbachev has denounced the U.S. decision to leave the INF that helped end the Cold War, saying it would heralded a new arms race which increased the risk of nuclear conflict.

839567,Preview: Avalanche at Blues,"Goals have not come easily of late for the Colorado Avalanche, who hope to break out when they visit the St. Louis Blues on Sunday. Colorado has been limited to fewer than two goals in four of its last five games, including Saturday’s 1-0 home triumph over Minnesota, and has netted more than three tallies only three times in its first 10 contests this season. Captain Gabriel Landeskog scored the lone goal for the Avalanche on Saturday to end his seven-game drought while Calvin Pickard posted the team’s second shutout of the campaign two days after it was blanked for the third time in 2016-17. St. Louis also has struggled offensively while scoring more than three goals only twice in its 12 games and two or fewer in eight of its last nine and six in a row - including Saturday’s 2-1 overtime win over Columbus, which netted a franchise-record 10 tallies in a victory over Montreal one night earlier. Vladimir Tarasenko scored his team-leading fifth goal at 4:17 of the extra session to end the Blues’ two-game skid and halt his seven-game goalless stretch after netting four tallies in his first four contests of the season. St. Louis has enjoyed most of its success this campaign at home, where it is 4-1-1 and has allowed more than two goals just once. TV: 5 p.m. ET, Altitude (Colorado), FSN Midwest (St. Louis) ABOUT THE AVALANCHE (5-5-0): Jarome Iginla will grab sole possession of 19th place on the all-time list when he plays in his 1,485th career game on Sunday. The 39-year-old right wing, who will pass Rod Brind’Amour, also is three penalty minutes shy of becoming the ninth player in NHL history to record 1,000 and 600 goals. Mikko Rantanen, a 20-year-old right wing from Finland, recorded an assist Saturday for his first point in 14 career contests. ABOUT THE BLUES (6-4-2): Alex Steen notched an assist in his second straight game but remains one goal shy of 200 for his career. The 32-year-old left wing also is nine assists away from 300 and 10 points shy of the 500 plateau. Ryan Reaves, who has yet to record a point this season, needs two penalty minutes to hit the 600 mark after collecting seven in Saturday’s victory. 1. The Blues are 29-1-2 at home since the start of 2015-16 - including the playoffs - when allowing fewer than three goals. 2.

839886,British Columbia avalanche kills 5 snowmobilers," (CNN)An afternoon snowmobiling in the Canadian Rocky Mountains turned deadly for five people, after a powerful avalanche swept them away. At least four groups of riders were out in remote, mountainous terrain near McBride, British Columbia, when the avalanche struck at 1:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET) Friday. Two people managed to activate rescue beacons -- a recommended emergency tool for those enjoying backcountry snow -- to alert authorities, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Two search-and-rescue technicians who happened to be snowmobiling in the area ""were on scene almost immediately,"" the police said in a news release. They were able to rescue several members of the groups caught in the slide.  The deceased were all from Alberta. They were identified as Vincent Eugene Loewen,  52, Vegreville; Tony Christopher Greenwood, 41, Grand Prairie County; Ricky Robinson, 55, Spruce Grove; Todd William Chisholm, 47, St. Albert; and John Harold Garley, 49, Stony Plain. Six people were take to a hospital; all have been released. Officials don't know yet what caused the avalanche. Rod Whelpton, who was snowmobiling in the area, said the avalanche was 700 meters (765 yards) wide.  Whelpton told reporters that he went out that day to have fun. He recalled the avalanche risk level being ""considerable"" -- in the middle of the danger scale. ""I went in believing it was a very safe, good area,"" he told reporters. ""It was very much a normal day, a nice day."" Major incident Canada averages about 12 avalanche deaths a year, according to Avalanche Canada spokeswoman Mary Clayton. The vast majority of those -- about 10 annually, according to a a 2014 report by that province's Coroners Service -- are in British Columbia. Most of those killed there tend to be from British Columbia or neighboring Alberta, and almost all of them are men. Roughly 41% of those caught up in such avalanches were snowmobiling, 34% were skiing and 13.5% were heli-skiing -- flying by helicopter to a secluded spot and then skiing. Avalanches can occur on their own or be triggered by humans. That's seemingly partly the case with Friday's ""very large, significant"" avalanche near McBride, a village about 450 miles (740 kilometers) northeast of Vancouver.  Karl Klassen, warning service manager at Avalanche Canada, said this event ""appears to be human-triggered,"" though weather and snow conditions played a factor as well. ""There are layers of concern in the snowpack in many parts of this region (and others),"" wrote Klassen on his nongovernmental organization's website. ""And a fairly significant weather event added ran and snow to the snowpack over the last few days, followed by clearing and cooling. ""This may have produced stresses in the snowpack capable of producing large avalanches."" Clayton, from the same organization, said that the number of avalanche deaths in Canada generally has been trickling down -- a fact that can be attributed to better awareness and preparation -- despite more and more people going into the backcountry. What makes Friday's incident unique is how many people died at once. ""When you have a lot of people killed in one incident, it can tell you a lot of things,"" Clayton said. ""A lot of people were clustered together. A lot of people were exposed to hazards at the same time.""

841012,Fitch Revises Gramercy's Outlook to Negative; Affirms IDR at 'BBB',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Gramercy Property Trust (NYSE: GPT) at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Negative from Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of the release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The Negative Outlook primarily reflects Fitch's expectation that, absent deleveraging actions, GPT's leverage will remain in the low to mid-6.0x range throughout the ratings horizon, which is above Fitch's 6.0x negative rating sensitivity. In addition, GPT has unencumbered asset coverage of net unsecured debt (UA/UD ratio) that is low for the current rating and below that of its similarly rated peer group. GPT has the ability to maintain leverage below 6.0x and elevate UA/UD via the issuance of additional equity or asset dispositions to reduce debt. GPT continues its evolution toward a more unsecured funding model and has multiple unsecured borrowings outstanding but, to date has not issued any public unsecured notes. These credit weaknesses are offset by GPT's fixed-charge coverage ratio which remains strong for the 'BBB' rating, albeit driven in part by shorter-term but less costly bank financing than the average REIT, strong management team and granular portfolio of predominantly single-tenant, industrial assets that should generate consistent cash flows. Fitch expects asset quality to improve over the next several years as a result of Gramercy's asset repositioning strategy of disposing of select single- and multi-tenant assets primarily in the office sector, and reinvesting those proceeds into target industrial, and, to a lesser extent, specialty assets. Elevated Leverage: Fitch projects leverage (excluding the effects of preferred stock) will settle in the low- to mid-6.0x range through 2019, higher than Fitch's negative rating sensitivity. Leverage was in the high-5.0x range for the TTM ended June 30, 2017 but increases to the mid-6.0x range pro forma for acquisitions and capital markets activity through August-end. Leverage increases by approximately 0.1x when including 50% of the company's preferred stock as debt. Fitch projects that GPT's fixed-charge coverage ratio will sustain at the high-3.0x level through 2019, driven by accretive acquisitions and developments, and partially offset by increased interest expense from unsecured bond issuances. GPT's fixed-charge coverage is solid for its 'BBB' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 3.6x for the TTM ended June 30, 2017, although GPT's capital structure has more shorter-term, but less expensive, bank financing that the average REIT. Portfolio Repositioning: In conjunction with the closing of the Chambers Street Merger in December 2015, Gramercy began actively managing its portfolio to optimize future performance by repositioning the combined portfolio. As of second quarter 2017 (2Q17), pro forma for investment activity through August-end, GPT's portfolio will generate approximately 78% of cash NOI from industrial assets, 18% from office and 4% from specialty retail. In comparison, as of 1Q16, GPT generated 52% of its revenue from office, 43% from industrial, and 4% from specialty retail. Fitch views the industrial real estate sector positively given the secular shift in the distribution of consumer goods. Fitch expects that well-located industrial assets will reap benefits from the emphasis on omni-channel trade and the potential for convergence within the retail and industrial sectors. Further reduction in office building exposure should also result in a less capital intensive portfolio to manage over time. As of 2Q17, pro forma for investment activity through August-end, GPT's largest market, Chicago, represents 11.0% of annual base rents, followed by Dallas (6.7%), Atlanta (5.7%) and Los Angeles (5.4%). The portfolio is well diversified across over 350 different tenants and many industry classifications, and key tenant risk is moderate with the largest tenant, FedEx, accounting for 5.6% of pro forma revenues. Evolving Portfolio: GPT's investment strategy emphasizes investment in industrial assets versus a specific lease format such as long-term triple-net leased assets. Alternative formats to the triple-net lease model, such as net leased and modified gross leased assets, provide real estate owners greater upside (and downside) due to the exposure to operating and enhanced leasing risks. Triple-net leased tenants bear the risk of rising taxes, increased maintenance costs and insurance needs, versus the net lease and modified gross lease models, which shift some of the expense (and risk) to the property owner. Further, GPT's acquisition strategy includes assets with significantly shorter lease terms than typically seen in in long-term single-tenant net lease transactions, resulting in potentially higher cash flow volatility. GPT's weighted average lease term is 7.2 years, less than the net lease REIT average of approximately 10 years and more than a gross lease-focused industrial REIT which is typically in the mid-single digits. Fitch expects lease tenor to decline as the company completes its asset repositioning plans, targeting an average lease term of approximately 5-7 years across the portfolio. Transition to Unsecured Funding Model: As of 2Q17, approximately 80% of GPT's outstanding indebtedness is unsecured, up from 65.3% as of Dec. 31, 2015. Fitch expects GPT to continue its evolution toward a fully unsecured funding model; GPT currently has four series of unsecured notes totalling $500 million and $1.45 billion of unsecured term loans outstanding. Fitch expects GPT will continue to reduce its secured debt as existing mortgages mature and through new unencumbered acquisitions, which should improve financial flexibility going forward. GPT has significantly higher exposure to bank debt than the broader REIT universe. GPT's bank borrowing exposure - the sum of outstanding amounts on unsecured revolving facilities and term loans - represents approximately 60% of total debt versus the REIT sector average of approximately 16%. Fitch expects the company to repay a portion of this bank debt via unsecured bond issuance as the capital structure matures. Weak UA/UD Ratio: UA/UD is 1.7x when applying a stressed 9% capitalization rate to unencumbered NOI. Fitch considers a UA/UD ratio less than 2.0x as below investment-grade. Internal Growth / Earnings: Fitch expects 2017 same store NOI (SSNOI) growth to be negative; the company's SSNOI was down 1.9% in 2Q17 after increasing 0.2% in 1Q17. The declines in 2Q17 SSNOI were primarily caused by vacancies in the company's industrial portfolio. Fitch expects SSNOI growth to turn positive in 2018 based on estimated contractual rent increases ranging from 1.0%-2.0% for the portfolio and on stabilizing occupancy. Experienced Management: Senior management has significant experience in commercial real estate, investing, and asset management. The team is led by Gordon DuGan and Benjamin Harris, who have experience working together at W.P. Carey, a net-lease REIT. Together the two carry more than 40 years of direct real estate investment and management experience, while Gramercy's eight senior officers have an average of approximately 20 years of real estate experience. Negative Outlook: The Outlook revision to Negative principally reflects Fitch's expectation that the company's leverage will settle in the low- to mid-6.0x range through 2019, higher than Fitch's negative rating sensitivity of 6.0x and higher than comparable 'BBB' rated peers. In addition, the company's UA/UD ratio of 1.7x, which is down from 2.1x as of June 30, 2016, is weak for the rating. GPT has the ability to reduce leverage below 6.0x and elevate UA/UD with the issuance of additional equity or via asset sales to reduce debt. The company has access to the equity capital markets as evidenced by the public equity raise of over $270 million of capital in April 2017 and the utilization of its at-the-market (ATM) equity issuance program that has raised an additional $20 million in 2017. The company's common stock currently trades at an estimated 10% premium to consensus net asset value according to SNL Financial, allowing management to issue additional equity accretively. DERIVATION SUMMARY GPT's closest rated peer is Lexington Realty Trust (LXP; BBB/Stable). LXP is focused on industrial and office properties and has a similar leverage policy to GPT, although LXP's leverage is currently below 6.0x; both companies are well diversified by tenant, industry and geography. GPT is further along in an asset repositioning program to reduce office exposure, and has more industrial real estate exposure, which Fitch considers a positive given the underlying strength and future prospects for that sector. Liberty Property Trust (LPT; BBB/Stable) has also reduced its suburban office exposure and sought to become a majority industrial property company. LPT's rating is driven by expected leverage sustaining in the 5.5x-6.0x range along with proven longstanding access to the public unsecured bond market. STAG Industrial's (BBB/Stable) portfolio is focused on secondary U.S. industrial markets. Fitch expects STAG to operate through the cycle with leverage sustaining in the low- to mid-5.0x range. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Annual same-store NOI growth of negative 1.5% in 2017 due to declining same store occupancy and positive 1.5%-2.0% growth in 2018 and 2019 reflecting flat same store occupancy, contractual rent escalations and positive rent spreads; --Net acquisitions of $1 billion in 2017 and $800 million in 2018 and 2019; --Equity issuance of $560 million and $500 million in 2017 and 2018, respectively, used to fund external growth on a leverage-neutral basis; --Common share dividends of $230 million in 2017 are expected to grow by $30 million-$40 million per year as the company issues additional equity; --$900 million of unsecured bond issuances in 2018 and $500 million in 2019; --Approximately $100 million of maintenance capital expenditures in 2017 and 2018 declining to $35 million per year in 2019. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 6x; --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining below 2.5x Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Revising the Outlook to Stable at a 'BBB' IDR: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining at or below 6x (pro forma 2Q17 leverage was is in the mid-6.0x range at June 30, 2017; --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining above 3.5x (FCC was 3.6x for the TTM ended June 30, 2017); --Fitch's expectation of a 2.0x UA/UD ratio at a 9% stressed cap rate. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: Fitch calculates GPT's liquidity coverage ratio is 1.2x for July 1, 2017 to Dec. 31, 2018, pro forma for recent acquisitions and dispositions subsequent to June 30, 2017. Fitch defines liquidity coverage as sources of liquidity (unrestricted cash, availability under the unsecured revolving credit facility, expected retained cash flows from operating activities after dividend payments) divided by uses of liquidity (debt maturities, development expenditures and recurring capital expenditures). Debt maturities are manageable through 2020. No year represents more than 11% of total debt, except for the company's $850 million revolver expiring in 2020; $750 million of term loans come due in 2021. GPT recently amended and upsized its existing $175 million unsecured term due in January 2023 to $400 million; the term loan will have lower spreads and a swapped fixed rate of approximately 3%. The company's payout ratio has increased significantly over the past two years, with GPT paying out 85.3% of its adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) in dividends in 2Q17, compared with 76.9% for 4Q16 and 50.3% in 2015. The higher payout ratio is the result of a combination of lower AFFO per share and an increase in the company's quarterly dividend per share to $0.375 from $0.33 effective 4Q16. Fitch expects the company's payout ratio to sustain in the 70% range on a long-term basis. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Gramercy Property Trust: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB'; --Preferred stock at 'BB+'. GPT Operating Partnership LP --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured term loans at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured convertible notes at 'BBB'. GPT Property Trust LP: --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured term loans at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.

841379,"'Bonnie and Clyde' duo called home to say goodbye, hostages say"," (CNN)Hours before a shootout that stopped a multistate crime spree, police say, a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde burst into one more home and held their last captives as Florida law enforcement officers pursued them. The duo kept the residents -- a Pensacola couple and their 2-year-old daughter -- inside with them at gunpoint Thursday night and, after explaining their situation, used the homeowners' phones to call relatives to say goodbye, the residents say. Both saw the end coming, one of those residents says. ""They were under no illusion,"" Ian Gunnell told CNN affiliate WIAT on Friday. ""They were in a bad place and they knew things were going to go bad."" Sometime after taking over the Gunnells' home, Blake Edward Fitzgerald and his girlfriend, Brittany Nicole Harper, stole the family's vehicle and drove east into the next county, where police caught up with them early Friday, leading to a standoff in which officers shot and killed Fitzgerald and took an injured Harper into custody, authorities said. 'Bonnie and Clyde' shootout in Florida: Male suspect dead, partner wounded Authorities say Fitzgerald, 30, and Harper, 30, both of Missouri, went on a crime run that included kidnappings and robberies in Alabama, Georgia and Florida over at least five days.  The pair were characterized by media and law enforcement as a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde, after the infamous Depression-era outlaws. The U.S. Marshals Service had offered a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to their arrests. End of the road in Florida Police said they began catching up to Fitzgerald and Harper on Thursday night, when someone reported a robbery in Pensacola, a coastal city in Florida's panhandle. Witnesses reported a description of the vehicle the robbers were in, and after police saw the vehicle, a chase was on, Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan said. The vehicle was found abandoned Thursday night in a Pensacola neighborhood. It was at about that time, the Gunnells say, that Fitzgerald and Harper entered their home with a gun. After some tense moments, everyone settled down, Ian Gunnell told WIAT. ""They were telling us why they were here,"" he said. ""They were on the run, in trouble, needed somewhere to stay right now."" Harper talked to the Gunnells' 2-year-old daughter, said Ian's wife, April. ""[She] kept saying, 'It's OK, it's OK. I know you're frightened,'"" April Gunnell told WIAT. Fitzgerald and Harper left in the Gunnells' truck, and the family called police. Authorities saw the truck on Interstate 10 at about 12:35 a.m. Friday, and Escambia County sheriff's deputies chased the truck into neighboring Santa Rosa County, Morgan said. Fitzgerald and Harper left the truck and tried to enter a home; Escambia County deputies shot and killed Fitzgerald outside and arrested Harper, Morgan said. Morgan said his deputies ""returned fire."" State Attorney Bill Eddins, in a news conference Friday, declined to say whether Fitzgerald fired or pointed a weapon, but said a preliminary examination of the evidence indicated the shooting was justified. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement will investigate the shooting, as is standard procedure, Eddins said. Harper was being treated Friday at a hospital with unspecified injuries. Eddins said police were in the process of arresting her on preliminary charges of home invasion robbery, false imprisonment and grand theft auto. Hotel kidnapping, vehicle thefts Authorities say one of the spree's earliest incidents happened on the morning of January 31 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Fitzgerald and Harper entered a Microtell Inn, where they told a clerk they were stranded and asked to get coffee and use a computer, said the Mircrotel's manager, Rikesh Patel. The pair eventually robbed the clerk at gunpoint, and then forced him into his own vehicle, which they stole and drove to Hoover, Alabama, police said. In Hoover that morning, with the clerk still with them, Fitzgerald allegedly pointed a gun at a woman in the parking lot of a McDonald's restaurant and demanded the keys to her vehicle, Hoover police Capt. Gregg Rector said. But the woman refused and got the attention of someone else, so Fitzgerald and Harper drove away again in the clerk's vehicle, with the clerk still inside, Rector said. They eventually dropped the clerk off in a neighborhood in Vestavia Hills, Alabama, about 60 miles from Tuscaloosa, said Vestavia Hills police Lt. Kevin York. Then, York said, Fitzgerald parked the vehicle and walked to a home, where he put a gun to a man's head and forced the man's wife into the couple's Ford Edge. Fitzgerald drove the Edge with the woman inside, and picked up Harper, York said. Fitzgerald and Harper dropped the woman off in her bathrobe behind a medical center unharmed, York said. ""Thankfully, no innocent member of the public has been physically harmed by this modern-day Bonnie and Clyde,"" said U.S. Marshal Martin Keely in a press release Thursday.

842938,"Hilary Swank Talks About Her Pay for Boys Don't Cry, Which Won Her an Oscar","    Oscar gold may be priceless, but the hard-earned payout that helped Hilary Swank get there didn’t necessarily fill her coffers. During a recent appearance on Chelsea Handler’s Netflix talk show Chelsea, the two-time Oscar winner revealed that she was paid just $3,000 to work on the film that would eventually win her her first statuette: Boys Don’t Cry. “So when I did Boys Don’t Cry, I was 24 years old,” she said during a dinner-style round-table chat involving Selma filmmaker Ava DuVernay, actress Connie Britton and Miss USA Deshauna Barber. In her groundbreaking performance, Swank played real-life transgender man Brandon Teena, who was raped and murdered in 1993.   “I made $3,000. In order to have health insurance, you have to make $5,000. So I didn’t even know that I didn’t have health insurance until I went and tried to get a prescription filled,” Swank, 42, recalled. “They said, ‘That’s $160.’ I went, ‘Um, did you try my insurance?’ They said, ‘Mmm-hmm.’ I had an Academy Award, no health insurance.”     Swank would go on to win a second Best Actress Oscar five years later for her pull-no-punches turn as an ill-fated female boxer in Clint Eastwood‘s 2004 drama Million Dollar Baby. The victory, which solidified her reputation as one of Hollywood’s most versatile and astonishing actresses, didn’t appear to help her at the negotiating table.   “Then I win my second Academy Award, and the next couple movies later, I get offered a movie,” she said. “But the male hadn’t had any kind of critical success, but had been in a movie where he was hot. And he got offered $10 million, and I got offered $500,000. That’s the truth. The truth,” she added, to the shock of her companions at the interview. “So I said, ‘No,’ ” she added. “And then they went and found a newcomer who did it for $50,000. So they made a savings of [$450,000], probably to give the guy his bonuses.” These days Swank, who recently appeared in the 2014 indie drama You’re Not You, has been branching out beyond Hollywood. The actress recently announced that she’s launching a line of athletic and leisure wear called Mission Statement, which she describes as a mix of “high performance and high fashion.”",3.0

From adorable animal faces to intricately detailed emoji-like designs, the singer practically has a permanent photo of everything under the sun, including her latest ink addition — a tiny sketch of a planet. But Cyrus seems to be confused on exactly which planet that is.     Source: Miley Cyrus/Instagram
                             The singer, 23, debuted her fresh ink — a tiny gray planet on her forearm — courtesy of tattoo artist Lauren Winzer, on Instagram Tuesday afternoon with the caption: “permaaaa skinnnnn arrrrrttttt by daaaa mosssst bad a$$ @laurenwinzer  #lilbbjupiter.” But for those with a strong interest in space (or anyone with an ability to google the planetary system) probably noticed a slight error in Cyrus’ caption: the mini, sphere-shaped design isn’t Jupiter, it’s Saturn.  Unfortunately for the singer, her new tiny tat isn’t a miniature replica of the fifth planet from the sun. Based on the visible rings orbiting the star’s ink, Cyrus actually had the sixth planet from the sun, Saturn, permanently etched into her arm. Jupiter has rings as well, but they are much fainter. Lucky for her, the tat still incredibly cute — if not cuter than a “lilbbjupiter.” Whether or not Cyrus just suffered a typo or meant to actually get Jupiter, there’s no doubt the small inked design makes a nice addition to her growing tattoo collection.

847870,UPDATE 4-India takes control of infrastructure group IL&FS to stem contagion,"* NCLT approves application to remove IL&FS board * Govt will ensure no more defaults take place * Serious fraud office to investigate company, subsidiaries * Govt intervention could derail debt restructuring plan (Adds details from govt statement) By Abhirup Roy, Promit Mukherjee and Manoj Kumar MUMBAI/NEW DELHI, Oct 1 (Reuters) - India on Monday took control of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS), in a rare move that it said was needed to protect the country’s financial system and markets from potential collapse. IL&FS, a major infrastructure financing and construction company, defaulted on some of its debt obligations in recent weeks triggering wider concerns about risk in the rest of the country’s financial sector. The government said it would replace the board of IL&FS with six selected nominees and ensure IL&FS has the liquidity needed to ensure no more defaults take place and the infrastructure projects are implemented smoothly. “The government was compelled to take this extraordinary step ... to prevent further mismanagement in order to protect public interest,” the government said in a statement. It also said the government needed to ensure the solvency of IL&FS to maintain financial stability in the country. IL&FS’s problems could threaten India’s economic growth as lenders cut exposure to what are known as non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) in India or shadow banks. More concerning, analysts say, is that potential defaults at so-called shadow banks could cripple many mutual funds that are heavily invested in their commercial paper. These non-bank finance companies have played a major role in lending growth in India in the last two years, as Indian banks, saddled with roughly $150 billion of bad debt, slowed lending. A string of defaults by IL&FS has led to a series of credit rating downgrades on the company and its subsidiaries that hold some of its 910 billion rupee ($12.48 billion) debt pile. Its fall from grace has spooked financial markets and sparked fears of contagion. India has rarely stepped in to take control of a private company. The government’s attempt to take control of debt-laden realty firm Unitech Ltd in late 2017 was stalled by the Supreme Court. India did take control of Satyam Computer Services in 2009 after an accounting scandal. The government applied to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Monday to remove the board of IL&FS. The NCLT approved the government’s interim application to replace IL&FS’s board with six nominees, including the managing director of Kotak Mahindra Bank Uday Kotak as IL&FS’ non-executive chairman. “The current IL&FS crisis could have an adverse impact on the financial stability of the economy,” Sanjay Shorey a lawyer for the government told the NCLT, a quasi-judicial body for corporate grievances. IL&FS has infrastructure and financial assets worth more than 1.15 trillion rupees ($15.77 billion) but its debts are the result of “mismanaged borrowings in the past,” the government said. The government fears that IL&FS’s inability to finance and support the projects could damage the infrastructure sector. “There is an emergent need to immediately stop further financial defaults and also take measures to resolve defaulted dues to the claimants,” the government statement said. The government also said the Serious Fraud Investigation Office had been ordered to look into IL&FS and its subsidiaries. The government’s intervention has cast doubt over IL&FS’ restructuring plan for which it has just secured shareholder support. “The government decision to intervene ... could be disruptive at this stage,” Shriram Subramanian, managing director at proxy advisory firm InGovern, said. IL&FS on Sunday said its shareholders had approved a plan to raise funds via debt and equity issuances. Earlier, the company had said its board would develop a “comprehensive” restructuring plan including asset sales and a rights issue. India’s Life Insurance Corp Ltd, which is IL&FS’ biggest shareholder with a more than 25 percent stake, said last week it would participate in the rights issue. IL&FS’s other large investors are Japan’s ORIX Corp with a 23.54 percent stake and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) with 12.56 percent. India’s biggest lender by assets, State Bank of India (SBI) , also owns a 6.42 percent stake in IL&FS. LIC and Orix did not respond to requests for comment on the Indian government’s move to seize control of IL&FS on Monday. SBI and ADIA declined to comment, while IL&FS said it would not comment.

853513,Craig Strickland Death: Wife Prays For Strength Before His Funeral,"Following the burial of her late husband Craig Strickland on Tuesday, Helen Strickland is sharing the letter she slipped into his jacket pocket before saying goodbye.   “I love you with all my heart,” she wrote. “I will miss doing life with you on this earth. You were my person and are the love of my earthly life. Thank you for sharing the last few years you had with me. I know you are in better hands than mine. The Lord is taking care of you, and loves you more than I could ever imagine. I can’t wait to see you again in heaven. I love you … I can’t say that enough. I will see you soon.”   Helen posted a photo of the letter on Instagram, along with the caption, “Today I buried my husband. This is a picture of the letter I put in his jacket pocket. I love him with every part of my heart, but I love our God more … and I know my God loves Craig and I more than we could ever imagine. Therefore, God has a purpose. He makes everything beautiful in its time.”   She continued, “Craig established relationships with each of us so that he could see us again. So let us love one another like Craig did. Let us pray for strangers. And let us establish relationships with one another with the goal of establishing Christ-like relationships so that we can see each other again in heaven.”   The night before her husband’s funeral, Helen also reached out to her social media followers for strength.   “Dear friends, please pray that I may have strength tomorrow as I walk through the most difficult experience I’ve ever gone through in my life,” Helen posted to Instagram on Monday.    “I am so thankful for every moment I had with Craig and I am thankful the Lord is taking care of him now. More than ever our family will need your prayers. I’m so thankful for every person that has poured out their love to us.”   The body of the 29-year-old country singer was recovered on Jan. 4, a week after he set off on a duck-hunting trip with buddy Chase Morland in winter storm Goliath.   Morland had tweeted an ominous message foreshadowing the tragic turn of events, which Strickland then retweeted.    “In case we don’t come back, @BackroadCRAIG and I are going right through Winter Storm Goliath to kill ducks in Oklahoma. #IntoTheStorm,” Morland wrote in the early morning hours on Dec. 27.   Helen is encouraging everyone to join her in celebrating Craig’s memory – digitally if not in person. “If you are unable to physically attend, I hope that you will join our family via webcast at crosschurch.com/watchlive,” she wrote. “I love you all as Craig did. Goodnight.”",3.0
858333,"House ignores veto threat, approves $622 million Zika bill","Washington (CNN)Shrugging off a veto threat from the White House, the GOP-led House of Representatives approved a $622 million funding package to combat the spread of the Zika virus. The bill passed mostly along party lines, 241-184. Even with the bill's passage late on Wednesday evening the effort to send the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal agencies emergency money is still weeks away. That's because the House measure will have to be reconciled with a $1.1 billion Senate measure that passed on Tuesday. The Obama administration, meanwhile, is continuing to press for the full $1.9 billion in emergency spending it requested in February, and officials continue to criticize Hill Republicans for not responding to what they say is a growing public health crisis. ""This is the specific request that was put forward by our public health experts. They've been very clear about what is necessary."" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday ahead of the House vote. House Republicans pointed out that the administration is already using $600 million to address the Zika virus, so the additional money in this bill adds up to over $1 billion dollars being spent this year. They also pledged to have more money in next year's spending bills specifically for Zika. ""We will have hundreds of millions of dollars in that bill for next year's Zika response, so to suggest that somebody is being shortchanged -- the money is just being prudently laid out at the appropriate pace and paid for along the way,"" said Oklahoma GOP Rep. Tom Cole, who chairs a key spending panel allocating money to the Department of Health and Human Services. Democrats complained that the GOP funding measure, unlike the version the Senate approved, takes money from existing federal programs aimed at fighting to Ebola virus and shifts it to deal with Zika. During debate on the House floor they reminded Republicans that they supported previous spending bills that funded responses to natural disasters that didn't require that those emergency funds be offset with cuts to other programs. ""When those disasters struck, we didn't steal money from prior disaster response, like the emergency funding provided for hurricane damage in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida; storms in West Virginia; and tornadoes in Oklahoma and Kentucky,"" said New York Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey, citing a bill approved last year for wildfires in the West and hurricanes on the East Coast.  Earnest piled on the GOP's decision to use money designated to protect any new threat from Ebola for Zika, calling it ""a dumb approach.""   He continued to push for the full $1.9 billion, but did not say the President would veto a bill if it Congress ultimately approved a plan similar to the $1.1 billion one that the Senate passed.  The House Zika legislation will be attached to a separate annual funding bill for veterans and military construction projects. But the vote on that isn't expected until next week so the talks with the Senate on a final bill won't happen right away.    The effort to hammer out a final package with the Senate will likely extend into June because Congress is scheduled to leave for a week-long Memorial Day recess at the end of next week. According to reports from state health agencies 46 states now have confirmed cases of Zika, but the majority of those are from individuals who have traveled to affected countries. So far there are no instances of mosquito transmitted infections in the continental U.S. CNN's Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",4.5
860456,GOP Senators Hire Female Prosecutor to Question Christine Blasey Ford,"Senate Republicans have hired outside counsel Rachel Mitchell to question embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused him of sexual assault. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley announced the news in a statement Tuesday night, saying, “I promised Dr. Ford that I would do everything in my power to avoid a repeat of the ‘circus’ atmosphere in the hearing room that we saw the week of September 4. I’ve taken this additional step to have questions asked by expert staff counsel to establish the most fair and respectful treatment of the witnesses possible.” Mitchell, a registered Republican who serves as bureau chief of sex crimes for the Maricopa County Attorney’s office in Phoenix, Arizona, will ask questions on behalf of GOP senators while Democrats do their own questioning, Grassley said. The move comes as Republicans are facing criticism for having only white men on the Senate Judiciary Committee. As The New York Times writes, hiring Mitchell “allows the 11 Republicans on the committee — all white men — to avoid the image on national television of them grilling Dr. Blasey.” The Times also notes that Blasey had sought to have the senators question her instead of a lawyer.  Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader, referred to Mitchell as a “female assistant,” a comment that some have criticized as sexist. On Thursday, Ford, a 51-year-old research psychologist and professor at Palo Alto University, will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about her claim that Kavanaugh pinned her down on a bed, groped her and tried to remove her clothes at a high school party in the early 1980s. Kavanaugh, 53, who has strongly denied the allegation, will also be questioned in Thursday’s hearing. Democrats and Republicans are debating whether Kavanaugh’s second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, will also be discussed during the hearing, according to CNN. Ramirez, 53, has claimed that Kavanaugh exposed his penis, put it in her face, “caused her to touch it without her consent as she pushed him away” and laughed about it during a dorm-room party in Yale’s Lawrance Hall while they were freshmen in the 1983-84 school year. Kavanaugh has also denied this allegation. The Senate Judiciary Committee, facing pressure from the White House, has moved to speed up Kavanaugh’s confirmation process by scheduling a vote on his nomination Friday, the Wall Street Journal reports.

862260,Man who rented flat to Paris attackers gets four year jail sentence,"PARIS (Reuters) - A man who rented a flat to several Islamist militant gunmen involved in the November 2015 Paris attacks was sentenced to four years in prison by a French court on Friday, on charges of helping them escape arrest or detection. The attackers, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, Chakib Akrouh and Hasna Ait Boulahcen, hid in Jawad Bendaoud’s flat on the outskirts of Paris after they and a group of other gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people on Nov. 13, 2015. Bendaoud had previously been cleared by another court in Paris in February of last year. It had argued there was not enough proof he had knowingly helped the attackers by renting them a flat. Paris prosecutors immediately appealed, however. The only surviving man suspected of being involved in the attacks on Paris cafes and restaurants and the Stade de France stadium, Salah Abdeslam, is in a French prison awaiting a trial that may not start until late 2020. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison by a Belgian court last April for trying to kill police during a shootout in Brussels in 2016, after fleeing Paris on the night of the 2015 attacks. He was eventually arrested in Belgium. Reporting by Emmanuel Jarry; Writing by Sarah White; Editing by Hugh Lawson",4.0
863553,Chief Justice John Roberts' challenging 2016,"Washington (CNN)It hasn't been an easy term for Chief Justice John Roberts.  He lost a dear friend on the Court with the sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February. Then, with little time to spare, he led the court as it organized a ""lying in repose"" for thousands of mourners.  At one point the lines extended around the block. On an administrative level, Roberts had to untangle the cases that Scalia had been assigned, as well as those where he might have been writing a separate concurrence or dissent.  Kennedy's swings, Scalia's death define volatile Supreme Court term On top of that, he became a punching bag for Republicans on the presidential trail who criticized him for his vote on Obamacare. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley even took to the floor of the Senate to criticize Roberts.  ""He would be well served to address the reality, not the perception, that too often there is little difference between the actions of the court and the actions of the political branches,"" Grassley said. ""So, physician, heal thyself.""  Court watchers who analyze the tea leaves during the course of the term believe Roberts might have lost a couple of majority opinions when Scalia died, because of the shift in the vote. The turn to the right many expected, with cases on affirmative action, abortion, and public sector unions, for instance, never happened.  Its worth noting that the challenges of a short-handed court will likely continue into next term if there is no vote for Garland.  ""While the impact of Justice Scalia's death has loomed large over the Court and the Chief this term, it could be an even bigger deal next term, as seen in how far behind the justices are in filling their docket,"" said Steve Vladeck, CNN contributor and professor of law at American University Washington College of Law. ""Without more confidence that he'll soon have a full bench, the chief justice may have a lot to do with the paucity of granted cases thus far.""  Earlier in the term when the Court ruled in favor of victims of terrorism and their families in a 6-2 split, clearing the way for them to collect nearly $2 billion from the central bank of Iran, Roberts was in dissent, joined only by Justice Sonia Sotomayor.  At issue was a law passed by Congress that was aimed specifically at securing restitution in the case at hand.  Roberts said Congress had interfered with the role of the judiciary in passing the law while the case was pending in the courts.  He said the law ""violates the bedrock rule"" that the ""judicial power is vested in the judicial branch alone.""  Roberts penned the last case of the term when the eight justices voted unanimously in favor of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, a vote Scalia would have most likely endorsed. That might have been the most consequential opinion the chief justice wrote for the term limiting the activities that can be considered corrupt under federal law.  Supreme Court vacates former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell's conviction ""Setting up a meeting, talking to another official, or organizing an event (or agreeing to do so) -- without more -- "" Roberts wrote, does not fit into the definition of an official act. The case will make it harder for prosecutors and was closely watched by politicians and those who seek their favor.   Roberts has stressed one thing in recent years: He cares about the institution of the Court, and wants to make sure that the acrimony between the public branches does not bleed over to his branch of government. Here's how he put it in 2014 in a talk at the University of Nebraska:    ""They are not getting along very well these days among themselves. It's a period of real partisan rancor,"" he said. ""I don't want it to spill over and affect us.""  The court got its job done this term with little rancor. For the most part, it agreed to disagree agreeably as it gaveled out another term.  That alone might have been a victory for the chief. ",4.0

866650,U.S. judge issues final order upholding Alabama same-sex marriage,"(Reuters) - A federal judge in Alabama has issued a permanent injunction barring state officials from denying same-sex couples the right to marry in that state, according to court documents made public on Wednesday. The order, filed on Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Callie Granade, came in response to a 2014 lawsuit challenging Alabama’s ban on same-sex marriage, finalizing a decision Granade made in early 2015 that the state law was unconstitutional. The legality of gay marriage was at the center of a national debate until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2015 that the U.S. Constitution provided same-sex couples the right to marry. Despite that order, Alabama officials continued to resist the change in the law. Last month, Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore was suspended for issuing an administrative order to state probate judges that they should not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In March, the Alabama Supreme Court dismissed petitions by opponents of same-sex marriage asking to reinstate the ban on those unions but refused to vacate or withdraw its own March 2015 ruling in favor of the same-sex marriage ban, made just months before the U.S. Supreme Court ruling. “This brings a finality by permanently prohibiting Alabama from enforcing its marriage laws which are discriminating against gay couples,” said Susan Watson, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama. “Given Alabama’s fierce resistance, this permanent relief was required to ensure marriage equality in the state.” Officials from the office of Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange, who is named in the lawsuit, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. Strange’s attorneys had asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed because the state was currently complying with the federal law. But Granade said in her ruling that “promising to sin no more” did not render a permanent injunction unnecessary. The actions of the suspended chief justice and other officials suggested that other attempts may be made to undermine the constitutional right of same-sex couples to marry, she wrote. “It cannot be said with assurance that there is no reasonable expectation that Alabama’s unconstitutional marriage laws will not again be enforced,” the order said.

875945,Dylan Sprouse Stars in New J Brand Campaign – Shot By His Twin Brother Cole!,"Twins Dylan and Cole Sprouse, 26, have spent most of their lives together in front of the camera, starting from their Big Daddy debut nearly 20 years ago to their days on The Suite Life of Zack and Cody. Fast forward to 2019, and while the brothers remain close, they’re busy pursuing their own paths and passions. Dylan runs All-Wise Meadery, which he founded in 2017 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The location recently opened a taproom with food, drinks and, of course, mead. He also has three new movies being released this year. Cole has a lead role on the hit CW series Riverdale and in his free time he photographs everyone from Kendall Jenner in high-fashion editorials to his girlfriend and co-star Lili Reinhart. Now Cole is turning the camera on his brother for J Brand denim’s newest campaign. The brand recruited Dylan to star in its Spring 2019 ad campaign — and enlisted Cole to capture the shots. “I’ve been watching Cole do photography since he was really discovering his style so I was amazed after all this time to discover that he’s very professional and put together on a shoot (despite doing the cartoon photographer ‘Yes darling!’ bulls—),” Dylan tells PEOPLE. Dylan adds, “I was excited they [J Brand] gave Cole and I the opportunity to work with each other in this new format. It was very cool of them.” Looking for more style content? Click here to subscribe to the PeopleStyle Newsletter for amazing shopping discounts, can’t-live-without beauty products and more Even though working as photographer and subject works a little bit differently than as actors side-by-side, Dylan says the two were able to get into their groove without missing a beat. “Having worked together most of our lives, you can imagine we’re pretty synced up by now,” he says. “While this medium is entirely different than acting, I’m familiar with his photography so I’m aware of what would compliment it as the subject.” Ultimately, he says, the duo was able to capture the essence of J Brand perfectly: “stylish, accessible with a classic Americana vibe.”",3.5
885566,Mayor vows to protect undocumented immigrants," (CNN)Jorge Elorza, the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, vowed to protect undocumented immigrants in his city on Wednesday, becoming the latest in a series of mayors across the country who have said they would defy President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promise to aggressively deport illegal immigrants. Elorza told CNN's Carol Costello that, regardless of any new policies, his city will ""stand up for our undocumented immigrant families."" ""People in the community, they are concerned and they are scared because of what they heard from Donald Trump during the campaign. And for me it's very important to reassure all our residents that, regardless of what they hear at the national level, they are safe here in Providence and we have their back,"" insisted Elorza. Asked by Costello if this stance would change when it comes to undocumented immigrants who commit violent crimes, a scenario that Trump continually referenced during his presidential campaign, Elorza said the rules were clear. ""If folks are committing crimes or if there's a criminal warrant, those folks, there's cooperation with the ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement], not just in Providence, but across the country"" he said. The people he would endeavor to protect, he told Costello, are those living ""law-abiding lives."" ""This isn't about folks who are committing crimes or violent crimes or have criminal detainers against them. This is about otherwise law-abiding folks, just going about their business. They are part of our community and mayors across the country are going to continue to stand up for them,"" Elorza said. Despite Trump's campaign promises to forcibly deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, as well as to block federal funding to so-called ""sanctuary-cities,"" Elorza said he was heartened by what he perceived as a softening by the President-elect on the issue. ""What has been encouraging up to this point is to hear that Donald Trump has walked away from his more concerning and frankly, terrifying rhetoric to go, sort of, house-by-house and door-to-door to find folks who don't have documented immigration status,"" he said. Yet, regardless of any new federal laws on immigration that Trump may or may not put into place, Elorza said he would stand by the undocumented immigrants in his city, and that they should not be afraid. ""Mayors across the country are standing up to speak for them because they are part of our community"" he said, ""We will make sure they're safe,"" he added. ",4.0

888550,Imagine a world without giraffes,"John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat, Facebook and email. This story is part of CNN's ""Vanishing"" series. Learn more about the sixth extinction and get involved.  (CNN)It's the tallest land-based mammal in the world.  Its construction-crane neck, toothpick legs, knocked knees and two-story stature make it an awkwardly lovable favorite of children's book authors and cartoonists. This animal brings an odd sort of wonder to the savannahs of Africa.  But perhaps it's best for us to start imagining a world without the humble giraffe.  The International Union for Conservation of Nature on Thursday up-listed this goofy creature -- known for its craning neck, which helps it reach tree-top leaves its competitors can't -- to its ""vulnerable"" status, meaning the animal is at high risk for extinction. It moves up from the category called ""least concern.""  The reason: a sharp 36% to 40% decline in giraffe populations in recent decades.  In 1985, the group said, there were as many as 163,452 giraffes.  Now the estimate is 97,562. This puts the giraffe in good company. The elephant, the orangutan, certain bees, coral -- so many of the Earth's mind-blowingly cool creatures face extinction risk these days. If poaching rates continue, some fear African elephants will be extinct in 20 years. Scientists worry coral reefs will mostly vanish by 2050 because humans continue pumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere, warming up the oceans and making them more acidic, and making life hard for coral.  I've spent much of 2016 reporting on the mass extinction event that's brewing all around the world for a CNN series called ""Vanishing."" That reporting will debut on CNN International on Friday and on this website Monday morning.  If there's one take-away from my travels, it's this: We can't take species for granted.  We too often assume they'll survive one generation to the next -- that those elephants or giraffes will be out there, somewhere.  They won't. Not unless we humans drastically change our ways.  In California, I met with Anthony Barnosky, executive director of Stanford University's Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, and a global expert on extinction. He told me that we humans have -- at the very most -- 20 years to change the way we treat nature or we will bring about the sixth mass extinction event in the entire history of Earth. We are talking dinosaur-ending stuff here -- as in three-quarters of all known species, not just the cute and iconic ones, could vanish in a couple of centuries. Having trouble imagining that world?  ""The best way to envision the sixth mass extinction is to look outside and then just imagine that three out of every four of the species that were common out there are gone,"" he said. ""That would be a very impoverished landscape."" It certainly would.  If you're not moved by that, consider the consequences for humans, too.  ""We are basically annihilating the life on our planet -- and that is the only known life ... in the entire universe,"" Paul Ehrlich, also of Stanford, told me. ""It's life that shaped the planet, that made it possible for us to live here. It's life that still makes it possible for us to live here. (If) we don't have the diversity of other organisms, we're done."" What's causing the collapse?  Barnosky has boiled it all down to three words: ""power, food and money.""  Power, meaning we're burning fossil fuels for electricity, transit and heat. That's warming the planet and wreaking havoc all over the world. We're not just talking polar bears here -- amphibians, oceans, everything is affected.  By food, he's referring to the fact that humans have plowed up or otherwise altered about 40% of the Earth's surface, he said, for agricultural production, much of it for livestock. Some biologists think we have to set aside huge chunks of land -- 50% of the Earth, according to Harvard University's E.O. Wilson -- to stop the sixth extinction from occurring, or to lessen its scope.  Add the population boom to this and you can see why farms are going to be a big issue this century.  Finally, money. That means poaching -- illegal networks are decimating the populations of some animals, including elephants, rhinos and the pangolin. And it means thinking of nature as an endless vat of cash.  ""How do we get off of treating nature as this bottomless checking account and begin to treat it as an investment account, where we're living off the interest?"" Barnosky asked during our interview.  I'm not sure how we'll change. But I have to hope that understanding the scope of this crisis is part of moving toward solutions. Giraffes are constricted by human development; they're poached for their tails, which are used as bracelets, and for their meat, according to the African Wildlife Foundation. We shouldn't see the giraffe's plight as an isolated crisis. Humans are reshaping the face of Earth as never before. It happens in slow motion, making us easily distracted from the cumulative destruction one generation passes to the next. And many of us are so disconnected from nature -- we see it through car windows, from the suburbs, on safari -- that we don't realize the scope of our responsibility in this collapse.  Imagine a world without giraffes.  In the long term, without big changes, that's what we reasonably can expect.  ",3.5
890029,Corey Feldman's Alleged Attack Motivated by Road Rage: Lawyer,"Corey Feldman‘s alleged attacked was motivated by road rage, his attorney tells PEOPLE. “It was on Ventura Blvd., it’s kind of a place where people cruise,” Feldman’s lawyer, Perry Wander, says. “I think it was an ego thing. They got into a staring contest with the security guard. It was road rage. At the light, one of the guys got out of the car and the security guard, instead of just taking off, stupidly got out of the car and engaged with them. While he was distracted, one of the [alleged attackers] circled around and opened the door and caught Corey by surprise and attacked him with a sharp object.” The Blast first reported about the road rage allegation. As for allegations that Feldman is paranoid, his lawyer said, “There’s a lot of people trolling him on social media that have made threats to him. He has a genuine concern that I believe is well founded that certain people are upset with him about him outing child molesters.” (In his 2013 memoir, Coreyography, Feldman claimed that he and his best friend at the time, fellow child actor Corey Haim, had been sexually abused by people in the industry. Haim died of pneumonia in 2010 at just 38.) Feldman, 46, shared two photos of himself lying in a hospital bed Wednesday morning. He claimed three men approached him in his car and one attacked while his security was distracted. “IM IN THE HOSPITAL! I WAS ATTACKED 2NITE!” he wrote. “A MAN OPENED MY CAR DOOR & STABBED ME W SOMETHING! PLEASE SAY PRAYERS 4 US!  THANK GOD IT WAS ONLY MYSELF & MY SECURITY IN THE CAR, WHEN 3 MEN APPROACHED! WHILE SECURITY WAS DISTRACTED, W A GUY A CAR PULLED UP & ATTACKED! I’M OK!” “@LAPD CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING THE CASE AS AN ATTEMPTED HOMICIDE! I HAVE HAD MOUNTING THREATS ON ALL [SOCIAL MEDIA] PLATFORMS BY THIS VILE ‘WOLFPACK’ & THIS IM SURE IS A RESULT OF THOSE NEGATIVE ACTIONS!” he said. “I HAVE REASON 2 BELIEVE ITS ALL CONNECTED! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! HOW SICK R THESE PPL?!?” Though Feldman’s attorney insists this was not a planned attack, his rep said that he receives threats often. “The ‘wolfpack’ make videos everyday threatening and bashing him and while we don’t have proof that they were involved, he was terrified and didn’t know what hit him,” said the rep, who claimed that Feldman does have a laceration on his stomach despite conflicting reports. “The attackers didn’t ask for his wallet or take his car. It was very quick. He didn’t recognize them.” LAPD spokeswoman Officer Rosario Herrera previously told PEOPLE there is “no suspect at this time and the investigation is ongoing.” Although he has been outspoken about the trauma he claims he and Haim faced during their rise as heartthrobs in the late 1980s, Feldman said there is still more to the story. Last fall, he launched a fundraising campaign hoping to crowd fund $10 million in two months in order to make a movie about his life and bring his alleged Hollywood abusers to justice. The number was later adjusted to $1 million, and Feldman has since launched a second campaign on a different fundraising platform, hoping to raise $100,000. During an appearance on Megyn Kelly Today in October, Feldman said he was “fearing for [his] life” and alleged someone had recently tried to kill him before backtracking slightly. “I had two trucks come speeding at me on the highway at the same time,” he said. “I was with six other people. I have many witnesses to this. I’m not saying they were trying to kill Corey Feldman, but they were definitely trying to kill a group of people walking across the street.”",3.5
892659,Tower of Power band members hit by train in Oakland," (CNN)Two members of the funk-rock band Tower of Power are recovering after being hit by a train, the group's representative said. ""In an unfortunate accident...drummer David Garibaldi and current bassist Marc van Wageningen were struck by a train in California,"" said their PR agent Jeremy Westby in a statement to CNN. Both men are responsive and being treated at a hospital, according to Westby.   CNN affiliate KRON reports that the accident happened while the men were walking in Jack London Square, near the concert venue in the Embarcadero area of Oakland.  The Oakland Fire Department said ""multiple pedestrians hit by train,"" in a tweet and that two ambulances were requested. Garibaldi and Wageningen were not in the designated crosswalk when they were hit, an Amtrak spokesperson told CNN Affiliate KGO.  The band was scheduled to perform Thursday night at Yoshi's music venue in Oakland. Their two concerts have been canceled according to the club's website. A video posted on the band's Facebook page showed Tower of Power performing at Yoshi's earlier this week.  The Oakland-based Tower of Power was founded in 1968 and its horn driven sound has been featured on songs by Elton John, Santana, Rod Stewart and Aerosmith.  Their own hits include songs such as ""You're Still a Young Man"" and ""What is Hip."" CNN's Tina Burnside, Judy Oehling and Andy Rose contributed to this report. ",4.0

894909,World number one Osaka signs with Nike,"TOKYO (Reuters) - World number one Naomi Osaka has agreed a deal with Nike, the sports apparel giant has announced. The Japanese, who had previously been tied to rival Adidas, will first wear Nike gear at the Stuttgart Grand Prix later this month, the U.S. sportswear maker said on its website. “I’m proud to become a member of the Nike family and excited about getting involved in all of the opportunities Nike has to offer,” said Osaka in the statement. “Nike has a legendary track record of writing history and I look forward to being a part of those moments for many years to come.” The Japanese has won the last two Grand Slams, having become the first ever Japanese player to win one of the four majors when she overcame Serena Williams at the U.S. Open in September. “Naomi is an incredible talent to add to our roster and help drive our commitment to inspiring a new generation of female athletes,” Nike VP Amy Montagne added in the statement. “We are thrilled to have her join our team.” Osaka’s ascent to the top of the women’s game has made her a hot marketable commodity for the world’s top brands. She already has deals with Japanese airline All Nippon Airways, car manufacturer Nissan and watch company Citizen, amongst others. Reporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty",3.5
901806,London shows the challenge of preventing low-tech terror,"Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of ""United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists."" This story has been updated to reflect the latest number of fatalities from London Metropolitan Police.  (CNN)It's a depressingly familiar tale. A vehicle slams into a group of pedestrians in a Western city and the terrorist driving the car then uses a knife to inflict further damage and is soon shot by police.  This time it was Wednesday's attack outside one of the most iconic buildings in the world, the Houses of Parliament in London. Four victims and the attacker are dead and there are at least 40 injuries. It's the most lethal terrorist attack in the United Kingdom since al Qaeda directed four suicide attackers who killed 52 commuters on the London transportation system on July 7, 2005. The Parliament attack is just one in a series of such relatively low-tech -- and hard to defend against -- terrorist attacks in the West over the past three years that have typically been inspired by ISIS, and occasionally also inspired by Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born al Qaeda cleric. On November 28, 2016, Abdul Razak Ali Artan, an 18-year-old legal resident of the United States whose family was originally from Somalia, used a car to mow down a group of people at the Ohio State University. Artan then attacked the crowd with a knife. He injured 11 people before he was killed by a police officer. In a message that Artan had posted on Facebook just before the attack, he told readers to ""listen ... to our hero Imam Anwar al-Awlaki."" Awlaki is a cleric prominent in al Qaeda who was killed by a CIA drone strike in Yemen in 2011. A month after the Ohio State attack, 12 people were killed when a large truck plowed into a crowd at a Berlin Christmas market. The attack was carried out by what ISIS termed ""a soldier of the Islamic State."" This formulation didn't mean that ISIS had any direct role in the Berlin attack, only that ISIS had inspired it. Similarly, during Bastille Day celebrations in Nice, France on July 14, 2016, Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel killed 84 using a large truck as a weapon. ISIS claimed that the Nice attack was carried out by one of its ""soldiers,"" though French authorities said Bouhlel had no formal links to the group. On October 20, 2014 Canadian Martin Rouleau Couture, an ISIS sympathizer, ran over two soldiers in Quebec with a vehicle, killing one and injuring another. Using vehicles as weapons is a tactic that has often used by Palestinian terrorists to target Israelis, but in 2014 an ISIS spokesman had encouraged such vehicular attacks in the West, saying of ISIS' enemies, ""Run him over with your car."" In 2013, two terrorists mowed down British soldier Lee Rigby with a car as he was walking down a street in London and then hacked him to death. In court, one of the terrorists described al Qaeda as ""brothers in Islam."" Three years earlier, al Qaeda's Yemeni branch had encouraged its recruits in the West in its webzine, Inspire, to use vehicles as a weapon. An Inspire article headlined ""The Ultimate Mowing Machine"" called for using a vehicle as a ""mowing machine, not to mow grass but mow down the enemies of Allah."" These attacks are hard to defend against in free societies where crowds will gather, as was the case for Bastille Day in Nice, or the Christmas market in Berlin, or students attending Ohio State -- and now the throngs of tourists and visitors that typically crowd the sidewalks around the Houses of Parliament. Of course, Western countries cannot turn all of their heavily trafficked pedestrian areas into zones of walls and barriers, but law enforcement needs to have a deep understanding of who may be radicalizing before they carry out a lethal terrorist attack. This is not an easy task, as some ISIS-inspired terrorists are radicalizing quite quickly before they take action. According to an unpublished FBI study of 80 terrorist attacks and plots in the United States since 2009, those who typically have the most useful information about radicalization and potential acts of violence are peers and family members.  Enlisting the help of peers or family members is the best defense against the kind of attack we saw in London on Wednesday. ",4.5
906368,Leaked pics show Google's new pricey Chromebook 'Pixelbook' and stylus,"It looks like yet another big Google rumor has been confirmed. Images of what is reportedly a brand new Pixel-branded Chromebook have just surfaced, thanks to a fresh crop of leaks from DroidLife. The Android blog is reporting that Google is gearing up to launch a new high-end Chromebook, called ""Pixelbook,"" that could rival Apple's iPad Pro. The so-called ""Pixelbook"" will essentially be a silver Chromebook that can also fold into a tablet and comes with an optional pressure-sensitive stylus. It's not clear who the manufacturer of the device is, but the Pixelbook images look a lot like the previous Chromebook Pixel, though the hinge will now allow for it to be used as a tablet as well. Google is apparently targeting the high-end consumer for this device. It's the first Chromebook to carry the Pixel moniker since the 2015 Chromebook Pixel, and it will reportedly start at a price of $1,200. Google Pixelbook is Google’s New Chromebook With Pixelbook Pen, Starting at $1,199.https://t.co/hxtalQXdwT pic.twitter.com/jzKB1I5OsY — Droid Life (@droid_life) September 19, 2017 That price is for the entry-level 128GB model. Google will also sell a 256GB version for $1,400, and 512Gb option for $1,750. The Pixelbook's pressure-sensitive ""Pixelbook Pen"" stylus will reportedly cost $100. Other news outlets had reported the existence of a Pixel-branded Chromebook last month, but details around the device remained murky. Now, between the stylus, tablet functionality, and price tag, it seems pretty clear Google will be positioning the Pixelbook as a high-end Chromebook more along the lines of what you'd expect from the iPad Pro than the typical low-cost Chromebook. The Pixelbook is expected to launch alongside Google's Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL phones at an October 4th press event in San Francisco. It's not clear when it will go on sale. ",4.0

915254,Four killed in Togo as protesters clash with security forces,"LOME (Reuters) - Four people were killed in Togo on Wednesday in clashes between security forces and demonstrators calling for an end to a half century of Gnassingbe family rule, the security minister said. Opposition activists have been demonstrating since August against Gnassingbe’s administration and say a constitutional reform he has proposed would allow him to rule the West African country until 2030. Colonel Damehame Yark, the security and civil protection minister, told a news conference that one person was shot dead and around sixty others arrested in the capital, Lome. Another three died of gunshot wounds in the second-biggest city, Sokode. “These are too many deaths. We’d be wise to preserve the peace,” he said. The latest bout of protests followed the arrest in Sokode on Monday of a Muslim imam accused of urging his followers to murder soldiers. Clashes erupted after the arrest. A crowd killed two soldiers and one other person died in unspecified circumstances, the government said in a statement. About 20 other people were injured, it added. The deaths reignited a mass protest movement against President Faure Gnassingbe, who succeeded his late father Gnassingbe Eyadema in 2005. The protesters are calling for his resignation. “We deplore this toll and we say that backing down is out of the question. Despite what we have suffered, we will maintain our call for protests tomorrow,” said Brigitte Adjamagbo, one of the leaders of the opposition movement. She said the coalition was aware of two people killed, including an 11-year-old child, as well as twenty others who were seriously injured and dozens of arrests. In a bid to curb demonstrations, the government has banned marches and mass protests on weekdays. But young protesters in Be, a working-class neighborhood in eastern Lome, defied the ban on Wednesday. They erected barricades with bricks and burning tyres and threw stones at security forces, who responded with volleys of tear gas. “This is our last bastion,” shouted one demonstrator, Ayi Koffi. “We have no arms, no gas. We do not have cars to pick up people. We have come out barehanded to say, enough!” In a statement, the International Organisation of La Francophonie, a group comprised mainly of French-speaking countries including Paris’s former colonies, said that nothing justified the violence. “Dialogue must be prioritised in all circumstances,” it said. The controversial constitutional reform will be decided by popular referendum after the bill failed to win approval from parliament following a boycott by opposition lawmakers last month.

939654,Oscar Pistorius' sentence more than doubled; slain girlfriend's family calls it 'justice'," (CNN)Reeva Steenkamp ""can now rest in peace,"" her family said Friday, after a South African high court  more than doubled Oscar Pistorius' sentence for her killing.  The Supreme Court of Appeal increased his sentence to 13 years and five months for the murder of his girlfriend,  Steenkamp. It issued the ruling after the prosecution appealed his previous sentence of six years as too lenient. The former Olympic and Paralympic sprinter killed Steenkamp at his home in an upscale Pretoria neighborhood on Valentine's Day 2013 -- an act he says was an accident after he mistook her for an intruder. The prosecution called it a deliberate act after the two had an argument. The court's decision is ""justice for Reeva,"" her family's spokeswoman said, adding that they hope ""this is the end of the road and that everyone can move forward.""  Prosecutor Gerrie Nel argued that Pistorius' sentence was ""shockingly lenient,"" while the defense sought to dismiss the appeal.  Supreme Court Justice Willie Seriti said Pistorius failed to explain in court hearings why he fired the fatal shots and ""does not appreciate the gravity of his actions."" ""I find it difficult on the evidence to accept that the respondent is genuinely remorseful,"" Seriti wrote in his decision.  Seriti said the facts of the case demanded a higher sentence.  ""The sentence of six years' imprisonment is shockingly lenient to a point where it has the effect of trivializing this serious offense,"" he added.  Pistorius can appeal the new sentence, according to Kelly Phelps, an adviser to his defense team, but no decision has been made.  The legal fight Pistorius originally was convicted of manslaughter in 2014 after months of hearings and sentenced to five years, but a higher court overturned the conviction and changed it to murder a year later. During Pistorius' sentencing for murder, the trial judge cited mitigating circumstances for a lesser punishment, saying Pistorius was genuinely remorseful and a good candidate for rehabilitation.  The minimum sentence for murder in South Africa is 15 years, but individual judges can lower the sentence if there are ""substantial and compelling"" reasons to do so.  The judge described Pistorius as a ""fallen hero"" who will never be at peace and sentenced him to six years in prison. From hero to killer The Paralympic gold medalist was known as the ""Fastest Man on No Legs,"" and his inspiring story captured fans' imagination at the 2012 London Olympics. Born with a congenital abnormality, Pistorius had both his legs amputated below the knee before his first birthday, but through sheer determination excelled in world-class athletics. In 2012, he became the first double amputee to compete against able-bodied runners at the London Olympics, adding to his fame as the ""Blade Runner,"" a reference to his carbon-fiber prosthetic legs. He failed to win a medal, but Pistorius' presence on the track was hailed as a triumph over adversity and a victory over critics who claimed his blades gave him an unfair advantage over others.

940393,Probiotics: What are the health effects?," (CNN)Probiotic supplements may be a growing trend among health-conscious consumers, but the tiny bacteria that have been stuffed into capsules and stacked on pharmacy shelves coexisted with us before we were even aware of them. These live microorganisms are akin to the valuable microorganisms already residing in our bodies, a vast ecosystem of microbial species, including bacteria and yeast.  Now that products containing probiotics are sold as yogurt, drinks and dietary supplements, there seems to be some confusion around how to define probiotics and how beneficial they really are. ""It's taken a while for the scientific community to actually form a consensus of what we mean when we say probiotics, because people might mean different things,"" said Lynne McFarland, an associate professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Washington in Seattle.  She wrote a paper on the history, development and current use of probiotics, which was published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases in 2015. ""The most recent recommendation and consensus is that they have to be alive. They can be a bacteria or a yeast. They have to be used in an adequate dose, and they have to have some proven beneficial health effect,"" McFarland said of probiotics.  ""Probiotics have been around for a long time,"" she said. ""It took a while for science to catch up with what's going on."" How has our understanding of probiotics changed over time? Here's a look at probiotics' steady rise in popularity, from Europe to America, and where health experts now stand on their benefits. Prehistory: Storing sushi in the early days of fermentation About the time our hunter-gatherer ancestors took up farming, 11,000 years ago, they started to consume probiotics without even realizing it, said Dr. Cate Shanahan, a Newtown, Connecticut-based family physician who also consults as a nutritionist with the Los Angeles Lakers. As farmers settled into communities, they developed the habit of storing more of their food. ""With anything that you store, microbes are just going to start growing in it,"" Shanahan said. This sometimes resulted in the fermentation of foods.  Fermentation, when microorganisms grow on and break down food, can make that food item rich with probiotics. The process also may increase the shelf life of a food and make some foods more digestible, Shanahan said. For instance, in Asia, sushi was originally a fermented food, Shanahan said.  ""They had so much fish that they'd catch all at once. ... So they would store it, and they discovered that packing it in rice would help store the fish so that it would basically rot, but in a way that wasn't disgusting and more controlled,"" she said. ""We now know it was because there was special bacteria, called Bacillus bacteria, in the rice that was helping out."" In other words, the bacteria in the rice helped store the fish. Around the same time, many other examples of fermentation were emerging in other parts of the world. Some research suggests that ancient Egyptians fermented their beverages through complex brewing methods. ""They have the hieroglyphics of the pharaoh being served something in a bowl, and people who have translated those have gone, 'OK, this is sort of a fermented milk product,' "" McFarland said.  As agriculture expanded, so did our relationship with probiotics. 13th century: Did Marco Polo drink kefir? Marco Polo, the Venetian merchant traveler who ventured across Asia, was known to speak of probiotic-rich fermented beverages such as kefir in his travels. It is believed that when nomadic shepherds and travelers journeyed with raw milk carried in leather, the milk would accidentally ferment over time. Some studies suggest that this process led to the creation of kefir, a fermented milk drink that originated in the Caucasus Mountains.  It's believed that the word kefir derives from the Turkish word keyif, meaning ""pleasure"" or ""feeling good"" after its ingestion. The beneficial health properties of kefir and other dairy products were a part of folklore until the idea of probiotics arose. 19th-20th centuries: The 'father of probiotics' In the late 1800s, French biologist Louis Pasteur identified the bacteria and yeasts responsible for the process of fermentation, but it was Russian biologist Elie Metchnikoff who linked those microorganisms to health outcomes. Metchnikoff had long theorized that the microorganisms in our guts could have beneficial or adverse effects on our health. In 1905, Metchnikoff studied how many residents of poor communities in Eastern Europe were centenarians, living to be 100 or older. He associated their longevity with the type of bacteria used to ferment the yogurt they would eat, and he became known as the ""father of probiotics.""  ""He's the first one who published a book looking at Bulgarians and saying, 'Gosh, they live longer,' and it wasn't due to their diet. It wasn't due to the yogurt that they consumed but actually the bacteria that was used to ferment the yogurt,"" McFarland said. ""That clever Russian. ... He's the one who kind of went, 'You know, bacteria aren't all bad.' "" In 1908, Metchnikoff shared a Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine with German physician Paul Ehrlich for their research on the immune system.  Many other scientists followed Metchnikoff's research efforts into the bizarre micro-world of bacteria, including Henry Tissier, a French pediatrician who discovered ""good"" bacteria called Bifidobacterium in the guts of infants. He proposed that the bacteria could be used to treat patients with diarrhea. However, the concept of probiotics quietly drifted to the background of medical focus until it re-emerged in the mid-1950s in Europe. ""They were always more popular in Scandinavia and Europe,"" McFarland said. 1950s-1980s: Making a name for probiotics in Europe In 1953, German bacteriologist Werner Kollath first used ""probiotic"" to describe various supplements believed to restore the health of malnourished patients. The term was derived from Latin and Greek, meaning ""for life."" In the next year, German scientist Ferdinand Vergin used the term to describe ""active substances"" beneficial for health. Then, in 1965, a paper in the journal Science used the term probiotics to describe substances produced by one microorganism that stimulate the growth of another. In 1974, a paper published in the journal Animal Nutrition Health used the term probiotics in the context in which we use it today, to ""contribute to intestinal microbial balance.""  Then, in 1989, Roy Fuller, a researcher of gut microbial ecology, redefined probiotics as ""a live microbial feed supplement, which beneficially affects the host animal."" In the United States, however, there was less attention on probiotics and more attention on antibiotics. ""Antibiotics were seen as only beneficial. In the '70s, actually, doctors would just treat people with anything with a shot, like they didn't have any clue about resistance or any clue about side effects,"" Shanahan said. ""About the late '80s, early '90s, we started to understand antibiotics had a downside,"" she said, such as leading to antibiotic resistance and killing off beneficial bacteria. Meanwhile, Americans started to understand probiotics. 1990s: Probiotic popularity spreads across US ""I started doing this research back in the 1990s, and it was very infrequent that somebody in the US would know what we were talking about when we would talk about probiotics,"" McFarland said. ""It really wasn't until 1994, when the dietary health and supplement law was enacted, that allowed these kinds of products to be sold over the counter,"" she said. ""Suddenly ... people became very aware of what it is. It's truly amazing how quickly the popularity of this spread."" In 1994, the US Food and Drug Administration implemented the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, which allowed dietary supplements to be regulated under a different set of rules than prescription drugs, foods and beverages. ""What changed is that before that law became enacted, probiotics were considered an investigational drug. So it was going through the FDA process, and we had to go through ... very long and expensive drug pathway development through the FDA,"" McFarland said. ""Then, when the dietary supplement law got enacted ... it opened a floodgate of quote-unquote probiotic products that weren't really probiotic, and the quality of the products were not as regulated as they should have been, having not gone through the ordinary FDA process,"" she said. ""I think that's still the situation today."" 2000s: Health officials crack down on probiotics In 2002, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization drafted guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics in food in a joint consultation. The guidelines recommended that the definition of probiotics be ""live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host."" Around this time, various ways to administer probiotics and prebiotics, which promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut, emerged, McFarland said. ""There's now probiotics that come in chocolate; probiotics come in cheese; there's bread. Little sprinkles you can put on ice cream,"" she said. Next, scientists started to research how probiotics may benefit your health, specifically your gut.  2010: A spotlight on the gut Studies suggest that some probiotics might help with symptoms of certain chronic gastrointestinal tract conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome. However, such benefits have not been conclusively demonstrated, and not all probiotics have the same effects, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.  In 2010, a systematic review paper in the journal Gut found that probiotics were helpful in treating the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, compared with a placebo or no treatment. Yet the magnitude of benefit and most effective species of probiotic remained uncertain. For the paper, 18 randomized controlled trials on the effectiveness of probiotics as an irritable bowel syndrome treatment were analyzed. The trials, published between 1950 and 2008, involved 1,650 patients total.  ""This systematic review indicates that probiotics have a therapeutic benefit in improving IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) symptoms,"" the researchers wrote. ""Future studies need to establish which species, strain and dose of probiotics are most efficacious in IBS."" 2010s: His and hers probiotics emerge By 2012, the use of probiotics had skyrocketed in popularity in the US, with nearly 3 million more adults using probiotics or prebiotics than in 2007, when only about 865,000 adults used such supplements.  Among American adults, probiotics ranked as the third most commonly used dietary supplement behind fish oil, and glucosamine and chondroitin, according to a 2015 National Health Statistics Report. Additionally, ""there's been a big thing on 'this is a women's probiotic' or 'this is a men's probiotic.' There has been a big thing on gender probiotics,"" McFarland said of one emerging trend.  However, she added that there is no difference between a male or female microbiome, and therefore, there should be no difference in how a probiotic would benefit a man or a woman -- that is, outside of vaginal health. ""The only difference is that there are some probiotic strains that are good for vaginitis, so if they're trying to say 'restores vaginal health,' then that might be OK as a woman's product,"" McFarland said.  ""The thing to remember is that your vagina is a very acidic environment, and it's colonized with lactobacillus,"" she said. ""There's only a couple strains that have been shown to be really good -- Lactobacillus reuteri and rhamnosus -- and others have been tried but haven't really been that effective."" All in all, McFarland said, probiotics may be beneficial if taken to prevent travel-associated diarrhea or to prevent side effects of antibiotics. For any other purposes, however, she recommended consulting with your doctor or checking scientific literature for guidance. ""What we're finding is that a person has their own profile of their microbiome. If that's disrupted, and even if you take probiotics, after you stop taking probiotics, it goes back to what your profile was before,"" McFarland said.  ""So, it's like it remembers who's invited to the party, and it only invites those people,"" she said. ""I think it's still an exciting field for research because, the more we appreciate how much bacteria do for us, the more we appreciate what happens when it gets disrupted."" Shanahan recommends going old-school. ""From my perspective, the more logical thing to do is to eat foods that are good for us and that bacteria can utilize as well,"" Shanahan said. ""I get foods rich in prebiotics and ready-to-eat fermented foods. I'll eat yogurt or kimchi, and for prebiotics to feed the probiotics, I make sure I always get some kind of fiber-y thing, whether it's nuts or vegetables or beans,"" she said. ""But the probiotic-rich foods, which are the fermented and cultured foods, are more likely to be beneficial than supplements."" 2017: Probiotic studies on sepsis and sore throats A combination of the right probiotics with a prebiotic were found to be effective in preventing sepsis in babies in rural India in a large randomized, controlled trial, the results of which were published in the journal Nature in August. The first-of-its-kind study suggests that taking a capsule of the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum plus the prebiotic fructooligosaccharide is associated with a significant 40% reduction in an infant's risk of neonatal sepsis and subsequent death. About 1 million neonatal deaths each year are related to neonatal sepsis, a blood infection that can occur in an infant younger than 90 days. Babies with signs of sepsis are typically treated with antibiotics, administered intravenously. However, the new study explored preventing infections to begin with using orally administered probiotics combined with a prebiotic, called a synbiotic.  The study involved 4,556 infants with no signs of sepsis in Odisha, India, where neonatal and infant mortality rates are among the highest in India, the researchers noted in the study. The researchers monitored the health of the infants for their first 60 days of life while half of the infants were given the synbiotic and the others were given a placebo. Those in the synbiotic group were given the synbiotic orally for seven days, beginning between their second to fourth day of life. Among the infants, the researchers observed a reduction in neonatal sepsis between the groups: Nine percent in the placebo group developed sepsis, compared with 5.4% in the synbiotic group. ""These findings suggest that a large proportion of neonatal sepsis in developing countries could be effectively prevented using a synbiotic containing L. plantarum,"" the researchers wrote in the study. On the other hand, neither probiotic capsules nor xylitol-based chewing gum was effective in reducing the severity of sore throat symptoms, such as swelling or difficulty swallowing, according to a study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal in December of 2017. The study involved 689 patients, ages 3 and older, who were in primary care for pharyngitis or sore throat. The patients recorded in diaries the numbers of probiotic capsules and pieces of gum used each day, with some being assigned to take probiotics or use gum, and others not. ""This is one of the few studies to address the effectiveness of two promising over-the-counter remedies for acute pharyngitis. The results show that neither probiotics nor xylitol is likely to have a meaningful effect,"" the researchers wrote in the study. ",4.0
945615,White House re-nominates McFarland despite Democrats' warnings,"Washington (CNN)The White House decided to re-nominate a former deputy national security adviser for an administrative post despite warnings from Democrats they are unlikely to support her amid questions about previous congressional testimony. On Monday, the White House re-submitted dozens of names to the Senate for administration posts after their nominations expired at the end of last year. Included in the slate: K.T. McFarland, the national security pundit and one-time deputy national security adviser who President Donald Trump tapped to become the US ambassador to Singapore. Last month questions were raised about whether McFarland properly disclosed to Congress her communications with former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. Flynn's plea agreement appeared to be at odds with McFarland's testimony to Congress, during which she said she wasn't aware of Flynn's contacts with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. While McFarland was not mentioned in the Flynn court filings, sources confirmed that she was the transition official who spoke to Flynn. Moreover, a New York Times report revealed that McFarland mentioned Flynn's communications with the Russian ambassador in a separate email on December 29. In her testimony on Capitol Hill last year, McFarland did not disclose those conversations, despite being asked directly in written correspondence with Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey. ""Did you ever discuss any of Gen. Flynn's contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak directly with General Flynn?"" Booker wrote to McFarland in July. McFarland responded: ""I am not aware of any of the issues or events as described above."" If McFarland's nomination is to move forward, she'll likely be required to answer questions about her contacts with Flynn surrounding the Russia phone calls. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, whose committee oversees the McFarland nomination, told CNN in December that Democrats had already expressed concerns over McFarland's nomination. ""Nominees that have other productive lives they can lead probably have to assess themselves whether it makes a lot of sense to continue on because it does put your life on hold,"" the Tennessee Republican said. ""Before any of these other things came out, there were significant Democratic objections to this nominee -- the nominee is aware of that. This obviously makes it more difficult."" McFarland was one of 76 names the White House resent to the Senate on Monday after their nominations expired. Trump has accused Democrats of stonewalling his nominees. They include Alex Azar, Trump's nominee to become secretary of Health and Human Services; James Bridenstine, his choice to lead NASA; Ricahrd Grenell, the conservative activist chosen as ambassador to Germany; Jerome Powell, Trump's Federal Reserve chairman nominee; and Sam Brownback, the former Kansas governor tapped to serve as ambassador at large for religious freedom. The list also includes several judicial picks and top ranking officials at Cabinet agencies. ",4.0

946635,'Swatting' suspect faces manslaughter charge in fatal shooting by police," (CNN)The California man accused of initiating a ""swatting"" incident that ended in a Kansas man's death has been charged with involuntary manslaughter. Tyler Barriss, 25, made his first appearance Friday in a Wichita, Kansas, courtroom after being extradited from California. He also faces charges of giving false alarm and interference with a law enforcement officer. A judge set his bond at $500,000.  ""Swatting"" -- a prank that dates at least to the early 2000s -- occurs when someone makes a false police report in an attempt to lure law enforcement agents to the location of the prank's target.   Barriss was arrested last month in Los Angeles after allegedly making a false call to police that led them to the home of Andrew Finch in Wichita on December 28. Authorities shot Finch when he opened the front door of his home, and he later died at the hospital. The investigation into Barriss' actions remains ongoing, according to Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett. His next court appearance will be January 25. Prankster's call blamed It appears Finch's ""swatting"" death began with a prank stemming from an online multiplayer session of the video game ""Call of Duty: WWII.""  One member of the gaming community told CNN that Barriss was asked by a gamer to swat another after an argument during a ""Call of Duty"" match. The source did not want to give his name for fear of reprisal from the gaming community. Finch died after police responded to a false report of a domestic shooting and hostage situation. Authorities were led to Finch's family home, where the 28-year-old was shot when he opened the front door. One officer fired his weapon when Finch moved his hands to his waistline, Wichita police Deputy Chief Troy Livingston said.  It remains unclear why Finch's address was the one provided to police. Finch didn't even play video games, according to his family.  Earlier arrest for swatting Barriss apparently left a digital trail that suggests he was familiar with swatting. One of his Twitter handles was @SWAuTistic, and one person who knew Barriss through the online gaming community told CNN, ""He's a grown man who's done this stuff before.""  Another said Barriss ""was known in the gaming community for doing stuff like that."" Barriss was arrested in 2015 for calling in fake bomb threats to CNN affiliate KABC, Glendale police Sgt, Victor Jackson said. He received a two-year sentence. Celebrities are often the victims of swatting pranks. Tom Cruise, Kim Kardashian, Ashton Kutcher and Justin Bieber are among those targeted in pranks in California.

955865,Senior adviser at HUD spread conspiracy theory that Clinton campaign chairman was Satanist," (CNN)A senior adviser at the Department of Housing and Urban Development spread a false conspiracy theory that claimed Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign chairman took part in a Satanic ritual, a CNN KFile review of his tweets show. John Gibbs is a former conservative commentator who initially joined the HUD as the director for Strong Cities and Strong Communities, a program aimed at spurring economic development at the local level.  In August of 2017, Gibbs, a political appointee, transitioned to the role of senior adviser, working in the office of the assistant secretary for community planning and development. In his current role, Gibbs is tasked with developing and implementing efforts aimed at increasing economic development programs for low-income people. On Twitter, Gibbs made multiple references to a conspiracy theory started by far-right bloggers claiming Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta took part in a Satanic ritual. Tweets from Gibbs, archived on the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, show him promoting the conspiracy four times between October 31 and November 5 of 2016, using the hashtag #SpiritCooking. The hashtag originated from an email of Podesta's released by WikiLeaks, which members of the far-right claimed, without evidence, that Podesta was involved in a Satanic ritual that involved bodily fluids. The claim has repeatedly been debunked. A spokesman for the department declined to comment, saying the agency doesn't weigh in on comments not made as a public official. Gibbs did not return a request for comment.  Gibbs' Twitter page is now set to private, which means the general public can't see his full history of tweets. Tweets archived on the Wayback Machine only offer a small window into his Twitter activity.  When radio host Wayne Dupree, who is known for spreading a conspiracy theory that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax, tweeted that Clinton was losing black voters' support because her campaign manager took part in ""Satanic #SpiritCooking,"" Gibbs quote tweeted him, writing, ""True, true, and true. #Trump #SpiritCooking #BlackLivesMatter."" In another tweet, Gibbs targeted artist Marina Abramovic, whom bloggers claimed was part of the conspiracy, writing, ""Marina Abramovic, woman at the center of #SpiritCooking scandal, has a Twitter handle that ends in 666. You can't make this stuff up."" In tweets from early 2016, Gibbs also blasted ""cucks,"" a derogatory term used by the alt-right to insult establishment conservatives, and derided the Democratic Party for accepting Islam.  When far-right commentator Milo Yiannopoulos was facing backlash for comments he made endorsing sex between young boys and older men, Gibbs called the comment ""indefensible,"" but added the controversy might ""tame his ego a bit, and helps focus his outrageousness on leftists & cucks, not the good guys."" In another tweet from October 2016, Gibbs also defended Ricky Vaughn, an alt-right figure who often tweeted anti-Semitic sentiments, when Twitter banned Vaughn, an anonymous user, from the platform.    ""#Twitter down big today because they banned Ricky? #FreeRicky,"" he wrote.

The three men had plotted to blow up the complex that also contained a mosque, where the immigrants lived and worshiped, according to the Department of Justice.  Patrick Eugene Stein, 49, of Kansas, Curtis Allen, 50, of Kansas, and Gavin Wright, 49, of Oklahoma, were convicted on one count of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and one count of conspiracy to violate the housing rights of their intended victims. In addition, Wright was also convicted of lying to the FBI. The three men had ""expressed hatred for the Somali immigrants, and Muslims in general and described in the most extreme and violent terms what they planned to do to them,"" said US Attorney Stephen McAllister in a news briefing Wednesday.  During the trial, prosecutors said the men referred to Muslims as cockroaches and began plotting an attack after the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting, reported CNN affiliate KCWH.  They conspired to build and detonate a weapon of mass destruction, and chose the apartment complex in Garden City, Kansas, partly because it contained a mosque, McAllister said.  About 120 Somali immigrants live there, as many have been drawn to the city because of jobs in the meatpacking industry, reported CNN affiliate KSNW.  The three defendants held several meetings to discuss their plan, and the FBI was tipped off by a confidential source who recorded some of their conversations. They were members of a militia group, calling itself The Crusaders and sought to ""wake people up,"" the DOJ said at the time they were charged in 2016.  ""The defendants discussed among other plans, obtaining vehicles, filling them with explosives and parking them at the four corners of the apartment complex to create an explosion that would bring down and level the entire complex,"" McAllister said.  They downloaded instructions for making homemade explosives and also tested them, he said.  But defense attorneys argued that the men's discussions hadn't been that serious and questioned the credibility of the paid informant used by the FBI. The lawyers also said the defendants had a right to free speech, reported KSNW.  During the eight-month investigation, the FBI introduced an undercover agent posing as a black market arms dealer. That agent received 300 pounds of fertilizer for use in constructing a bomb from Stein and was also taken to see the building they were targeting, according to prosecutors.  ""The Department of Justice is resolute every day in fighting terrorist threats to the United States, both foreign and domestic,"" said Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a statement. ""The defendants in this case acted with clear premeditation in an attempt to kill people on the basis of their religion and national origin. That's not just illegal -- it's immoral and unacceptable, and we're not going to stand for it."" Madihha Ahussain, special counsel for anti-Muslim bigotry for Muslim Advocates, said they were glad to learn of the convictions.  ""Nevertheless, we must not ignore the dangerous plans these men intended to carry out or the greater context in which this occurred,"" she said in a statement. ""Anti-Muslim rhetoric has led to an unprecedented spike in hate violence and mosque attacks, intense radicalization of white supremacists, and a shocking disregard for the lives of American Muslims."" The three men were indicted in October 2016 and their trial lasted four weeks. They will be sentenced June 27 and could face up to life in prison.  CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report. ",3.0
959972,Scott Pruitt's actions subject of EPA inspector general reviews,"Washington (CNN)The EPA inspector general is looking into embattled Administrator Scott Pruitt's $50-per-night apartment rental, travel expenses, security team, controversial raises for staff, use of subordinates' time and staff reassignments that some have said were retribution. The litany of ethics reviews were detailed in a letter to Democratic Reps. Ted Lieu of California and Don Beyer of Virginia, which noted that some of the matters may already be under review as part of other inspector general investigations into Pruitt's behavior while atop the agency. Some matters will be looked at as part of ongoing reviews, while others ""will be the impetus for new reviews,"" the letter tells lawmakers. Pruitt has been under scrutiny for numerous actions that have called his ethics into question, including renting a room in a Washington, DC, condo for under market price from a lobbyist whose husband worked for a firm that has lobbied on energy issues. Pruitt has also been questioned for his use of 24-hour security on vacations and for traveling first class.  CNN also previously reported that several EPA employees who attempted to raise flags regarding Pruitt's spending had been sidelined or demoted.  Some lawmakers have called on Pruitt to step down from his post as several ongoing probes are looking into his actions and spending, including one by the White House. The House Oversight Committee is also looking into Pruitt.  ""I would be shocked if that many people knew who Scott Pruitt was,"" Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy of South Carolina said last week. So the notion that I have to fly first class because I don't want people to be mean to me -- you need to go into another line of work if you don't want people to be mean to you, like maybe a monk where you don't come in contact with anyone.""

969929,"Putin: 'Ready' to go to Washington, invites Trump to Moscow"," (CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday he is ready to go to Washington and has invited US President Donald Trump to Moscow, but there ""has to be necessary conditions.""  ""We are ready for such meetings, we are ready to invite President Trump to Moscow. He has this invitation already and I told him about it,"" said Putin, speaking at the BRICs summit in Johannesburg. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement that Trump is ""open to visiting Moscow,"" but suggested he has yet to receive a formal invitation from his Russian counterpart. ""President Trump looks forward to having President Putin to Washington after the first of the year, and he is open to visiting Moscow upon receiving a formal invitation,"" Sanders said in a statement Friday morning. But Putin's comments come days after Trump invited Putin to meet in Washington later this year, before quickly backtracking and pushing a potential meeting until next year. ""The President believes that the next bilateral meeting with President Putin should take place after the Russia witch hunt is over, so we've agreed that it will be after the first of the year,"" Trump's national security adviser John Bolton said in a statement on Wednesday. Less than a week earlier, the White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump had asked Bolton to invite Putin to Washington for a second round of meetings in Washington in the fall. The Russian President on Friday also praised Trump, saying the US President's ""great virtue is that he always wants to keep his promises to his voters."" ""You can critique him for what he does and many people do that but one thing is clear -- he is willing to fulfill his campaign promises,"" Putin said, adding that he viewed their meeting earlier this month in Helsinki, Finland, as ""useful.""

974683,President Trump warns evangelicals of 'violence' if GOP loses in the midterms," (CNN)US President Donald Trump, facing scrutiny for hush money payments to a porn star and a former Playboy model, pleaded with evangelical leaders for political help during closed-door remarks on Monday, warning of dire consequences to their congregations should Republicans lose in November's midterm elections. ""This November 6 election is very much a referendum on not only me, it's a referendum on your religion, it's a referendum on free speech and the First Amendment. It's a referendum on so much,"" Trump told the assemblage of pastors and other Christian leaders gathered in the State Dining Room, according to a recording from people in the room. ""It's not a question of like or dislike, it's a question that they will overturn everything that we've done and they will do it quickly and violently. And violently. There is violence. When you look at Antifa -- these are violent people,"" Trump said, describing what would happen should his voters fail to cast ballots. ""You have tremendous power. You were saying, in this room, you have people who preach to almost 200 million people. Depending on which Sunday we're talking about.""  Antifa -- a loose collection of anti-fascist groups who regularly stage counter-protests against white supremacists and neo-Nazis -- have emerged as an effective bogeyman for segments of the US right.  In a video released last year by the National Rifle Association (NRA), the pro-gun group used footage from street protests and occasional Antifa violence to paint all on the US left as seeking to ""bully and terrorize the law-abiding.""  Trump previously appeared to link Antifa to violence at a Charlottesville demonstration last year in which a white supremacist killed a left-wing counter protester and injured 19 others. The President later said there was ""blame on both sides.""  'Get people to support us' Evangelicals have provided a solid block of support for Trump, even amid the scandals involving alleged sexual affairs.  After news of those purported encounters emerged, his standing among white evangelicals did not slip. But inviting the leaders to the White House only days after the President was newly implicated by his longtime personal lawyer's guilty plea underscored the degree to which Trump is trying to keep his supporters on his side.  ""You have to hopefully get out and get people to support us,"" Trump said. ""If you don't, that will be the beginning of ending everything that you've gotten."" Trump will need to maintain that support if he hopes to help Republicans stay in power on Capitol Hill or win re-election himself in 2020. On Monday, he touted the steps he's taken to promote religious liberty, such as loosening restrictions on political speech from the pulpit, which previously could jeopardize religious institutions' tax-exempt status. The remarks from an attendee's recording offered a more dire view of the upcoming vote than Trump has projected in public. He often trumpets an upcoming ""red wave"" of Republican victories, downplaying suggestions that Democrats are poised to exploit his divisiveness and retake the House or Senate. Trump didn't mention a ""red wave"" on Monday, instead acknowledging that midterms often present new presidents with a turnout challenge. ""The polls might be good, but a lot of them say they are going to vote in 2020, but they're not going to vote if I'm not on a ballot,"" he said. ""I think we're doing well, I think we're popular, but there's a real question as to whether people are going to vote if I'm not on the ballot. And I'm not on the ballot."" That's a problem Trump said the evangelical leaders could help solve by galvanizing their congregations and followers to vote.  ""I just ask you to go out and make sure all of your people vote. Because if they don't -- it's November 6 -- if they don't vote, we're going to have a miserable two years and we're going to have, frankly, a very hard period of time,"" he said.  ""You're one election away from losing everything that you've gotten,"" he added. ""Little thing: Merry Christmas, right? You couldn't say 'Merry Christmas.' "" ",2.5

Pelicia E. Hall, MDOC commissioner, said in a statement Friday that she has been in contact with the FBI and the Mississippi Department of Public Safety regarding the deaths.  Earlier this week, information was released saying 12 prisoners had died while in custody. Two more inmates were added to that list Thursday and one more was added Friday, bringing the total to 15 deaths.  ""While we believe that most of the reported deaths during the month of August are from illnesses or natural causes, such as cancer and heart disease, based on available information, we are seeking assistance from others outside the department in the interest of transparency,"" Hall said in her statement.  Hall said Tuesday ""the number of deaths the department is reporting is not out of line with the number of deaths in previous months."" The latest DOC figures showed 47 inmates died in 2015, 53 died in 2014 and 71 in 2013. Hall said in a Tuesday statement that the state's inmate population -- 19,425 as of Tuesday -- comprises ""people from all walks of life and with all types of pre-existing conditions."" Reports from CNN affiliates suggest that at least one inmate did not die from natural causes. According to The Clarion-Ledger and DOC, five of the dead prisoners were from Central Mississippi Correctional Facility, three were from the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, five were from South Mississippi Correctional Institution and one was from Wilkinson County Correctional Facility. It is unknown where one of the inmates was being held.  Of the 15 inmates, one died in prison and nine died at a hospital. It is unknown where five of the prisoners died.  The cause of death for each of the 15 inmates is pending the results of an autopsy. CNN's Jamiel Lynch contributed to this report. ",3.0
979140,Sept. 11 suspects' treatment a focus in Guantanamo hearing,"FORT MEADE, Md. (Reuters) - A pre-trial hearing for five Sept. 11 suspects began on Monday at Guantanamo Bay, with prisoners’ treatment expected to be a focus of the U.S. military court sessions. Forty-two motions are scheduled for the week-long hearing at the Navy base in Cuba. They include multiple requests by defense lawyers for evidence of how the five suspects were treated at secret Central Intelligence Agency prisons. James Connell, a defense lawyer, told Judge Army Colonel James Pohl that medical records provided by the prosecution had been insufficient, lacking personal identifying information and a chronology of patient care. “This is not the way that discovery is supposed to work ... the medical records are actually extremely important,” said Connell, who represents Kuwaiti inmate Ammar al Baluchi, an alleged al Qaeda money mover. He is among five men suspected of conspiring to help hijackers slam airliners into New York’s World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field on Sept. 11, 2001. Almost 3,000 people died in the attacks. Two Guantanamo prisoners unrelated to the Sept. 11 case could testify to corroborate statements made in February by Yemeni defendant Ramzi bin al Shibh. He has accused guards of using noises and vibrations to torment him for years. Bin al Shibh’s lawyer, James Harrington, told the Associated Press last week that Abu Zubaydah, a Palestinian not seen since his CIA capture in 2002, has been called to testify about Bin al Shibh’s allegations. A Somali inmate, Guleed Hassan Ahmed, also has been called as a witness. Bin al Shibh is charged with wiring money from al Qaeda leaders to the hijackers. Prison staff have denied Bin al Shibh’s abuse allegations. The case against the five suspects has been plagued by repeated delays and is likely years from going to trial. The hearing is being held at Guantanamo Bay. It was monitored over closed-circuit television at a press room at Fort Meade, outside Washington. Editing by Ian Simpson and Sandra Maler",2.5
979216,Verst wants to be your WordPress for the mobile generation,"If you're looking to build your brand with some fresh content, your first stop may be WordPress.com or Medium, or you may choose Wix (the favorite of part-Victoria Secret model, part-coder Karlie Kloss).  CEO AJ Frank would rather you pick Verst to post, manage, and monetize your words (from anywhere including your smartphone) and really understand your audience.   Just over a year old, Verst launched several new features Wednesday that include paid subscriptions, homepage designs, a cheaper pricing tier, content migration from WordPress, and email delivery.  Frank previously worked as a senior product manager at Uber, the general manager at Vine, and in new business development at Google. So, he's quite familiar with getting people online, especially on their smartphones, to click, scroll, and watch.  While competitor sites like WordPress, Medium, Wix, and custom-made websites seem plentiful, Frank said he and his team saw a need for a mobile-focused and data-empowered solution.  ""We're a fully featured publishing platform, for professionals, not just hobbyists. We want you to own your audience — the way that you won’t on Facebook — and use Verst as your central hub,"" Frank said.   The latest update lets bloggers put some of their content behind a paywall, offering a way to making money beyond digital advertising also offered on the site. Bloggers take 90 percent of the revenue.  Verst is less of a drag and drop experience like Wix and not just a one-option only version like Medium. Instead, quite like WordPress, users can choose between a handful of design options which can then be easily altered. Unlike WordPress, Verst is well-designed and has a mobile app for publishing. ""Our number one [priority is] making it easier to use and maintain a site,"" Frank said. ""We have a mobile solution, where we want any publisher to be able to work off their phone or their tablet."" Frank didn't disclose how many users they have but pointed to some popular pages. For example, Reid Hoffman, cofounder of LinkedIn, is an advisor to the company and runs his blog with Verst. He shares some blog posts to LinkedIn too. Political pundit and activist Ian Capstick​, YouTuber Chris Klemens, and mental health app Stigma also use Verst.  What Verst can't guarantee, Frank said, is building you an audience.  While Medium has a built-in social network aspect, Verst acts simply as your landing page. It's up to you to share the page across Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, for example. Verst does help with search engine optimization to improve your Google ranking and also provides other audience insights so you can be smarter about when to post.  Of course, content hosting isn't free. Verst has been charging $29 per month for the whole experience but is also introducing a $12 per month tier.  Next up for Verst is offering more insights and tips. A mobile notification of the Verst app may suggest when would be a good time to post and maybe one day even post or share automatically.  ""We can be not only a place you can publish and view analytics but also a coach for you. The more you publish the easiest it is to build an audience,"" Frank said.   ",4.0
983945,SolarCity recuses two more board members from voting on Tesla offer,"(Reuters) - Two additional SolarCity Corp board members with ties to Elon Musk are recusing themselves from making decisions regarding Tesla Motors Inc’s offer to buy the solar power company, in a bid to alleviate corporate governance concerns surrounding a potential deal. The new recusals mean the majority of SolarCity’s board will be sitting out the decision on whether to be acquired by Tesla. Peter Rive, who is the cousin of Tesla chief executive and SolarCity chairman Musk, along with JB Straubel, chief technology officer and co-founder of Tesla, are both recusing themselves from the decision-making process, SolarCity spokesman Jonathan Bass said in a statement emailed to Reuters late on Friday. Musk, the largest shareholder in both companies, recused himself earlier from voting on the potential deal, along with Antonio Gracias who sits on both companies’ boards, and SolarCity Chief Executive Lyndon Rive, who is Musk’s cousin as well as Peter Rive’s brother. There are three remaining SolarCity board members: John Fisher and Nancy Pfund, both venture capitalists and Donald Kendall Jr., CEO of Kenmont, an investment management firm. “We’re very mindful of the need to have a process that ensures independent, objective decisions that are in the best interest of all shareholders,” SolarCity’s Bass said in the statement. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. SolarCity will form a special independent committee of the board, which will have independent counsel, Bass said. “Only board members who meet the requirements for independence will be involved in the decision-making process at SolarCity,” he added. Musk has described a tie-up between Tesla and SolarCity as a “no brainer.” The company could sell customers an electric car, a home battery and a solar system all at once, he said. But investors, including some who short the stocks, betting that shares will fall, point to the conflict of interest and the risk of uniting two money-losing companies which both regularly raise cash to support expansion. Since Tesla announced its offer to buy SolarCity in a deal worth $2.8 billion last Tuesday, analysts and investors have been concerned that the electric car firm’s growth plan carries a financial burden and additional debt it cannot afford. SolarCity shares have fallen more than 50 percent this year in a highly competitive market, fanning criticism that a Tesla deal was meant to save SolarCity. Writing by Liana B.

999880,Commerzbank helped foreign investors evade taxes -report,"FRANKFURT, May 3 (Reuters) - Germany’s Commerzbank was one of the main culprits in a widely used tax-evasion scheme that has cost Germany 5 billion euros ($5.78 billion) in taxes since 2011, according to a report by German public TV station Bayerischer Rundfunk. According to the report, foreign investors exploited a legal loophole, lending shares to German banks who paid less tax on dividend payments than the investors would have done themselves in so-called cum-cum deals. The TV station and its media partners obtained and combed through e-mails, marketing presentations, online chats and conversation notes they obtained from a whistleblower. Commerzbank acknowledged it had been trading in cum cum situations. “Our comprehensive internal systems and controls make sure that all our trades are consistent with German law,” Commerzbank said in a statement. Foreign investors, who are obliged to pay taxes of 15 percent on dividends from holdings in German equities, regularly lent their shares to German lenders like Commerzbank just ahead of the dividend due date, taking them back just days after the payments, according to the report. The German banks would receive the dividend payments and incur the taxes, but offset them, for example, with losses carried forward, effectively paying no taxes and benefiting by deducting a fee from the foreign investor before passing on the dividend.

The #SayNoToWar campaign on Twitter comes shortly before Pakistan announced that the captured Indian pilot, who was shot down over Kashmir, would be released Friday in an attempt to defuse the gravest crisis in the disputed border region in years. It is unclear who launched the hashtag on Twitter, but Kashmiri journalist Sagrika Kissu was one of the first to promote it on Tuesday, a check by CNN shows.  ""Let's trend the hashtag #SayNoToWar. We don't want more lives to be snuffed out. We want peace. War has never solved any problem. It never will. Thanks,"" she wrote on Tuesday. After being picked up by celebrities from both countries, politicians, rights group and common users, the hashtag began trending worldwide and was among the top trends in India and Pakistan before becoming a Twitter moment.  The Dataminr social discovery platforms shows that more than 128,500 tweets were published using the hashtag in the past two days, with peaks of 2,000 tweets every 10 minutes on Wednesday at noon, CNN analysis shows.  Kissu, who belongs to the Kashmiri Pandit minority, told CNN her family migrated from Kashmir to Jammu in 1991 because of the insurgency in the region.  ""I have grown up listening to the stories of Exodus and conflict. And it is etched inside of my mind and heart,"" she said. ""Now, when we are on the brink of having a war there are people who are promoting war in the name of nationalism, which is purely jingoistic.""  She said she pushed the hashtag on Twitter in an attempt to help break the cycle of violence and war before it's too late: ""Soldiers and innocent civilians on both sides will die at the border. War will only lead to destruction. India and Pakistan need to heal their injured egos and sit down and talk."" Both Indians and Pakistanis used #SayNoToWar to make a pledge, including actors and politicians.  One of the most prolific tweeters on the issue was Bollywood singer Vishal Dadlani, who retweeted Pakistani political activists Tooba Syed's post:  British MP Yasmin Qureshi and Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai also shared the campaign with messages of peace.  Kissu said that besides a few trolls the overwhelming response was very positive, particularly from young people.  ""People were very receptive,"" she said. ""The hashtag took life of its own because of the people responded positively, especially the youth. And that was the heartwarming moment.  ""Never thought Twitter can make such a huge difference.""

1012576,Hyperloop One shows first photos of its desert test loop," They're building a tube in the desert. After some delays, lots of controversy and maybe a little concern about the longevity of the enterprise, HyperLoop One, the next-gen transportation company, is building a full-scale test track (test tube?) in the Nevada desert. Unveiled at Dubai's Middle East Rail Conference, the images and video show 50 meters of white 3.3 meter-in-diameter metal tubing connected end-to-end. Hyperloop One calls the test track DevLoop.  So far,  there's 500 meters of tubing, weighing over 1,100 tons. When the DevLoop is completed, it will form a loop in the desert, roughly 30 miles outside of Las Vegas, where HyperLoop One hopes to conduct its first full-scale test of what would be the World's first hyperloop transportation system. That system was first envisioned by SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in 2013. It's a ground-based transportation technology that uses vacuum-sealed tubes, maglev, frictionless propulsion technology and sealed pods inside the tubes that cruse along at just-below the speed of sound. When completed, such a transportation system could cut hours-long travel between cities down to minutes.  Tube work looks a little like tunnel work. Hyperloop One hopes to conduct its first DevLoop run in the first half of 2017. However, the first Hyperloop One system probably won't be in the U.S. The company signed an agreement late last year with Dubai and the United Arab Emirates to conduct a feasibility study. In January, Hyperloop One CEO Rob Lloyd told Mashable that it's feasible that Dubai will get the first Hyperloop. Comments Lloyd made at the Middle East Conference, according to a release provided by the company, seem to support that possibility: ""Tying together the Middle East region would produce greater virtual density, without congestion and pollution, spurring innovation, productivity, job growth and more powerful sharing of knowledge, labor and investment. Building a Hyperloop would vastly impact the economy and make any major city in the GCC accessible within one hour.""  Even as it finally makes progress, Hyperloop One faces increasing competition from Hyperloop Technologies and even a startup from their former co-founder and CTO Brogan BamBrogan. Still, Hyperloop One is the only company to successfully demonstrate any portion of a hyperloop system and this DevLoop build out in the Nevada dessert represents a significant leap forward. Soon, all the hyperloops out there may be playing catch-up. ",3.0

Jiangming Liu, who works for PIPA in China, said the company was expecting Armando to fetch a high price but ""multiple times less"" than what he actually got. ""We're all surprised,"" Liu said.  PIPA said Armando is the most expensive bird ever to be sold at auction by a huge margin. The next most expensive is believed to be a bird called Nadine, which fetched more than $450,000 at auction in 2017. The buyer was a Chinese fancier named Xing Wei, according to media reports at the time.  Joel Verschoot, the Belgian breeder who put Armando up for auction, sold a total of 178 pigeons at auction for more than $2.5 million, including 7 of Armando's offspring. He also sold a bird named Contador, which fetched more than $225,000, per PIPA. Pigeon racing has become increasingly popular in parts of China among the country's elite and its middle class.  Sun Yan, the deputy general-secretary of Beijing Changing District Racing Pigeons Association, said at least 100,000 pigeon breeders live in Beijing, and almost 90,000 of them are registered with Racing Pigeons Associations in different levels, to qualify for the games held in the spring and autumn.  Competitions can be lucrative for bird owners, with some prizes amounting to tens of thousands of dollars. Liu said in recent years, pigeon racing has been surging in popularity across China. ""Now other people, like regular people, are joining too,"" he said. ""It will be bigger in the future."" Liu attributes the industry's growth and increasing professionalism to a number of factors. It is the only legal bidding race in mainland China, where most forms of gambling are outlawed, and the sport is becoming increasingly accessible. ""Everyone can do it. From regular people to some rich people. Regular people buy cheap pigeons. Rich people buy expensive pigeons.""  CNN's Nanlin Fang and Journalist Karoline Kan contributed reporting",5.0
1015395,"Commentary: In Syria strike, the real danger is Russia","In deciding whether and how to strike Syrian government installations following last week’s chemical weapons attack, the U.S. military might once have focused on inflicting real damage on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s rule. Instead, through simple but ruthless plotting, Vladimir Putin has made this crisis – like so many others these days – all about Russia. Much like President Barack Obama after an earlier, larger chemical strike in the Damascus suburbs in August 2013, President Donald Trump’s administration finds itself trapped by its own rhetoric. Like their predecessors, Trump administration officials are learning that prolonging their deliberations over a course of action makes physically taking it politically and militarily harder – and perhaps even pointless. Predictably, Syrian government forces have reportedly moved into positions as close as possible to their Russian counterparts, betting – probably correctly – that the United States will be desperate to avoid hitting them. Even a significantly larger strike than the one Trump launched last year will do little to change the war on the ground. Assad has already all but won the six-year war, and has continued to entrench his position this week. The Trump administration avoided this problem in the April 7, 2017 strikes by acting quickly – although that action, which Russia was warned of with very short notice, was also largely symbolic. Its planning was heavily the work of then-National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster. Last week’s attack on the rebel-held town of Douma, came just as John Bolton took over McMaster’s role, so the response has been slower and the administration more openly divided.  Both action and inaction now bring the risk of playing into Russia’s hands. The sheer level of force the United States has moved to the Mediterranean – with the aircraft carrier USS Harry S Truman sailing from Norfolk, Virginia last week – is a potent reminder that Washington’s military clout and reach still far eclipses Putin’s. The fact that it was necessary to take such a step, however, is also an unmistakable sign of weakness. The most likely scenario remains a limited U.S. strike with no Russian conventional military retaliation. If Putin does respond, it is more likely to be in a more ambiguous way, such as by stepping up his war in Western-allied Ukraine. Still, Moscow clearly wants the United States and its allies to remember just how much damage it could do if it wished. Ironically, a Russian-U.S. deal remains the best hope of stopping the escalating confrontation within Syria between Iran and Israel. Israel has stepped up attacks on what it believes are Iranian targets within the country, while Tehran is seen increasingly encouraging its local proxies – particularly Hamas and Hezbollah – to target the Jewish state. To talk, however, Moscow and Washington must stabilize this standoff – and for now, signs point the other way. Russia’s post-2015 military interventions in Syria, like its actions in Ukraine the previous year and in Georgia in 2008, have been a master class in how to achieve significant strategic effect with relatively few forces. In facing down its enemies – which now clearly include the United States and NATO – Moscow has always relied on the threat of its larger military clout, particularly nuclear force. On the Syria front over the last week, Russian officials have openly raised the threat of war between the nuclear superpowers,  an unmistakable attempt to stop the West from acting. Russia understands that any discussion of chemical weapons and classified evidence is likely to remind Western leaders – and electorates – of the incorrect intelligence on weapons of mass destruction that was used to justify the invasion of Iraq. Its online and broadcast outlets have been making such comparisons relentlessly, a sign of how central information warfare has become to Russia’s wider strategy. Some Kremlin watchers even suspect that Moscow may be deliberately goading Trump and the West into striking, hoping to deepen domestic divisions in Western countries and to justify whatever Putin’s next move might be. Significantly, Russian forces appear to have been directly interfering in the actions of their U.S. counterparts in a way previously unseen. This has reportedly included meddling with U.S. GPS signals in a way that has apparently affected the operations of American drones; Russian officials have warned of worse, including shooting down U.S. missiles and perhaps even targeting the aircraft and ships that fired them. This sort of thing isn’t entirely new. Russia is widely suspected to have interfered with GPS signals before, in both the Black Sea and the Baltic. Aggressive Russian over-flights of U.S. and other allied military vessels have become increasingly common. Using such tactics in a high-stakes international confrontation like this, however, is a significant escalation – and sets precedents Moscow will likely rely on in any future face-offs. For all the rhetoric and the very real danger of miscalculation, neither Washington nor Moscow wants to start a major war over Syria. Indeed, they may well not even wish to risk using their most sophisticated weapons. If Russia can indeed shoot down U.S. cruise missiles, it may decide to keep that technology under wraps. Similarly, the risk of weaponry falling into Russian hands means the United States may well hold back some of its cutting-edge technology too, saving it for a battle that matters more. Therein lies one of the greatest challenges of this situation. In 1990, after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait, the George H. W. Bush administration was relieved to find that Russia – then still in the hands of Mikhail Gorbachev – was inclined to avoid turning the conflict into a Cold War-style standoff. In the years that followed, successive U.S. presidents became used to acting without such worries. Putin has now successfully signaled that those days are entirely over.

1022016,"Trump says 'terrible, terrible fire' engulfs Notre Dame","Burnsville, Minnesota (CNN)President Donald Trump, in Minnesota for a Tax Day event, called the incident at Notre Dame in Paris a ""terrible, terrible fire"" that was likely caused by renovations.  ""When we left the plane it was burning at a level that you rarely see a fire burn,"" he said. The fire rapidly spread and took over the iconic cathedral as onlookers scrambled to get a view of the destruction, even as soot and cinder fell onto them. Firefighters atop cherry picker cranes sprayed water onto the church in an attempt to calm the flames. It was not immediately known what caused the fire and whether anybody was injured. The cathedral has been surrounded by scaffolding and was under construction. The President lamented the damage being done to the historic cathedral. ""That's beyond countries, that's beyond anything,"" he said. ""It's a part of our culture."" He said the fire would put ""a damper"" on the tax round table he was about to begin. Earlier Monday, he weighed in on Twitter with an unsolicited suggestion for Parisian firefighters. ""So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly!"" he tweeted. Vice President Mike Pence and first lady Melania Trump also tweeted on the fire. ""Notre Dame is an iconic symbol of faith to people all over the world -- and it is heartbreaking to see a house of God in flames. Our thoughts and prayers are with the firefighters on the scene and all the people of Paris,"" he said. And the first lady said she was ""praying for everyone's safety.""

1025629,"As outrage grows, India's top court places rights activists under house arrest","NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s Supreme Court ordered police on Wednesday to put five prominent rights campaigners suspected of links to Maoist guerrillas under house arrest as outrage grew over their detention. Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government have dismissed the allegations against the activists, who were detained a day earlier, and said the crackdown was part of ongoing attempts to stifle all dissent. Police detained the campaigners, seized their laptops and mobile phones, in raids on their homes in different cities, triggering protests and a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the action. Sudha Bharadwaj, who has been fighting for the rights of workers in parts of India such as Chhattisgarh where left-wing guerrilla groups operate, said the action against her was part of a broader crackdown on opponents of the government. “The effort is whatever is the opposition to this regime, whether it is workers rights, tribal rights, everybody who in the opposition is being rounded up,” she told reporters outside her home in Faridabad, a short distance from New Delhi. The arrests follow months of tensions between right wing nationalist groups and advocates of free speech that has played out in college campuses and spilled over into the streets. Critics also say several top journalists have been forced out of their jobs for their critical reporting of the government. The others detained on Tuesday included were Varavara Rao, a prominent poet from the southern city of Hyderabad, activists Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Ferreira from Mumbai and civil liberties activist Gautam Navlakha from New Delhi. Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party-led government has faced mounting criticism from activists and academics, who accuse it of undermining the secular and pluralistic principles of India’s constitution. The BJP denies these allegations but says it is opposed to appeasement of any community and has long advocated tough action to protect national security. “These five are no threat to anyone,” said Prashant Bhushan, a lawyer for a group of leading academics that has petitioned the Supreme Court to release the activists. “The charges against them on the face of it appear indiscriminate, unwarranted, part of a malicious campaign to threaten human rights defenders, independent journalists, writers and thinkers in the country from critiquing the government and its policies, and an attempt to muzzle dissent,” the petition said. Police have also accused the five of inflammatory speeches at a rally in western India last year which led to violent clashes between Dalits, the lowest in the Hindu caste hierarchy, and right wing organizations. A police officer said the main case relates to speeches made during a rally held in the city of Pune on Dec. 31, 2017 commemorating the valor of Dalits. The following day, violent clashes broke out between members of the lower caste and hardline Hindu groups. The police officer, who could not be named because he was not authorized to speak to reporters, said police had seized documents relating to the long-running Maoist insurgency afflicting parts of the country. The guerrillas are fighting for the rights of the landless in parts of eastern and southern India, dubbed “the Red Corridor”. The police officer said the five activists gave intellectual force to an insurgency in which thousands of people have been killed over the years. Modi faces an election next year and opposition parties are trying to forge an alliance to stop his Hindu nationalists from coming back to power. The Supreme Court headed by the chief justice Dipak Misra said it would hear the petition challenging the arrests of the activists next week and until then they would be placed under house arrest, and not police custody. Judge D.Y. Chandrachud, one of the judges on the bench said the right to criticize was a crucial for democracy. “Dissent is the safety valve of democracy. If dissent is disallowed, then the pressure cooker may burst,” he said. Additional reporting by Suchitra Mohanty ; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore",4.5

1034746,GAO: FBI has access to more than 641 million 'face photos',"Washington (CNN)The FBI has access to more than 641 million photos of people's faces in searchable form, a government watchdog official said on Tuesday.  The information released in prepared testimony from US Government Accountability Office homeland security and justice director Gretta Goodwin said the 641 million figure was accurate as of April 2019. In the release on Tuesday, the GAO said it had called on the Department of Justice and FBI to take further steps to improve privacy and ""ensure the accuracy of its face recognition capabilities.""  The FBI's available trove of photos contains some from its own face recognition system that includes photos from the criminal justice system, like mugshots, and others available from state and federal government databases, like driver's license photos, the GAO said. The 641 million figure refers specifically ""to photos, not the total number of identities,"" according to Goodwin's testimony.  The latest GAO information came out in a hearing before the House Oversight Committee on government use of facial recognition technology.  At the hearing on Tuesday, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan appeared to express dismay over the lack of consent from people to have their photos available to the FBI and the lack of legislative action on the issue. ""We learned that over 20 states, 20 states, have given their bureau of motor vehicles, department of motor vehicles, the database -- driver's license database, they've just given access to that to the FBI,"" Jordan, the committee's top Republican, said. ""No individual signed off on that when they renewed their driver's license, got their driver's licenses. They didn't sign any waiver saying, 'Oh it's OK to turn my information, my photo, over to the FBI.' No elected officials voted for that to happen."" The hearing convened Tuesday came as facial recognition technology has continued to progress and some politicians have sought to catch up on the latest developments, with San Francisco banning facial-recognition technology last month while its use elsewhere proliferates. Kimberly Del Greco, representing the FBI at Tuesday's hearing, said in her testimony that facial recognition could ""greatly enhance law enforcement capabilities and protect public safety,"" while pledging the bureau's commitment to ""the protection of privacy and civil liberties."" Goodwin also said in her testimony that FBI face recognition assisted in the arrest of one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted fugitives in 2017. Tuesday's hearing followed a similar House Oversight review last month on the topic and a GAO report from three years ago that called on the Justice Department and FBI to take six steps to improve ""privacy and accuracy"" regarding facial recognition.  The GAO said ""only one"" of its recommendations had been fully addressed in the years since its 2016 report. Goodwin noted in Tuesday's testimony that ""some academics and privacy advocates have questioned whether the technology is sufficiently accurate for this use."" ""In addition, the use of face recognition technology raises questions regarding the protection of privacy and individual civil liberties,"" she said.  ",3.0

1035145,"Iraq's parliament confirms cabinet ministers, but divisions remain","BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq’s parliament voted on Tuesday to approve three out of five ministers put forward by Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi, a step toward ending weeks of deadlock between the two largest parliamentary blocs. The approval of the ministers brings Abdul-Mahdi closer to completing his cabinet, but divisions over who will fill the posts have highlighted the weakness of his position. Intensifying disagreements between the rival Islah and Bina blocs, led by populist Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and Iran-backed militia leader Hadi al-Amiri, have prevented the formation of a full government of 22 ministers. At the heart of the weeks of fierce infighting are the nominations of the ministers of interior and defense - and both posts remain unfilled. Nuri al-Dulaimi, Qusay al-Suhail and Abdul Ameer al-Hamdani were confirmed to be ministers for planning, higher education and culture, respectively. They were approved after the Islah and Bina blocs agreed to allow a vote on five outstanding ministries - but not the defense and interior portfolios. The nominees for minister of education and minister of displacement and migration — the only women to be put forward so far — both failed to get enough votes. “We voted for the ministries which were not shrouded in disagreements,” said Sabah al-Ugaili, a lawmaker with the bloc led by Sadr. “Three won confidence, and two did not because we are not satisfied the candidates were fit for the job. Now the ball is in Abdul-Mahdi’s court, to replace them with other names — including the defense and interior ministries.” The deadlock over forming a cabinet has raised the prospect of further unrest as the country struggles to rebuild and recover after three years of war with Islamic State. The last time parliament attempted to vote on the nominees on Dec. 4, angry MPs disrupted the session, banging on tables and shouting “illegitimate” before forcing it to end. Parliament will next meet on Thursday, but it is unclear whether nominees for the vacant posts will be put up for confirmation votes. In his weekly news conference on Tuesday, Abdul-Mahdi said he expected a vote to take place on Thursday, however the most contentious ministries could be delayed to next week. Abdul-Mahdi said it was up to the political blocs to propose new names to fill the posts. Reporting by Ahmed Rasheed; Writing by Raya Jalabi; Editing by Alison Williams",3.5
1037716,UPDATE 2-Sodexo shares sink after warning on sales and profits,"* Now eyes FY 18 sales revenue growth of 1-1.5 pct * Sees FY 18 profit margin around 5.7 pct * North America remained weak in Q2, to weigh on H2 * Shares slump, set for worst day since Sept 2002 * H1 results due April 12 (Recasts with CEO call, analysts, shares) By Dominique Vidalon PARIS, March 29 (Reuters) - Food services and facilities management group Sodexo on Thursday cut its full-year sales and profit margin outlook and warned of weakness at its North American business, sending its shares sharply lower. Sodexo, the world’s second-biggest catering services company after Britain’s Compass Group, also gave an estimate of its first-half results, which came in below expectations. Sodexo manages canteens and facilities for offices, the military, schools, hospitals and prisons, and also supplies vouchers for meals and gifts. Its clients range from the Royal Ascot Racecourse in England to the U.S. Marine Corps. But its businesses in healthcare and education - such as schools and universities - in north America experienced a fall in first-half revenues, while cost savings to improve profits in that region had not yet kicked in. Sodexo also said profits from several large contracts had had a slower ramp up. New Chief Executive Denis Machuel, who took over in January, said: “It is very disappointing to start with having to reduce our guidance ... We have identified specific areas of underperformance and are acting quickly to implement a series of corrective measures,” Machuel said. Sodexo said it would address underperforming contracts and carry out a full review of its costs. Machuel said Sodexo would aim for a better balance between large contracts and medium or smaller-size contracts, and look to reinforce its focus on smaller, local food contracts. “I am confident we will deliver strong growth over the medium term,” he added. Sodexo shares were down 12.7 percent in mid-session trading, with the stock on track for its worst one-day percentage loss since September 2002. Sodexo’s troubles also hit the shares of rivals Compass and Elior. “Given management guidance we see potential for consensus EBIT downgrades of over 10 percent and material share pressure near term,” UBS analysts wrote in a note. Sodexo said it now expected to deliver organic revenue growth of between 1-1.5 percent for the 2018 fiscal year, and an underlying profit margin of around 5.7 percent. In January, Sodexo had forecast revenue growth of between 2-4 percent and a flat operating margin at 6.5 percent of sales for the full year ending August 31, 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency movements. For the first-half ended Feb. 28, organic revenue growth was 1.7 percent and underlying operating margin was 6.1 percent, with both coming below expectations, the company said. Jefferies analysts said Sodexo was likely to be preoccupied with devising and implementing a reboot strategy over the next few quarters to recover lost market share. Cost savings, which the group has yet to quantify, will be used to improve competitiveness, invest in digital, IT, marketing and sales to boost revenue, Sodexo said. Sodexo, which continues to generate “substantial free cash flow” will also make targeted acquisitions, notably in the food sector, said Machuel, who took over CEO Michel Landel who retired at the annual shareholders meeting on January 23. Machuel was Sodexo’s digital boss and deputy CEO since September 2017. The group has a medium-term objective of average annual revenue growth, excluding currency effects, of between 4 percent and 7 percent. Machuel said he was not revising it.

1043188,Ancient DNA reveals that Biblical-era Philistines may have originated in Europe," (CNN)The Philistines were related to Europeans, according to DNA evidence in a study published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. Scientists looked at the genomes of 10 Bronze and Iron Age individuals from Ashkelon, which is on the Mediterranean Sea about 40 miles west of Jerusalem and which was known in ancient times as one of five cities of the Philistines.  The ancient group, immortalized in the Hebrew Bible, arrived in the area in the 12th century BC. They found that the Philistines were genetically distinct from human remains from other ancient groups who lived in the area because they had a set of genes linked to Europeans. ""Of the available contemporaneous populations, we model the southern European gene pool as the best proxy for this incoming gene flow,"" the scientists wrote in the study. The Philistines may have had southern European ancestry Comparing results from the earliest-available Philistines with DNA from later Iron Age remains in the area, the scientists found that the European genes did not continue. These early European immigrants into what is now Israel would have essentially been absorbed into the existing population and would not have had a longer-term effect on the genetic makeup of people in the area. The Philistines are perhaps best-known as a group the Israelites were fighting in scenes depicted in the Book of Samuel. The Philistines sent out their great warrior Goliath, challenging the Israelites to put forth a fighter of their own so that the entire conflict would rest on the outcome of the duel. A young Israelite volunteered and killed the giant using a sling, propelling a small lethal stone at Goliath's head. So every time you talk about an underdog story as ""David vs. Goliath,"" you're making a Philistine reference. Results come from decades of archaeological work In 2016, archaeologists announced that they had unearthed the first Philistine cemetery, calling it the culmination of three decades of work. ""This cemetery is going to teach us a whole lot about the Philistines that we've never known before,"" Daniel Master, a professor at Wheaton College and co-director of the expedition in Ashkelon, said at the time. After 108 sets of skeletal remains were excavated, and 10 had enough DNA to be studied in depth. Master is also a co-author on the latest study. Over the years, scientists at the Ashkelon site have excavated Philistine houses and delved into what they would have eaten and who they would have traded with. The new study gives us the closest look yet at the people themselves and sheds light on their unusual origins. ",4.5
1049166,"EU Commission to present bad loans roadmap, may slow ECB plan: draft","LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - The European Commission will present on Wednesday a list of measures it plans to put forward by next spring on reducing bad loans held by European banks, a draft document said, a move that could slow similar moves by the European Central Bank. The ECB banking supervisor proposed last week that euro zone banks should set aside more cash from next year to cover newly classified bad loans and may also present additional measures to tackle the sector’s huge stock of bad debt which amounts to nearly 1 trillion euros. But the ECB move may be slowed by similar legislative proposals which the European Commission could put forward next year to tackle non-performing loans (NPLs). In a draft document to be released on Wednesday, the Commission said it could propose by spring changing banking rules “with regard to the possible introduction of minimum levels of provisioning which banks must make for NPLs”. The document said the possible measures “will prevent the build-up and potential underprovisioning of future NPLs stocks across member states and banks via time-bound prudential deductions from own funds.” While the aims coincide with the ECB plan, the Commission’s parallel process could slow things down. EU legislative proposals require the backing of EU states and parliamentarians, a process that takes usually several months or years before rules are finally agreed and enter into force. The Commission could also decide not to put forward new legislative proposals on the issue, one EU official said. The commission’s vice president Valdis Dombrovskis declined to comment on the matter in a news conference on Tuesday. In a separate report, also to be released on Wednesday, the commission will provide an interpretation of current banking rules and ECB powers. Enigmatically, the interpretation is set to clarify that “supervisory powers (..) allow the competent authorities to influence banks’ provisioning policies with regard to NPLs within the limits of the applicable accounting framework and to apply specific adjustments where necessary for prudential purposes,” the draft document seen by Reuters said. The 28 EU states agree in principle on the need to reduce bad loans but have different views on how fast to address the problem. Italy, whose banks are saddled with the highest amount of bad loans in the bloc, wants a gradual reduction of soured loans, fearing that an excessively fast unloading would create large capital holes in banks’ balance sheets. Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan openly criticized the approach taken by the ECB. Other states want to go faster. “I can only support the ECB with its position. A large majority of European finance ministers also supported (ECB chief Mario) Draghi on this point,” Germany’s outgoing Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said after a meeting of finance ministers in Luxembourg on Tuesday. The European Parliament said the strategy to tackle NPLs should be devised through a regular legislative process, rather than decided by the ECB unilaterally. “I seriously wonder whether specific additional obligations... can be imposed on supervised entities without appropriately involving the co-legislators in the decision-making process,” the parliament’s president Antonio Tajani said in a letter to Draghi. Banks have repeatedly voiced their concerns about plans to give supervisors more powers and warned against measures that could be excessive and unduly increase costs. In the documents to be released on Wednesday, the commission will also propose new measures to increase financial stability in Europe. It will reiterate plans to facilitate banks’ recovery of soured credit, and the development of a secondary market for bad loans, so that banks can sell them at higher prices.

1058934,Pricing rising on European buyout loans as investors push back,"LONDON (LPC) - A surge in supply in Europe’s leveraged loan market is giving investors ammunition to push back against aggressive pricing and documentation and win concessions from private equity firms and arranging banks as pricing moves higher. A series of deals have been flexed higher in recent weeks, including a €2.34bn term loan B for German metering business Techem. Pricing on the deal was flexed up to 375bp over Euribor from initial guidance of 350bp last Wednesday and several changes were made to documentation. A combination of increased deal flow, coupled with poor secondary trading levels on large aggressively priced and structured loans that were syndicated earlier this year, is giving investors the power to drive a harder bargain on aggressively structured deals. “Don’t give me documents that would have flown three months ago, we all know where the market is now,” a senior investor said. European primary pricing has risen in the last month and single B credits that were pricing at 300-325bp are now pricing at 350bp to 400bp. Most companies are paying 350-375bp, with better deals pricing tighter and weaker deals pricing wider, sources  said. Activity in the market has increased in recent months, with US$12.8bn of deals launching in May and US$14.4bn launching in June, up from US$7.7bn in April, according to ThomsonReuters LPC data, however the type of deals coming to the market has changed substantially from the repricings and refinancings that characterised 2017. The market has seen far more large new money loans this year as units are spun out of big corporations, including Unilever’s sale of its spreads business Flora Food Group. These businesses are sizeable and lack a market track record, which makes them more challenging for investors to analyse. Poor secondary trading levels on these big buyouts, however, is proving to be another deterrent for investors and is continuing to push primary pricing higher. Flora’s £700m sterling term loan B was quoted at 97.6 last Friday and its €2bn term loan B was at 97.52. Nearly a third of private equity backed buyout loans completed so far this year are trading between 99 and 97% of face value, with 22.8% of the loans at 98-99 and 8% at 97-98, LPC data shows. Many big institutional investors are now telling private equity firms that they are unwilling to look at transactions until they have made changes to aggressive documentation that some law firms have tried to establish as legal precedent. “It’s all wearing a bit thin. If the documentation is ludicrous, we’ll say go and rewrite it and we’ll look at it after that. I can’t be bothered to list the changes,” the senior investor said. Private equity firms are having to take a more pragmatic approach and make the changes that investors require upfront to get their deals fully subscribed as liquidity grows scarcer and investors take a tougher line as deals continue to launch before the summer break. “We’re saying fine, if you don’t change it, we won’t do your deal. If you do, we’ll do €50m,” a second investor said. The changes in the market are raising the question of how to get best execution and result as investors get pickier. The days of ‘discovery’, where aggressive deals are launched into an overheated market to see if they will fly, may be over for now. “It is a better tactic to come out with a less aggressive deal, rather than a very sharp deal that has to be recut three times,” a third investor said. While excess supply is currently aiding that argument, any reversal of that dynamic could weaken the current investor-friendly environment and give private equity firms the upper hand again, bankers and investors said.

1060573,China's hacking against U.S. on the rise: U.S. intelligence official,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A senior U.S. intelligence official said on Tuesday that Chinese cyber activity in the United States had risen in recent months, targeting critical infrastructure in what may be attempts to lay the groundwork for future disruptive attacks. “You worry they are prepositioning against critical infrastructure and trying to be able to do the types of disruptive operations that would be the most concern,” National Security Agency official Rob Joyce said at a Wall Street Journal cybersecurity conference. Joyce, a former White House cyber adviser for President Donald Trump, did not elaborate. A spokeswoman for the NSA said Joyce was referring to digital attacks against the U.S. energy, financial, transportation and healthcare sectors. The comments are notable because U.S. complaints about Chinese hacking have to date focused on espionage and intellectual property theft, not efforts to disrupt critical infrastructure. China has repeatedly denied U.S. allegations it conducts cyber attacks. Joyce’s remarks coincide with U.S. prosecutors preparing to unveil as early as this week a new round of criminal hacking charges against Chinese nationals. They are expected to charge that Chinese hackers were involved in a cyber espionage operation known as “Cloudhopper” targeting technology service providers and their customers, according to people familiar with the matter. The U.S. Congress is looking into the allegations of increased Chinese hacking activity.

1068643,"PRECIOUS-Gold flat as rate hike concerns, trade tensions weigh","* Strong U.S. data suggests interest rates will rise * Gold finds strong resistance at $1,200 - ANZ * Palladium off near 12-week highs hit on Monday (Adds comments, updates prices) By Sethuraman N R BENGALURU, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Gold prices held steady during Asian trade on Tuesday as investors remained on the sidelines amid expectations of a U.S. interest rate hike this month and on fears of an escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war. Spot gold was mostly unchanged at $1,195.79 an ounce at 0654 GMT. U.S. gold futures rose 0.1 percent to $1,201.60. Strong U.S. payrolls data last week cemented expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in September, in what would be its third hike this year, with expectations of one rise more in December. Higher rates increase bond yields, making the non-yielding bullion less attractive and tend to boost the dollar. “The precious metal has shown excruciating weakness as the U.S. economy demonstrated a stellar performance in Q2 2018,” said Benjamin Lu, commodities analyst at Phillip Futures. Traders were bracing for a potential escalation in the Sino-U.S. row after President Donald Trump raised the stakes on Friday by saying he was ready to impose tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports to the United States. The rhetoric has made investors buy the dollar in the belief that the United States has less to lose from a trade war - making dollar-priced gold more expensive for non-U.S. buyers. “The imposition of increased tariffs (between the United States and China) will indefinitely damage global economic conditions in the longer term ... However, safe-haven demand remains weak for the shorter term as markets fixate on stronger dollar prospects,” Lu said. Gold prices dropped more than 12 percent from a peak in April with the metal losing its safe-haven status to the U.S. dollar, driving investors to raise their bearish bets on Comex gold and liquidate gold exchange traded funds. “With the greenback supported by expectations of higher U.S. interest rates, this may translate to nothing but further pain for gold,” said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, adding that spot prices could drop to $1,185-$1,160 levels in the short- to medium-term. Meanwhile, physical gold buying waned slightly in Asia this week as investors waited to see if prices would fall further, traders said. The yellow metal is finding strong resistance at $1,200, with investors selling into any rallies that threaten to push it above that level, ANZ analysts said in a research note. Among other precious metals, spot silver rose 0.3 percent to $14.19 an ounce, platinum climbed 1 percent to $790.20 an ounce. Palladium gained 0.6 percent to $981.10 an ounce, after hitting its highest in nearly 12 weeks at $991.15.

RHP Miguel Gonzalez was pulled after 21 pitches with a strained right groin and in all likelihood will be placed on the disabled list. He had a similar injury while with the Orioles and had to go on the DL. “It probably looks like it,” White Sox manager Robin Ventura said. “It was enough that he knew he pulled it pretty good, so, there’s a pretty good chance of that.

1084500,"'Fantastic Beasts 2' details: New locations, new characters & more","We couldn't tell you where to find fantastic beasts, but we can point you to all the latest details about Fantastic Beasts. Shooting on the sequel began Monday, July 3, and to mark the occasion, Warner Bros. has shared a whole bunch of new info about the as-yet-untitled film. Here's what you need to know. That includes Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander, Katherine Waterston as Tina Goldstein, Alison Sudol as Queenie Goldstein, and Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski, plus Johnny Deppas Gellert Grindelwald, Ezra Miller as Credence, Zoë Kravitz as Leta Lestrange, and Kevin Guthrie as Abernathy.  How exactly Newt winds up reuniting with his pals from the first film remains to be seen, as the Fantastic Beasts sequel, written by J.K. Rowling, takes the gang to London and Paris. Whatever happens, though, expect lots of drama – the official synopsis teases that ""his mission will also test their loyalties as they face new perils in an increasingly dangerous and divided wizarding world.""  Those joining the franchise for the first time include Jude Law as young Dumbledore and Callum Turner as Newt Scamander's big brother, a war hero Auror named Theseus.  We can also look forward to meeting a wizard named Yusuf Kama (William Nadylam) and a bounty hunter named Grimmson (Ingvar Sigurdsson). Oh, and also ... We're not sure yet how, but it's telling that two of the new key characters are associated with a wizarding circus. One of its attractions is an unnamed young woman played by Claudia Kim (Avengers: Age of Ultron), and the whole thing is run by Skender, played by Ólafur Darri Ólafsson.  Hmm ... interesting that Kim's is the only new character announced so far whose name has not yet been revealed. Maybe it means nothing. Or maybe her identity is being kept secret because it's a big, fat spoiler. Fantastic Beasts ended with Gellert Grindelwald being unmasked and taken into custody. Apparently, though, he didn't stay behind bars for long. The sequel picks up a few months later and sees Grindelwald escaped from prison and attracting a more robust following than ever. It's up to Albus Dumbledore to stop him, with some help from his former student Newt.  Which is gonna lead to a lot of complicated feelings, no doubt. As Potterheads know, Albus and Gellert weren't just BFFs – Albus was in love with Gellert before their entire relationship fell apart. It should be interesting to see how (or if) the Fantastic Beasts sequel lets that dynamic play out onscreen. Per the press release: ""There are also some surprising nods to the Harry Potter stories that will delight fans of the books and film series.""  In other words, keep your eyes peeled when Fantastic Beasts arrives in theaters November 16, 2018. And then continue keeping your eyes peeled, because this is just the second entry in a planned five-film series. ",3.5
1087889,"In volatile Kenya, MP and former senator detained over hate speech allegations","NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police detained a ruling party lawmaker and a former opposition senator on Monday for alleged hate speech, as political tensions simmered following the Supreme Court’s decision to annul the presidential election. Both the candidates in that ballot, incumbent president Uhuru Kenyatta and veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga, also ratcheted up the temperature in public speeches on Monday and the opposition said it would boycott the opening of parliament. Politics in Kenya often follows ethnic lines and has in the past erupted into deadly violence, making the authorities sensitive to perceived inflammatory statements. Reported instances of hate speech have risen sharply since the surprise ruling on Sept. 1, the first of its kind in Africa, when the supreme court voided Kenyatta’s reelection citing irregularities in the tallying process. “Moses Kuria, a member of parliament and Johnson Muthama, a former senator, have been arrested on hate speech allegations,” interior ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka told Reuters by phone. Njoka did not give further details, and police did not respond to queries. Last week, Kuria gave a public speech calling for a “manhunt” for Odinga’s supporters, who had greeted the court ruling with jubilation. Two witnesses described a roadblock set up the next day near where Kuria gave his speech, where ruling party supporters checked the ethnicity of passengers in vehicles to see if they might be opposition supporters. On Sunday, Muthama, a former senator for the opposition Wiper party, gave a speech peppered with insults aimed at Kenyatta. In a televised speech on Monday, Kenyatta said the ruling party might use its majority in the legislature to impeach Odinga if the opposition leader won the new polls, scheduled for Oct. 17. “Even if he is elected, we have the opportunity in parliament within two months, three months to kick him out,” Kenyatta said in a nationally televised speech. Waikwa Wanyoike, a barrister specializing in constitutional law, said the government’s majority fell short of the majority needed in both houses to impeach a president. “It’s just posturing. It requires a two-thirds majority in both houses ... there also has to be grounds to do it. They can manufacture grounds but it’s hard to manufacture the numbers,” he said. Odinga, meanwhile, accused the government of a mass sterilization campaign under the guise of giving tetanus vaccinations. “Hundreds of thousands of our girls and women between 14 and 49 will not have children because of state-sponsored sterilization sold to the country as tetanus vaccination,” Odinga said at a press conference.  Odinga cited Kenya’s Lancet laboratories as one of his sources. But Dr Ahmed Kelebi, managing director of Lancet, said such claims were based on debunked misinterpretations of their data. After Odinga spoke, a founding member of his opposition alliance, Moses Wetangula, said the opposition would boycott the opening of parliament on Tuesday. “(Opposition) members of parliament from both houses will not attend the intended opening of the house because the president is a lame duck president,” Wetangula said. “He is enjoying temporary incumbency and has got no moral authority whatsoever to officially open parliament.” additional reporting by Katharine Houreld, John Ndiso and Duncan Miriri; Writing by Katharine Houreld; Editing by Toby Chopra and Andrew Heavens",3.5
1089524,Foxtons says sales could fall further in 2017,"LONDON (Reuters) - London-focused estate agent Foxtons said sales could continue to fall this year after a slump in demand pushed down 2016 core earnings by nearly 50 percent, due to a property tax hike and the impact of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. Foxtons, once a symbol of London’s surging property market, floated in 2013 ahead of the peak of the boom, and has since failed more than once to meet market expectations, including as early as 2014. The firm, known for its chain of coffee shop-style outlets and fleet of Mini cars, said earnings before interest, tax, deprecations and amortization (EBITDA) fell by 46 percent to 25 million pounds last year, lower than the 28 million forecast by a Thomson Reuters poll of analysts. Central London property prices have fallen sharply in recent months, according to a series of surveys, after a tax hike introduced in April hit demand for top-end homes, compounded by the uncertainty for particularly foreign investors of the Brexit vote. “(There was a) significant fall in sales volumes immediately following the first quarter of 2016,” said Chief Executive Nic Budden. “Should current levels of sales activity continue in the short term, it is likely that 2017 volumes will be below those in 2016,” he said. Britain’s third-largest housebuilder Taylor Wimpey also said on Wednesday that lower selling prices in central London had affected its performance, with the value of its full-year order book falling marginally. While overall revenue fell at Foxtons, fourth-quarter lettings revenue was flat at 13 million pounds, a strong area for the firm which could be hit by the introduction of a ban on lettings fees announced by the government in November.

1096703,Mitsubishi Heavy shares jump on favorable ruling in $6.7-billion claim,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (MHI) (7011.T) jumped over 6 percent on Tuesday after an international arbitrator ruled in its favor over a $6.7 billion compensation claim against the company related to the shutdown of California’s San Onofre nuclear plant. Southern California Edison (SCE), a unit of Edison International (EIX.N), had raised a claim with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) demanding compensation from MHI. Both MHI and SCE said the ICC has ordered the former to pay $125 million to the nuclear plant owners. The arbitrator also ordered the plant owners to pay $58 million in legal fees to MHI. “With the end of the U.S. nuclear legal dispute, which had been feared to weigh on MHI’s net profit, the company’s short-term risks are expected to be cleared,” Mizuho Securities analyst Masanori Wakae said in a report. SCE was seeking $6.7 billion, accusing MHI of contract violations for failing to properly design or quickly repair two steam generators it built for the utility’s now-closed San Onofre nuclear plant. One of the steam generators, which came with a 20-year warranty, developed a small radioactive coolant leak after a year, forcing SCE to take the plant off-line in early 2012. SCE announced retirement of San Onofre in June 2013 and filed the arbitration claim against MHI with ICC four months later. MHI maintained that its contractual liability on the matter is limited to up to $137 million. “We had hoped the award would more accurately reflect the true magnitude of damage caused by Mitsubishi’s defective steam generators,” said SCE President Ron Nichols in a statement. “Unfortunately, the arbitration panel concluded that the contract’s prescribed liability limit should be respected and no additional award can be granted despite the harm caused,” he said. In morning trade, MHI shares rose 6.4 percent to 477.5 yen, even as the broader market's .TOPX fell 0.2 percent. Reporting by Taiga Uranaka; Editing by Vyas Mohan",3.5

For those unfamiliar, the technology works by sending multiple data signals over the same radio channel to increase transmission speeds. MegaMIMO 2.0 cleverly coordinates multiple access points, all broadcasting on the same limited frequency and spectrum, to boost speeds and signal strength without degrading the signal. So why can’t you already just install two or three wireless routers in your home to boost your wi-fi speeds? Multiple access points all broadcasting on the same frequency will end up creating interference, making it difficult for a device to decipher the data stream. It’s like when two radio stations are broadcasting on the same frequency while you’re driving between two cities, the signal gets through, but it’s a garbled mess.The breakthrough the MIT CSAIL team came up with was new signal-processing algorithms that allow multiple access points and transmitters to synchronize their phases to eliminate interference. With multiple wireless routers all broadcasting at the same time, more data streams can be simultaneously broadcasted than standard MIMO techniques allow. Just think of how much faster a file being torrented can be downloaded when there are more sources available, and you’ll have a better idea of why this new technique can speed up wi-fi.The researchers have already demonstrated MegaMIMO 2.0 working on up to four access points at the same time, but they’re confident the new approach could be effectively used on dozens of wireless routers at the same time. But eventually it could also mean that installing multiple access points at home would do more than just kill wi-fi dead spots in your house.[MIT CSAIL]",4.0

His statement following the meeting is so absurd and out of touch with reality that there is simply no way to write about it rationally.Trump’s primary assertion, that hacking “had absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election,” is so deeply inane that it pains me to even republish it. Even if you enthusiastically voted for Trump, look deep inside yourself and try to imagine a universe in which the hacking and strategic leaking of a party’s emails  during a contentious campaign had no effect on the election. Of course it had an effect on the outcome of the election. We all agree that John Podesta and the Democratic National Committee’s emails were hacked and leaked. There is just no plausible way this couldn’t have an effect on the election. It’s not a partisan issue. If you  believe even a shred of this, know that Trump is lying to you. Trump’s statement in fullTrump then talks about the need to prevent cyber attacks. “The methods, tools and tactics we use to keep America safe should not be a public discussion that will benefit those who seek to do us harm,” Trump says.  What Trump probably thinks sounds like a shrewd strategy to prevent hacking actually sounds like a chilling and deeply disturbing campaign that could trample our rights and leave America in the dark. Trump’s vision of America’s intelligence community is one of increased secrecy and even less accountability to the American public that funds it, it seems. In the same way that Trump says he has a secret plan to defeat the Islamic State, I guess he also has secret plan to prevent hacking by nation states like Russia and China. How do you even respond to something so absurd?There isn’t much else to say, really. Trump has pretty clearly demonstrated that he’s a clueless pathological liar, so you better strap in for four years of some really awful shit.",3.5

Did the paper question the racial superiority of Steve Bannon or doubt the size of Trump’s enormous hands? Nope. The paper accidentally ran a photo of Alec Baldwin playing Donald Trump on SNL instead of a photo showing the real president.El Nacional published an article on Friday about President Trump’s views on settlements in Israel. The piece included an accurate photo of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but the photo of Trump was a bit... off.The newspaper ran a correction, explaining that they had just pulled the photo from the Associated Press wire service and that it simply went unnoticed by everyone who reviewed it. Who among us hasn’t made that mistake, right? I mean, real life has become so absurd that it’s basically beyond parody at this point.The error has been picked up and ridiculed on social media, with plenty of people wondering if the Dominican Republic will now be added to Trump’s list of banned countries, referring to the seven predominantly Muslim countries from which Trump has tried to restrict travel.And sadly, they might not be wrong about countries from Central and South America getting added to the list. The Trump regime is expected to sign a new executive order on Monday, and one way that he might try to get around the unconstitutionality of banning travelers by religion is by expanding the order to include other “dangerous” countries—countries which could be predominantly Catholic, for instance, where many refugees are fleeing gang violence.With Trump’s Immigrations and Customs Enforcement stepping up deportations in the past week, it’s certainly a possibility.

""We are always looking for potential acquisitions that make sense for the business and support Tesla’s mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy,” a Tesla spokesperson said in a statement. The purchase — expected to close later this year — will give Tesla more access to building cells, battery systems, and modules for its battery-powered vehicles, and energy supplies. Currently, Tesla's Reno, Nevada Gigafactory is the main site for its own battery production with Panasonic.  With demand for Tesla's latest EV, the Model 3, higher than ever and an unfulfilled promise for a cheaper base model, the car maker needs to keep up with battery manufacturing, not just making the cars at its Fremont, California car plant. Maxwell also makes ultracapacitors which could advance Tesla's battery technology. In other energy news, Tesla Powerpack batteries will power more than 100 Electrify America electric vehicle charging stations across the country. The 210 kW battery system will go into stations throughout the year and provide 350 kWh of charging capacity. That's considered fast charging, a hallmark of the Tesla brand.

1116509,Newly Named Titanosaur Was the Largest Land Animal Our Planet Has Ever Seen,"A replica of the newly described titanosaur at AMNH. (Image: AP)Four years after six specimens were discovered in Argentina, scientists have finally given a name to what is now considered the largest animal to ever have walked the Earth. Say hello to Patagotitan mayorum—a Cretaceous-era dinosaur that weighed an astonishing 152,000 pounds. Before we get into the details of the new study, published today in the Royal Society B, let’s just quickly go over how impossibly big this titanosaur actually was.The average weight of these behemoths was 76 tons, or 152,000 pounds, which is nearly the weight of the Space Shuttle, or 10 African elephants. A typical  Patagotitan mayorum measured about 112 feet long (37 meters), which is 70 percent the width of a football field. The top of its shoulder reached 20 feet high (6 meters), or about four humans stacked on top of each other’s shoulders.The researchers came up with these numbers after analyzing six specimens, and more than 160 individual fossils, all of which were found in the same quarry. The newly described dinosaur was named after the Patagonian region in which the bones were uncovered, the Greek word titan (no translation required), and Mayo, which is the name of the family that hosted the researchers during the excavations. Reconstructed skeleton and body silhouette of Patagotitan mayorum showing preserved elements from the six specimens. (Image: J. L. Carballido et al., 2017) So these things were stupidly huge, and their existence is resetting our notions of just how big sauropod titanosaurs—a diverse and highly successful group of four-legged herbivorus dinosaurs— actually got. The discovery of Patagotitan mayorum [pronounced pata-go-titan may-or-oom] bumps another species of titanosaur, Argentinosaurus, to second place on the all-time biggest land animals list. Blue whales, which can weigh as much as 400,000 pounds, are still the largest animals known to have appeared on Earth—past or present. But unlike P. mayorum and other titanosaurs, blue whales don’t have to stand on four legs.Needless to say, however, these creatures were not swift of foot or fierce. They likely plodded around, searching for what must’ve been an endless supply of foliage. And indeed, the researchers who conducted the analysis, a team led by Diego Pol of the Egidio Feruglio paleontology museum in Argentina, ascribe this dinosaur’s enormity (or tendency towards “gigantism,” in their words) to the tremendous abundance of flowering plants that were available 100 million years ago. Interestingly, Pol suspects that P. mayorum was hitting a wall in terms of how large land animals could get. “All contenders for the largest dinosaur species were similar sized, within a 10 to 15 percent difference,” he told National Geographic. “This suggests we are approaching the maximum possible body size for a terrestrial animal, which was unknown until recently, and it is an exciting discovery.”Titanosaur skull displayed at AMNH.

1117353,Why Banning Killer AI Is Easier Said Than Done,"An unmanned US Predator drone flies over Kandahar Air Field, southern Afghanistan, on a moon-lit night. (Image: AP)As we head deeper into the 21st century, the prospect of getting robots to do the dirty business of killing gets closer with each passing day. In Max Tegmark’s new book, Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence, the MIT physicist and founder of the Future of Life Institute contemplates this seemingly scifi possibility, weighing the potential benefits of autonomous machines in warfare with the tremendous risks. The ultimate challenge, he says, will be convincing world powers to pass on this game-changing technology.AI has the potential to transform virtually every aspect of our existence, but it’s not immediately clear if we be able to fully control this awesome power. Radical advances in AI could conceivably result in a utopian paradise, or a techno-hell worthy of a James Cameron movie script. Among Tegmark’s many concerns is the prospect of autonomous killing machines, where humans are kept “out of the loop” when the time comes for a robot to kill an enemy combatant. As with so many things, the devil is in the details, and such a technology could introduce a host of unanticipated complications and risks—some of them of an existential nature.Gizmodo is excited to share an exclusive excerpt from Life 3.0, in which Tegmark discusses the pros and cons of outsourcing life-and-death decision making to a machine, a recent initiative to institute an international ban on autonomous killing machines, and why it’ll be so difficult for the United States to relinquish this prospective technology. From Chapter 3: The Near Future: Breakthroughs, Bugs, Laws, Weapons and JobsSince time immemorial, humanity has suffered from famine, disease and war. In the future, AI may help reduce famine and disease, but how about war?Some argue that nuclear weapons deter war between the countries that own them because they’re so horrifying, so how about letting all nations build even more horrifying AI-based weapons in the hope of ending all war forever? If you’re unpersuaded by that argument and believe that future wars are inevitable, how about using AI to make these wars more humane? If wars consist merely of machines fighting machines, then no human soldiers or civilians need get killed. Moreover, future AI-powered drones and other autonomous weapon systems (AWS; also known by their opponents as “killer robots”) can hopefully be made more fair and rational than human soldiers: equipped with superhuman sensors and unafraid of getting killed, they might remain cool, calculating and level-headed even in the heat of battle, and be less likely to accidentally kill civilians.A Human in the LoopBut what if the automated systems are buggy, confusing or don’t behave as expected? The U.S. Phalanx system for Aegis-class cruisers automatically detects, tracks and attacks threats such as anti-ship missiles and aircraft. The USS Vincennes was a guided missile cruiser nicknamed Robocruiser in reference to its Aegis system, and on July 3, 1988, in the midst of a skirmish with Iranian gunboats during the Iran-Iraq war, its radar system warned of an incoming aircraft. Captain William Rodgers III inferred that they were being attacked by a diving Iranian F-14 fighter jet and gave the Aegis system approval to fire. What he didn’t realize at the time was that they shot down Iran Air Flight 655, a civilian Iranian passenger jet, killing all 290 people on board and causing international outrage. Subsequent investigation implicated a confusing user interface that didn’t automatically show which dots on the radar screen were civilian planes (Flight 655 followed its regular daily flight path and had its civilian aircraft transponder on) or which dots were descending (as for an attack) vs. ascending (as Flight 655 was doing after takeoff from Tehran). Instead, when the automated system was queried for information about the mysterious aircraft, it reported “descending” because that was the status of a different aircraft to which it had confusingly reassigned a number used by the navy to track planes: what was descending was instead a U.S. surface combat air patrol plane operating far away in the Gulf of Oman.In this example, there was a human in the loop making the final decision, who under time pressure placed too much trust in what the automated system told him. So far, according to defense officials around the world, all deployed weapons systems have a human in the loop, with the exception of low-tech booby traps such as land mines. But development is now under way of truly autonomous weapons that select and attack targets entirely on their own. It’s militarily tempting to take all humans out of the loop to gain speed: in a dog- fight between a fully autonomous drone that can respond instantly and a drone reacting more sluggishly because it’s remote-controlled by a human halfway around the world, which one do you think would win?The Phalanx CIWS close-in weapons system. (Image: US Navy)However, there have been close calls where we were extremely lucky that there was a human in the loop. On October 27, 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, eleven U.S. Navy destroyers and the aircraft carrier USS Randolph had cornered the Soviet submarine B-59 near Cuba, in international waters outside the U.S. “quarantine” area. What they didn’t know was that the temperature onboard had risen past 45°C (113°F) because the submarine’s batteries were running out and the air-conditioning had stopped. On the verge of carbon dioxide poisoning, many crew members had fainted. The crew had had no contact with Moscow for days and didn’t know whether World War III had already begun. Then the Americans started drop- ping small depth charges, which they had, unbeknownst to the crew, told Moscow were merely meant to force the sub to surface and leave. “We thought—that’s it—the end,” crew member V. P. Orlov recalled. “It felt like you were sitting in a metal barrel, which somebody is constantly blasting with a sledgehammer.” What the Americans also didn’t know was that the B-59 crew had a nuclear torpedo that they were authorized to launch without clearing it with Moscow. Indeed, Captain Savitski decided to launch the nuclear torpedo. Valentin Grigorievich, the torpedo officer, exclaimed: “We will die, but we will sink them all—we will not disgrace our navy!” Fortunately, the decision to launch had to be authorized by three officers on board, and one of them, Vasili Arkhipov, said no. It’s sobering that very few have heard of Arkhipov, although his decision may have averted World War III and been the single most valuable contribution to humanity in modern history. It’s also sobering to contemplate what might have happened had B-59 been an autonomous AI-controlled submarine with no humans in the loop.Two decades later, on September 9, 1983, tensions were again high between the superpowers: the Soviet Union had recently been called an “evil empire” by U.S. president Ronald Reagan, and just the previous week, it had shot down a Korean Airlines passenger plane that strayed into its airspace, killing 269 people—including a U.S. congressman. Now an automated Soviet early-warning system reported that the United States had launched five land-based nuclear missiles at the Soviet Union, leaving Officer Stanislav Petrov merely minutes to decide whether this was a false alarm. The satellite was found to be operating properly, so following protocol would have led him to report an incoming nuclear attack. Instead, he trusted his gut instinct, figuring that the United States was unlikely to attack with only five missiles, and reported to his commanders that it was a false alarm without knowing this to be true. It later became clear that a satellite had mistaken the Sun’s reflections off cloud tops for flames from rocket engines. I wonder what would have happened if Petrov had been replaced by an AI system that properly followed proper protocol.*Once mass-produced, small AI-powered killer drones are likely to cost little more than a smartphone. Whether it’s a terrorist wanting to assassinate a politician or a jilted lover seeking revenge on his ex-girlfriend, all they need to do is upload their target’s photo and address into the killer drone: it can then fly to the destination, identify and eliminate the person, and self-destruct to ensure that nobody knows who was responsible. Alternatively, for those bent on ethnic cleansing, it can easily be programmed to kill only people with a certain skin color or ethnicity. The Berkeley AI professor Stuart Russell envisions that the smarter such weapons get, the less material, firepower and money will be needed per kill. For example, he fears bumblebee-sized drones that kill cheaply using minimal explosive power by shooting people in the eye, which is soft enough to allow even a small projectile to continue into the brain. Or they might latch on to the head with metal claws and then penetrate the skull with a tiny shaped charge. If a million such killer drones can be dispatched from the back of a single truck, then one has a horrifying weapon of mass destruction of a whole new kind: one that can selectively kill only a prescribed category of people, leaving everybody and everything else unscathed.A common counterargument is that we can eliminate such concerns by making killer robots ethical—for example, so that they’ll only kill enemy soldiers. But if we worry about enforcing a ban, then how would it be easier to enforce a requirement that enemy autonomous weapons be 100% ethical than to enforce that they aren’t produced in the first place? And can one consistently claim that the well-trained soldiers of civilized nations are so bad at following the rules of war that robots can do better, while at the same time claiming that rogue nations, dictators and terrorist groups are so good at following the rules of war that they’ll never choose to deploy robots in ways that violate these rules? For this and other reasons, thousands of AI researchers have come out in support of an international treating restricting the development and use of lethal autonomous weapons.CyberwarAnother interesting military aspect of AI is that it may let you attack your enemy even without building any weapons of your own, through cyberwarfare. As a small prelude to what the future may bring, the Stuxnet worm, widely attributed to the U.S. and Israeli governments, infected fast-spinning centrifuges in Iran’s nuclear-enrichment program and caused them to tear themselves apart. The more automated society gets and the more powerful the attacking AI becomes, the more devastating cyberwarfare can be. If you can hack and crash your enemy’s self-driving cars, auto-piloted planes, nuclear reactors, industrial robots, communication systems, financial systems and power grids, then you can effectively crash his economy and cripple his defenses. If you can hack some of his weapons systems as well, even better.*Without a doubt, there are some spectacular near-term opportunities for AI to benefit humanity—if we manage to make it robust and unhackable. Although AI itself can be used to make AI systems more robust, thereby aiding the cyberwar defense, AI can clearly aid the offense as well. Ensuring that the defense prevails must be one of the most crucial short-term goals for AI development—otherwise all the awesome technology we build can be turned against us!From the book LIFE 3.0 by Max Tegmark, © 2017 by Max Tegmark.

That’s the big news, but there were a few additional bits of info that might convince you to give it a chance.Our Apple iPhone X Event Liveblog Is Right HereIt’s iPhone day!Read more ReadDesignThe black hockey-puckish case of the Apple TV has largely stayed the same over the years and this edition is no different. It’ll still look just fine in your entertainment center.HardwareWith a six-core A10X Fusion processor split between apps and background processes, the new Apple TV has the same amount of power as an iPad Pro. It can handle 4K video at 60 frames per second, is packing 3 GB RAM, and supports HDR 10 for all of your high dynamic range color needs. This brings Apple up to speed with its competitors who’ve been offering 4K and HDR for a while. No new announcements were made for the Apple remote. 4K moviesIt looks like Apple won in its previously reported negotiations with movie studios because it’ll be offering their 4K movies at the same price as HD. Also, all of the HD movies in your library can be upgraded to 4K for no charge. Apple’s promising that Netflix and Amazon Prime’s 4K content is coming soon. Killer app?Jenova Chen CEO of thatgamecompany came out on stage to introduce Sky, a game with Apple TV in mind. It’s a “romantic adventure game” that looks similar to the company’s previous hits like Journey and Flower. Chen showed off some pretty footage and emphasized that “everything can be done with one finger” on the Apple remote. Everything thatgamecompany has made is beloved and considered an instant classic. It may not be as big as bringing Miyamoto out on stage, but this is a perfect partnership for Apple as it struggles to convince people that Apple TV is for gaming. This company’s games are all about providing a rapturous experience on a big screen. No release date was announced.The TV app running on an iPhone and iPadUser interfaceThe UI has been reworked and optimized for 4K along with the screensavers. A new iteration of Apple’s useless TV app was also demonstrated. It now has a tweaked interface,  has added some live news and sports features, and is as unexciting as ever. Price and launch dateThe 32 GB model is going for $179.99, and the 64GB model is $199. You can also get the non-4K Apple TV for the usual $150. Orders can be placed starting on September 15th and it’s out on September 22nd.How it comparesHere’s what its closest competitors will cost you:Nvidia Shield - $199.99Roku 4K UHD - $99.99Amazon Fire TV - $89.99Chromecast Ultra - $69.99Without the benefit of actually using the new Apple TV, the only thing we can tell you is what makes it different than the others on paper. Overall, its hardware is slightly better than the rest, just edging out Roku’s quad-core processor which is also capable of displaying 2160p at 60 FPS.Apple’s box also has a decent-sized hard drive for storing those 4K films that might not run so smoothly on your wi-fi connection. The Apple TV is generally pricier than its more widely-used competition and that puts it into an awkward zone of costing less than a 4K gaming machine like the PS4 Pro, but quite a bit more than a basic streaming device. If you’re fine with paying a premium for a blazing fast streamer that also plays mobile OS games, the only other choice is the Nvidia Shield. Time will tell how they compare, but on specs alone, the Shield has a Tegra X1 processor with a 256-core Maxwell GPU that crushes Apple.All-in-all, it looks like Apple has done what it normally does: produced a catch-up device that’s a little better (and pricier) than the competition. We’ll see how long that lasts.",4.5
1120567,Twitter Regrets to Inform You That Waluigi Is a Bigot,"Image: NintendoEarlier this afternoon, the crumbling hate circus we call Twitter rolled out some much-needed changes to its abuse report feedback system. This was, and is, welcome news. But contained in Twitter Safety’s example image was a subtle clue that undermines the whimsical Mario-verse.It seems Waluigi, dear readers, is a bigot.Image: Twitter SafetyThese safety changes give aggrieved users of Twitter updates on how abuse reports are being processed, including a more transparent glimpse into the site’s response and what specific policies may have been broken by a reported user. In the case of “Example User 1""—identified only by an image of the lanky Nintendo villain—Waluigi has apparently been using Twitter to post abusive information on his profile and tweet out hateful imagery. For reference, Twitter defines “hateful imagery” as:logos, symbols, or images whose purpose is to promote hostility and malice against others based on their race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity/national origin.In the greater Nintendo canon, Waluigi is clearly defined as an antagonist and a poor sport. But (given the opportunity, and the unfortunate incursion of social media into the Mushroom Kingdom) would Luigi’s nemesis really stoop to tweet gas chamber pepes and swastikas? Like any researcher pressed for time, I turned to Wikipedia for a history of Big Daddy Purp’s misdeeds, which amounted to the following (emphasis ours):He acts as the main antagonist in Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix, in which he wreaks havoc in the Mushroom Kingdom by pilfering special objects called the Music Keys to hypnotize the world with his dancing, hoping to conquer it and spread chaos.As far as dastardly plans go, even this one seems sort of... fun? And certainly not a scheme with any racial or religious hostility behind it. Clearly, Twitter knows something we don’t. As of press time, a user who appears to have adopted the @exampleuser1 handle after Twitter’s announcement simply stated, “I’m still here.”We’ve reached out to Nintendo as an expert character witness on Waluigi’s behalf and will, like Twitter, update you as our investigation unfolds.Update 1/10/18 4:22pm ET: Thoroughly tossing their second-most memorable villain under the bus, Nintendo’s only reply to Gizmodo was “we have nothing to announce on this topic.” Twitter might have been right to take action against Waluigi after all.",3.5
1127133,New Evidence Contradicts Theory That Easter Island Society Collapsed,"Easter Island statues, or moai.Image:  Dale Simpson Jr.The indigenous people of Easter Island, the Rapa Nui, experienced a societal collapse after the 17th century because they stripped the island clean of its natural resources. Or at least, that’s the leading theory. An analysis of the tools used by the Rapa Nui to build their iconic stone statues suggests a very different conclusion, pointing to the presence of a highly organized and cohesive society.Located 2,300 miles (3,700 km) west of Chile, Easter Island is one of the most remote places on Earth. The 66-square-mile (170-square-kilometer) island was first inhabited by a group of Pacific Islanders between 1,100 and 900 years ago, with these people forming the backbone of a civilization that would last for hundreds of years. The Rapa Nui people are famous, of course, for those stunning humanoid statues known as moai, the tallest of which measure 33 feet (10 meter) high and weigh upward of 81 tons.  At some point before the 1700s, however, this civilization experienced a collapse. The conventional theory is that the Rapa Nui people wiped the island clean of its trees, causing widespread erosion and food shortages, which in turn created civil strife and internal violence. Writing in the LA Times back in 2012, Thomas H. Maugh II said:UCLA anthropologist Jared Diamond famously detailed what the called the “ecocide” of Rapa Nui in his 2005 book “Collapse.” When Polynesians first settled the island about AD 800, they had the misfortune to select one that was dry, cool and remote—and thus poorly fertilized by windblown dust or volcanic ash. They chopped down forests to provide wood for construction and for moving the moai, and the trees didn’t return. The denuded landscape allowed winds to blow off the topsoil, and fertility fell sharply. When the natives no longer had wood for building fishing canoes, they killed and ate all the birds. Before the Dutch arrived at the island on Easter Sunday in 1722, the population had descended into cannibalism and barbarity. Diamond called it “the clearest example of a society that destroyed itself by over-exploiting its own resources.”New research published today in the Journal of Pacific Archaeology is now offering a different perspective, showing that the Rapa Nui people maintained a thriving tool-building industry during the time of their alleged descent into “barbarity.” Image:  Dale Simpson, Jr.“The idea of competition and collapse on Easter Island might be overstated,” Dale Simpson, Jr., the lead author of the paper and an archaeologist from the University of Queensland, said in a statement. “To me, the stone-carving industry is solid evidence that there was cooperation among families and craft groups.”To reach this conclusion, Simpson and his colleagues studied the stone quarries from which the Rapa Nui people collected their raw materials, namely volcanic basalt, to construct tools like picks, chisels, and toki, an axe-like implement. These tools were used to sculpt the moai sculptures and to carve canoes, among other things. The researchers also analyzed 17 tools selected from the 1,624 items recently excavated near the location of the moai statues. The researchers were trying to determine where the raw materials used to manufacture the artifacts came from, and to see if these people were extracting the material close to where they lived. To do so, the researchers cut off tiny pieces of stone from the toki using lasers, and used a mass spectrometer to analyze the different chemicals found within these samples. The chemical elements in these basalt samples were then compared to materials found within several other major quarries on the island.This analysis showed that the majority of the toki came from a single quarry complex known as Rano Raraku. This finding, the researchers say, would seem to suggest that everyone on the island was using one type of stone, which must have required collaboration. So rather than ripping each other to shreds, as per the popular narrative, the Rapa Nui people were cooperating and sharing information with each other. As the authors write in their paper:  [We] argue that [the] purposeful caching of toki and picks—including the 1,624 specimens recovered around [the moai statues] does not represent a dramatic abandonment of moai carving as has been proposed and linked to the island’s alleged ‘collapse,’ but instead highlights that [ancient statue carvers] were well organized and planned ahead by having a surplus of necessary materials on hand and ready to use making Rano Raraku a highly productive megalithic quarry; hence the production of ~1000 moai.Simpson and his colleagues believe it’s unlikely that the Rapa Nui civilization ran out of resources and fought amongst themselves to the point of extinction. “There’s so much mystery around Easter Island, because it’s so isolated, but on the island, people were, and still are, interacting in huge amounts,” said Simpson. This society was later decimated by colonists and slavery, he said, but Rapa Nui culture has managed to live on. “There are thousands of Rapa Nui people alive today—the society isn’t gone,” he said. Speaking to New Scientist, archaeologist Robert DiNapoli said the conclusion makes sense, and that “No particular clan seems to have control or differential access to these resources, so they must be cooperating in using them.” DiNapoli said it’s entirely possible that this society went from cooperation to conflict, but there’s “simply no archaeological evidence for large scale conflict among the Rapa Nui,” adding that “Nearly all evidence points to a relatively peaceful society throughout prehistory.”Needless to say, more archaeological evidence is needed to paint a clearer picture of this civilization and the reasons for its eventual demise. Revealingly, the researchers admit that their interpretation needs to be viewed with caution.“The near exclusive use of one quarry to produce these 17 tools supports a view of craft specialization based on information exchange, but we can’t know at this stage if the interaction was collaborative,” said Jo Anne Van Tilburg, a co-author of the new study and a researcher at the University of California. “It may also have been coercive in some way. Human behavior is complex. This study encourages further mapping and stone sourcing, and our excavations continue to shed new light on moai carving.”[Journal of Pacific Archaeology]",4.5
1127714,This Wireless Charging Backup Battery Is a Wonderfully Convenient Upgrade,"Photo:  Andrew Liszewski (Gizmodo)Aside from making them smaller, boosting their capacities, or adding more ports, there’s not much room to innovate when it comes to backup batteries. But Avido’s new WiBa power bank manages to squeeze wireless charging into a portable power source that’s so convenient, it now goes everywhere my smartphone does.Other GadgetsOther GadgetsWiBa Wireless Power Bank & Charging PadOther GadgetsWiBa Wireless Power Bank & Charging PadWiBa Wireless Power Bank & Charging PadWHAT IS IT?A portable backup battery with a built-in induction charger so wires aren't needed.PRICE$99LIKEGoodbye charging cables.DISLIKEAlways-on power LEDs are bright and annoying at night.If you’re a heavy smartphone user who lives on Facebook, posts endlessly to Instagram, and can’t seem to break a Candy Crush addiction, you probably also spend a lot of time stressing over your battery life. Memorizing the location of every available power outlet in your office and along your daily commute is one solution, but an easier option is to just keep a backup battery on hand.They’re available in countless shapes, sizes, and capacities, but their functionality is basically all the same: you tether your smartphone to the power bank’s USB port, and your stresses about your phone dying disappear. Their portability makes them infinitely more convenient than finding a power outlet, but there’s still that cord you have to wrangle—and remember to bring.If you’ve upgraded to a smartphone that supports wireless charging, you might already be familiar with the convenience and freedom of simply dropping your smartphone on a charging pad when it needs a top up, and then easily snatching it back when you’ve got a message to check. Plugging and unplugging a physical cable feels so 2014. The WiBa takes that freedom one step further, untethering the wireless charging pad as well so that convenience can follow you anywhere.The power bank charges on the pad using a series of metal pins instead of wireless power transfer.Photo:  Andrew Liszewski (Gizmodo)There are two parts to the WiBa charging system: a portable power bank and a charging pad. They can each wirelessly charge devices that support that functionality (I tested the system with the iPhone 8) but when the WiBa battery is stacked on the pad for charging, it actually relies on a set of physical pins to transfer power. Presumably this is to keep the battery on the thinner side, as having the wireless charging hardware on both sides of it would have added some unwanted bulk and weight. But those metal pins on the charging pad don’t prevent you from placing a smartphone on there; they’re spring-loaded and simply retract under the weight of your device.The power bank also offers a standard USB port for powering devices that don’t support wireless charging. And it can be topped off using a USB-C cable.Photo:  Andrew Liszewski (Gizmodo)You can also charge the WiBa power bank using a USB-C cable should you find it’s low on juice and you’re no where near its wireless charging pad, while a standard USB port makes the power bank’s 5,000 mAh battery available to virtually any device that can be charged over USB.Just sidle your smartphone up to the WiBa battery, and it will start charging. Easy-peasy.Photo:  Andrew Liszewski (Gizmodo)It’s not a wireless charging-only solution, but I can’t see myself using the WiBa for anything other than that. I work from home, and tend to move from room to room depending on what I’m doing, and being able to easily carry a wireless charging solution wherever I go is just brilliant. My smartphone is also my primary office phone, and even just a couple of quick calls can take a toll on its battery. Knowing that it’s perpetually being charged back up every time I plop it down on this battery far outweighs the downsides of the WiBa power bank for me.When the WiBa battery is sitting on the charging pad, that power light never goes off.Photo:  Andrew Liszewski (Gizmodo)So what don’t I like about the WiBa? For starters, the power bank’s status and charging LEDs remain perpetually lit while it’s sitting on the charging pad, which I keep near my bed. I’ve long outgrown the need for a nightlight, which means I’ll probably be reaching for the electrical tape at some point to deal with those incessant LEDs. The power bank also isn’t the most compact 5,000 mAh portable charger you can get, but its flat, smartphone-shaped design is still easy to carry around.Four LEDs illuminate to indicate the WiBa battery’s remaining power reserve.Photo:  Andrew Liszewski (Gizmodo)Wireless charging requires a fairly precise alignment of the induction coils hidden inside each device, so wirelessly charging your smartphone on the WiBa power bank while on-the-go just isn’t going to happen—unless you carefully hold both of them in your hand the entire time. (Nope.) There’s also the issue of charging speed. The tethered WiBa charging pad manages to muster 10-watts of output, which is comparable to the 12-watt wall wart that comes with the iPad Pro, but the WiBa battery is limited to just 5-watts. That’s not the end of the world, Apple’s tiny iPhone chargers have the same wattage, but it means that when sitting on the WiBa power bank, your phone isn’t going to charge as quickly as it could.The WiBa’s white, matte finish is lovely, but I worry it will quickly get dirty.Photo:  Andrew Liszewski (Gizmodo)The WiBa power bank might not be the perfect portable charging solution for everyone—but it’s the perfect one for me. Its best feature is simply convenience, making it easier to ensure my phone is always topped off throughout the day, while eliminating another cable from the rat’s nest on my desk. The benefits of its wireless functionality far outweigh the  compromises imposed by the inclusion of the wireless charging coil. I’m not sure I’d ever buy a power bank without wireless charging capabilities ever again.READMEAt $99 the WiBa system isn’t cheap; you can get a wireless charger plus a tethered backup battery for much less.You can charge your phone and the power bank at the same time when all are stacked on the charging pad.5,000 mAh is enough power to revive a smartphone, but not to fully charge most tablets.LED charging and status lights never turn off while the power bank is sitting on its charging pad, which is a problem at night.The power bank won’t wirelessly charge your smartphone as quickly as some corded chargers are able to.",4.0

There’s local anonymity, where your browsing isn’t recorded on your device but can be logged by sites and advertisers; then there’s tracking anonymity, where sites and advertisers are prevented from following you across the web.VPN services focus on a different kind of privacy at the level of actually connecting to the web—making your browsing more private and less easy to eavesdrop on, without actually making you anonymous. We’ve covered all these different areas below.Just bear in mind that it’s difficult to stay truly anonymous if you need to sign into services on the web, from Amazon to Facebook. You can limit how much data gets collected on you by these sites to some extent, but they’re going to know that you logged in and what you did while you were online, no matter how many safeguards you put up.Fire up incognito modeIncognito and private mode can protect you... up to a point.Screenshot:  GizmodoFor a quick and easy way to make your mobile browsing more private, fire up incognito or browser mode: It’s New Incognito Tab on the Chrome menu on Android, and Private on the tabs overview screen on Safari on iOS. Your search and browsing history, and all the cookies you’ve collected, get erased when the tab is closed.This mode doesn’t make you completely anonymous—your internet service provider will still be able to monitor what you’re doing if you’re connected to its network, so use it as a quick and easy method of avoiding leaving a trace on your phone or tablet. And don’t sign in anywhere either, as that kind of defeats the purpose of incognito mode.Sign into Google and it’s going to know what you’re searching for and what you’re looking at.

Like its desktop counterpart, it’s been developed specifically with privacy and security in mind. The Tor Project is dedicated to enabling online anonymity, routing your traffic through encrypted connections and its own servers, and making it very hard for anyone else to keep tabs on you.It also severely restricts the sort of background scripts that advertisers and data collectors love—cookies are isolated and removed after each browsing session, third-party trackers (monitoring you over multiple sites) get blocked, and it takes steps to prevent sites from identifying you via your device and browser information too.The Tor Browser is by no means the only privacy-focused browser on the Android and iOS app stores. Brave (Android, iOS) is specifically designed to block advertisements and advertising tracking, leaving you with a clean and lean browsing experience. Like Tor, it stops cross-site tracking and device fingerprinting, which can be used to identify you even if you’re not signed in anywhere.Brave is another option for the privacy-conscious.Screenshot:  GizmodoYou also get the same private browsing mode available in other browsers, a setting to force HTTPS connections wherever possible (which is more secure than HTTP), and features to save on battery and data usage as well. Just tap the Brave icon in the toolbar to control what is and isn’t allowed on a site (you might want to consider allowing ads on sites you like and want to support).Privacy-centric search engine DuckDuckGo makes its own browser for Android and iOS which takes the same approach as Brave—though with DuckDuckGo as your default search engine rather than Google. Another neat trick is the way it gives each site you visit a privacy grade rating, so you can see at a glance just how eager certain sites (and their advertisers) are to track you.We should also mention Firefox Focus (Android, iOS), which goes above and beyond the standard Firefox to automatically block ads and web trackers, as well as giving you easy options for erasing your browsing history (or not letting it build up in the first place). It’s not quite as comprehensive as the other browsers we’ve mentioned, but it’s really simple to use.Install a VPNThese days, Android and iOS are set up to handle VPNs with the minimum of fuss.Screenshot:  GizmodoFor extra protection against anyone who might be snooping on your online activities—from coffee shop hackers to the local authorities—get a VPN (Virtual Private Network) installed on your phone or tablet. Remember VPNs focus primarily on disguising your browsing and location from the outside world, and for best results in regards to anonymity (in terms of ads and web trackers) you really need to use them alongside the other methods we’ve mentioned.You’ve got a whole host of free and paid for options to pick from: We won’t go into a full buyer’s guide here but it’s always worth paying for better service. If you only occasionally need to anonymize your browsing then TunnelBear, Windscribe, and Hotspot Shield all offer widely recommended and free (if limited) VPN services for mobile.VPNs are even easier to configure on mobile than they are on the desktop: The relevant screens are under General and VPN in iOS Settings, and under Network & Internet and VPN in Android Settings. Most apps will take you step-by-step through the installation process, and with the VPN up and running, you can use whichever browser you prefer to navigate the web.",4.0
1134607,HackerOne Reveals Which Security Bugs Are Making Its Army of Hackers the Most Bank,"A laptop is standing on a table during the Chaos Communication Congress, an annual hacker conference held in Germany. Photo:  Jens Schlueter / GettyAs far back as 2015, major companies like Sony and Intel have sought to crowdsource efforts to secure their systems and applications through the San Francisco startup HackerOne. Through the  “bug bounty” program offered by the company, hackers once viewed as a nuisance—or worse, as criminals—can identify security vulnerabilities and get paid for their work.On Tuesday, HackerOne published a wealth of anonymized data to underscore not only the breadth of its own program but highlight the leading types of bugs discovered by its virtual army of hackers who’ve reaped financial rewards through the program. Some $29 million has been paid out so far with regards to the top 10 most rewarded types of security weakness alone, according to the company. HackerOne markets the bounty program as a means to safely mimic an authentic kind of global threat. “It’s one of the best defenses you can have against what you’re actually protecting against,” said Miju Han, HackerOne’s director of product management. “There are a lot of security tools out there that have theoretically risks—and we definitely endorse those tools as well. But what we really have in bug bounty programs is a real-world security risk.”The program, of course, has its own limitations. Participants have the ability to define the scope of engagement and in some cases—as with the U.S. Defense Department, a “hackable target”—place limits on which systems and methods are authorized under the program. Criminal hackers and foreign adversaries  are, of course, not bound by such rules. Graphic:  HackerOne“Bug bounties can be a helpful tool if you’ve already invested in your own security prevention and detection,” said Katie Moussouris, CEO of Luta Security, “in terms of secure development if you publish code, or secure vulnerability management if your organization is mostly just trying to keep up with patching existing infrastructure.”“It isn’t suitable to replace your own preventative measures, nor can it replace penetration testing,” she said.Not surprisingly, HackerOne’s data shows that overwhelmingly cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks—in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise trusted sites—remain the top vulnerability reported through the program. Of the top 10 types of bugs reported, XSS makes up 27 percent. No other type of bug comes close. Through HackerOne, some $7.7 million has been paid out to address XSS vulnerabilities alone. Cloud migration has also led to a rise in exploits such as server-side request forgery (SSRF). “The attacker can supply or modify a URL which the code running on the server will read or submit data to, and by carefully selecting the URLs, the attacker may be able to read server configuration such as AWS metadata, connect to internal services like http-enabled databases or perform post requests towards internal services which are not intended to be exposed,” HackerOne said. Currently, SSRF makes up only 5.9 percent of the top bugs reported. Nevertheless, the company says, these server-side exploits are trending upward as more and more companies find homes in the cloud.Other top bounties include a range of code injection exploits or misconfigurations that allow improper access to systems that should be locked down. Companies have paid out over $1.5 million alone to address improper access control. “Companies that pay more for bounties are definitely more attractive to hackers, especially more attractive to top hackers,” Han said. “But we know that bounties paid out are not the only motivation. Hackers like to hack companies that they like using, or that are located in their country.” In other words, even though a company is spending more money to pay hackers to find bugs, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they have more security. “Another factor is how fast a company is changing,” she said. “If a company is developing very rapidly and expanding and growing, even if they pay a lot of bounties, if they’re changing up their code base a lot, then that means they are not necessary as secure.”According to an article this year in TechRepublic, some 300,000 hackers are currently signed up with HackerOne; though only 1-in-10 have reportedly claimed a bounty. The best of them, a group of roughly 100 hackers, have earned over $100,000. Only a couple of elite hackers have attained the highest-paying ranks of the program, reaping rewards close to, or in excess of, $1 million.

President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on June 1 ratified the long-delayed investment law aimed at making business easier and creating incentives to lure back investors after years of turmoil, but investors are waiting for more details before rushing back in. The new law is expected to boost badly needed investment by cutting bureaucracy, especially for starting projects, and providing more incentives to investors looking to put money into Egypt.

Meituan-Dianping in a statement said the round was led by existing investor Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK), with participants including Sequoia Capital Ltd, Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd [GIC.UL] and Tiger Global Management LLC. Reuters reported in August that Meituan-Dianping was considering raising up to $5 billion. Earlier this year, Meituan-Dianping announced plans to invest in offline services and artificial intelligence technology (AI), amid a push by China’s top tech firms into brick-and-mortar retail. Often compared to services from Yelp Inc (YELP.N) and Groupon Inc (GRPN.O), Meituan-Dianping is an online platform for a range of services including movie ticketing, food delivery, restaurant bookings, beauty services, travel and luxury goods. Its biggest rivals include e-commerce pair Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) and JD.com Inc (JD.O), both of which have championed a shift into offline stores in recent years, spurred by developments in cloud computing and big data technology. Meituan-Dianping’s plans include opening a chain of offline stores, beginning in Beijing earlier this year, as well as developing technology in logistics and AI. In July, Meituan-Dianping’s vice-president of strategy told Reuters the firm was not considering an initial public offering until it had established infrastructure for services including offline retail, and had roughly $3 billion in cash reserves remaining from a previous funding round. Meituan-Dianping said it has 280 million users and serves as a platform for roughly 5 million businesses. Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Christopher Cushing",3.5

1155239,"Chinese cyber spies broaden attacks in Vietnam, security firm says","(Reuters) - Cyber spies working for or on behalf of China’s government have broadened attacks against official and corporate targets in Vietnam at a time of raised tension over the South China Sea, cyber security company FireEye said. FireEye told Reuters the attacks happened in recent weeks and it had traced them back to suspected Chinese cyber spies based partly on the fact that a Chinese group it had identified previously had used the same infrastructure before. “Where China has often focused on the government before, this shows they are really hitting the full commercial sector potentially in Vietnam and trying to gather a broad base of information there,” said Ben Read, who heads FireEye’s cyber espionage team. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China opposed all forms of illegal internet activities or stealing of secrets and also opposed any accusations from any side against any country on the issue without cast-iron proof. Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said cyber attacks should be severely punished in accordance with the law and that it was important for countries to secure their networks. Vietnam denies allowing cyber espionage although it has also been accused by FireEye of carrying out attacks. Tension between China and neighboring Vietnam is at its highest in three years over the disputed South China Sea, where Vietnam has emerged as the most vocal opponents of Beijing’s extensive claims. Vietnam suspended oil drilling in offshore waters that are also claimed by China in July under pressure from Beijing. China has appeared uneasy at Vietnam’s efforts to rally Southeast Asian countries over the South China Sea as well as at its growing defense relationships with the United States, Japan and India. China claims nearly all the South China Sea, through which an estimated $3 trillion in international trade passes each year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan also have claims. FireEye said the attacks in Vietnam involved sending users documents in Vietnamese which appeared to be requests for financial information. A broad range of companies appeared to have been targeted, including financial institutions, it said without giving specific details. When the user opened them, they delivered malware which could infect a computer and send back information to the cyber spies, potentially letting them into the computer network too. FireEye linked the attacks to a team it calls Conimes because in the past it used the conimes.com domain. The team focuses on Southeast Asia, but its main target is Vietnam and even more so since tensions rose over the South China Sea, Read said. He was unable to say exactly what information had been gathered. Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang called earlier this month for tighter Internet controls to provide better protection against cyber threats as well as to prevent websites and social media publishing material damaging to the communist party. Read said the attacks it had discovered on Vietnam were relatively unsophisticated and relied on users having pre-2012 versions of Microsoft Word. “They are using comparatively simple techniques because apparently they work,” he said.

Smith, a transfer from Illinois, was 5-for-7 on 3-point attempts while his teammates were just 3-for-18. Jeremiah Tilmon added 14 points for the Tigers, who are coming off a 20-win season in which they were one of the most improved teams in the country. They won their opener for the fourth consecutive season and the 12th time in 13 seasons. Eddy Kayouloud came off the Central Arkansas bench to score 19 points, making 4 of 8 3-point tries. DeAndre Jones scored 12 for the Bears, who are coming off an 18-win season, their best total since joining the NCAA Division I in 2006-07. Central Arkansas returns 10 players from that team, but that group does not include record-setting guard Jordan Howard, four-year starter Mathieu Kamba and another senior from last season, Ethan Lee. Smith made two 3-pointers at the start of the second half as the Tigers increased their 30-20 halftime lead to 40-23. The Bears cut into the deficit as Tanner Schmit’s two 3-pointers helped them climb within 42-31. Kayouloud made two layups as Central Arkansas crept within 46-39. However, Missouri got inside for three consecutive layups during an 11-1 run that gave the Tigers a 57-40 lead with eight minutes remaining. The Bears could not get the deficit to fewer than 10 points after that. They wound up shooting a higher rate on 3-point tries (37 percent) than they did on field-goal attempts overall (31 percent). The Tigers got off to a blistering start from the outside. Smith made three 3-pointers as they opened an early 18-5 lead. The Bears started chipping away, and Jones’ 3-pointer pulled them within 20-16.

1161731,Financial Times hopes faster website will boost readership,"(Reuters) - Financial Times, one of the pioneers of charging for digital content, is betting that speeding up its website FT.com will help it retain and grow online readership, Chief Executive Officer John Ridding told Reuters. The London-based publication, which is expected to unveil its new website Tuesday, has halved the time it takes a story to load on desktop to slightly over one second. Mobile devices can now load a story in a little over 2 seconds, down from 6 seconds. FT hopes boosting the speed of its site and adding more personalization will help it retain and grow its digital subscriber base at a time when more people are accessing news content online for free. FT has found that readers are 5 percent more engaged in the site when the time it takes to load an article is reduced by just one second, Ridding said in an interview on Friday. Financial Times is launching the faster digital site at a time when readers are increasingly going online for content, often to other platforms like Facebook Inc. Ridding said Financial Times, like many publications, must balance working with social media sites to raise awareness of its content with making sure it has a direct relationship with readers and access to the data around their viewing patterns. To that end, FT posts article on Facebook, but is not part of that site’s Instant Articles news offering. “It’s a great marketing opportunity,” Ridding said of platforms like Facebook. “But established publishers have to be careful of being disintermediated from their audience.” Financial Times has more than 800,000 subscriptions, two-thirds of which are digital. “We have had double digit growth year over year,” Ridding said. At the same time, revenue from advertising versus subscriptions has flipped over the past six years. “In 2010, well over half of (overall) revenue was advertising,” Ridding said. Now that is closer to 40 percent, with 60 percent coming from subscriptions. In an effort to boost advertising, Financial Times has started focusing more on charging advertisers based on how much time readers spend on their ads as opposed to how many people clicked through an ad. Ridding said FT can also inform advertisers about specific segments of readers, such as board members or German business travelers, who viewed and ad for a specific period of time.

The family of lawyer Enrique Aristeguieta and the political party Justice First said he was taken from his home in Caracas in the early hours of Friday, with no explanation from authorities. “Full freedom for Enrique Aristeguieta and we’ll also achieve that for Venezuela,” said hard-line opposition leader Maria Corina Machado. Aristeguieta is an outspoken opposition campaigner who regularly compares what he calls the “narco-tyranny” of socialist President Nicolas Maduro to the 1952-1958 dictatorship of Marcos Perez. Aristeguieta’s Twitter feed had not yet been updated and the last message posted at about 4 a.m. Friday said he was being sought by Venezuelan intelligence agents in his home. Authorities did not respond to a request for comment earlier on Friday on the detention. Local rights group Penal Forum said Aristeguieta was one of 14 activists rounded up during the past week, among about 200 who are being detained by the Maduro government. Critics say the ruling Socialist Party persecutes dissenters while officials insist they are acting legitimately against people plotting against the government with U.S. support.

1171432,Felix fixes formula for rare 200-400m Olympic bid,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Allyson Felix is honing in on her quest for a rare shot at gold in both the 200 and 400 meters at the Rio Olympics, tailoring her training to simulate the stress of her bid and leaning some who have achieved the feat. A four-time Olympic champion and nine-time world champion in the sprints, Felix is seeking to become only the fourth athlete to sweep the distances at an Olympics. Felix, in New York to compete in the 60-yard dash indoors at the Armory in Saturday’s 109th Millrose Games, attempted the feat at the 2011 world championships where she finished second in the 400 meters and third in the 200 meters. “It was a huge learning experience for me because it was my first time trying to do it,” Felix, 30, told Reuters on Thursday. “I learned that I needed more speed. When I came to the 200 I was feeling flat, and not like myself.” Felix said her sprinting speed is her strength and she must have faith that her distance training would provide the endurance she needs in the 400 to match Valerie Brisco-Hooks (1984) and France’s Marie-Jose Perec (1996). Michael Johnson became the first men’s 200-400 double winner at the 1996 Atlanta Games. “Obviously, (her coach) Bobby (Kersee) has been my biggest wisdom in the area and Valerie, she’s someone who I’ll continue to talk to. She’s worked with us for years,” said Felix, whose coach Kersee worked with Brisco-Hooks at the LA Games. “I have a great relationship with her. I’ve picked her brain a little bit, and I’m definitely going to continue to do that throughout the year.” An Olympic schedule change has provided more time between the races in Rio this year but the reigning 200m champion said she needs to work on quick turnarounds for the Summer Games should she qualify to represent the U.S. in both distances. “Training is going well. It’s intense and it’s heavy right now,” Felix said. “A lot of running with very short recovery and two races overlapping. Just being able to do that workload in practice and have that turnaround is the biggest difference. “It’s about having intense days back-to-back. I think one of the biggest concerns is that there is a late night (400) semi-final, (followed by) an early morning 200 round and late night (400) final. “So being able to kind of simulate that in practice that’s a big thing,” she said, adding that late night workouts were in the master plan. Felix said an encounter with Johnson at last October’s Hall of Fame induction in the Armory further motivated her. “He was just saying he wanted me to go for it and was interested as a fan of track and field to see the outcome,” beamed Felix. “Of course, he’s a huge inspiration.” Editing by Frank Pingue",3.0

U.S. oil exports may rise to about 4 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2022, a four-fold jump from this year, said Brent Secrest, a senior vice president at Enterprise Products. During that same period, global oil demand, excluding the U.S., may rise to as much as 73 million bpd, up from 65 million bpd currently, he said. Demand for light, low-sulfur, or sweet, crude is set to rise as countries push refiners to produce cleaner fuels, as highlighted by the Internationals Maritime Organization’s (IMO) new rules to cut the sulfur content in the fuel used in large container ships, or bunker fuel, by 2020. “The (crude oil) barrels have to clear across the water ... To the demand in Asia, to the demand in Europe,” he told an industry event in Singapore. U.S. crude oil production has spiked following the higher output of low-sulfur crude from shale formations since the late-2000s, causing a glut in domestic crude supplies. U.S. refiners, however, are geared toward processing denser oil with a higher sulfur content. Enterprise currently exports around 100,000 bpd of crude oil from the U.S. Gulf Coast, Secrest said. To ramp up exports, the company plans to increase the loading rates at the Enterprise Houston Midland terminal by the first quarter of 2018 and is looking at stabilizing the quality of Domestic Sweet crude (DSW) exports from its Seaway terminal, he said. More U.S. oil exports are also expected as U.S. refiners will not change their configurations to accommodate domestic light, sweet crude oil, Secrest added. The change in the bunker fuel specifications will also boost the U.S. export demand, he said. The IMO tightened the sulfur requirement for bunker fuels in October to a maximum of 0.5 percent from the current maximum of 3.5 percent. Refiners and the shipping sector have not decided how to meet the stricter standards amid a myriad of solutions that include switching to gasoil or installing scrubbers to remove sulfur emissions from ships. “(The) solution is light sweet crude oil that we have to offer, Secrest said.

1183883,New economy investor China Renaissance raises $1 billion for latest yuan fund,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - China Renaissance Holdings Ltd (1911.HK) said it has raised over 6.5 billion yuan ($945 million) for its latest yuan-denominated fund, as the investment bank prepares to invest further in sunrise industries in the world’s second-largest economy. The firm in a statement on Monday said its private equity arm Huaxing Growth Capital had raised its third yuan fund totaling over 6.5 billion yuan, with over-subscription of more than 1 billion yuan. The fund has secured “great interest” from investors, known as limited partners (LPs), such as China’s National Social Security Fund, banks, insurers, funds-of-funds and university alumni funds, it said. China Renaissance is a major player in the country’s buoyant technology sector and has advised on top deals including the formation of ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing. The investment bank in recent years has looked to push beyond its core merger-and-acquisition advisory and securities underwriting business and sharpen focus on areas including investment management. Its Huaxing Growth Capital unit joins several China-focused private equity and venture capital managers which have managed to raise fresh capital to cut deals in the country in the face of tighter liquidity amid Sino-U.S. trade tension and the government’s war on debt. Launched in 2013, the Beijing-based arm which had about $4.1 billion worth of assets under management as at the end of 2018, will focus the new fund on areas including technology, consumption, new energy and advanced manufacturing, it said in the same statement. The unit currently manages three yuan-denominated funds and another three U.S. dollar funds. It has invested in over 90 firms across new economy sectors, of which 19 have gone public, including online food delivery-to-ticketing firm Meituan Dianping (3690.HK) and medical tech platform WuXi AppTec Co Ltd (603259.SS).

1186556,GE lifts forecast but warns Boeing grounding may cost $1.4 billion,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) raised its 2019 forecast on Wednesday, but disclosed more than $1 billion in potential costs from Boeing’s grounded 737 MAX jetliner, puncturing an early share rally. Boston-based GE, which makes 737 MAX engines in a joint venture, also said Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller, who was appointed in October 2017, plans to step down after a successor is hired. The company which also makes power plants and medical devices did not specify a time frame. GE appeared to cheer investors by saying it might generate as much as $1 billion in free cash flow this year, compared with a potential outflow of $2 billion that it forecast in May. GE also raised its profit outlook by 5 cents a share. “There should be some relief from the raised EPS and free cash flow” forecast, Barclays analyst Julian Mitchell said. But GE’s portfolio of low-margin industrial businesses remains a concern. GE posted red ink again after two profitable quarters, due mainly to a $744-million goodwill charge for its power grid business. GE spent less on restructuring than analysts expected, which underpinned its performance. GE also received a tax benefit worth 6 cents a share that more than accounted for its increased profit forecast. “The EPS increase of 5 cents ... is less than this quarter’s 6-cent tax benefit,” Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch said in a note. The cash flow increase “appears to be heavily driven by ... reduced cash restructuring drag,” he added. After surging 4% in premarket trading, GE shares fell less than 1% to $10.45. Graphic: GE shares under CEO Culp - tmsnrt.rs/2yqnVjR GE’s industrial businesses suffered another tough three months, with margins falling by as much as 8 percentage points at renewable energy. But they generated more cash than expected, in part because it has become more aggressive in billing customers, collecting payments and reducing inventory, Chief Executive Larry Culp said on a conference call. GE’s power business, which has long been a drag on earnings, posted a $117-million profit. But its relatively strong aviation business suffered as problems stretched on with Boeing’s 737 MAX jetliner, which regulators grounded in March. CFM International, a joint venture between GE and France’s Safran SA (SAF.PA), supplies engines for the 737 MAX. The MAX could cost GE $1.4 billion in cash if the plane remains grounded all year, as now appears possible, GE said. “That was not in the previous guidance,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray, who added that investors reacted by selling GE after the conference call. But airlines will fly older planes in place of the MAX and those use more spare parts, a lucrative product line for GE, Dray said. “We have to believe GE has ample contingency in their free cash flow outlook to have taken a bold, unexpected step to increase guidance,” Dray said. “No one was expecting them to.” Investors have watched GE’s cash generation as it has failed to keep pace with earnings in recent years, raising concerns that GE’s actual financial performance was falling short of stated results. But in May Culp said he would focus on generating cash and let earnings be “almost like a byproduct,” Dray said. GE said it now expects higher industrial revenue growth and bumped up earnings per share by 5 cents to between 55 cents and 65 cents. It shifted its forecast for industrial free cash flow to between negative $1 billion and positive $1 billion, from $0 to negative $2 billion. Loss per share from continuing operations was 3 cents, down from a profit of 8 cents a year ago. On an adjusted basis, GE earned 17 cents per share, including the tax gain, compared with analysts estimates of 12 cents, on average, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue fell 1.1% to $28.8 billion. Reporting by Alwyn Scott in New York and Rachit Vats and Sanjana Shivdas in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham, Nick Zieminski and Tom Brown",4.0
1186640,"Mazda first-quarter profit disappoints, hurt by weak U.S., China sales","TOKYO (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp (7261.T) reported a 79% drop in quarterly operating profit, falling significantly short of estimates, as it continues to struggle with declining U.S. and Chinese sales, while a strengthening yen also cut into its bottom line. Operating profit at Japan’s No.5 automaker was 7.0 billion yen ($64 million) in the first quarter ended June, versus around 33 billion yen a year ago and less than half of an average forecast for 18.5 billion yen from analysts polled by Refinitiv. Mazda, however, reiterated its forecast for a 33% rise in operating profit to 110 billion yen in the year ending March. Thursday’s profit announcement marks Mazda’s poorest first-quarter operating performance since the June 2012 quarter. The automaker has been struggling with falling demand for its cars over the past year or so, while it is also recovering from flood-related damage to its factories in Japan that led to a quarterly loss in the July quarter of 2018. The Nikkei business daily on Wednesday had reported that operating profit at the company would fall around 70% for the quarter due to lower sales in the United States. Mazda posted global sales of 353,000 units for the quarter, down 12% from a year ago. Its sales in the United States, its biggest market, fell 15% to 68,000 units, while in China, Mazda sold 54,000 vehicles, down 21% on the year. A trade war between the top two economies and slowing growth in China, the world’s biggest auto market, have prompted a broad-based sales downturn in the global auto sector. Automakers are grappling with easing demand for cars just as they must invest heavily in new technologies including electric cars, autonomous driving technologies and ride-sharing services to survive a major industry shift away from car ownership. Many of Mazda’s rivals at home and abroad have been reporting disappointing quarterly results, with Nissan (7201.T) and Ford (F.N) also announcing job cuts and possible plant closures earlier this month. For a link to an interactive graph on Mazda's operating profit, click on tmsnrt.rs/313WKYp The United States is a key source of revenue for Mazda, but it imports all its vehicles sold there, exposing it to a threatened hike in U.S. tariffs on imported cars from Japan.

SANTIAGO, April 18 (Reuters) - Chile’s Cochilco state copper commission on Thursday held its estimate for the price of copper at $3.05 per pound, rising to $3.08 for 2020 on improving prospects for growth in China. The price, it said, would be underpinned by a 208,000 tonne deficit in the global market for 2019. The deficit is expected to drop slightly to 202,000 tonnes in 2020. Cochilco said production this year in Chile, the world’s top copper producer, would increase 2.2 percent over 2018 to 5.96 million tonnes. Output in 2020 is expected to hit 6.21 million tonnes, the agency said. Mining Minister Baldo Prokurica told reporters at a press conference in Santiago that he did not foresee any further disruptions to production this year in the Andean nation, adding that he expected pending contract negotiations at mines in Chile “would end well.” Unusually heavy rains and flooding in the Atacama desert in February docked production at many of the country’s top copper and lithium mines.

1195798,Whistleblower lawyers to Grassley: Make Barr commit to False Claims cases,"(Reuters) - A coalition of academics, public interest groups and lawyers who represent whistleblowers sent a letter Thursday to outgoing U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, calling on the Iowa Republican to protect one of his own signature pieces of legislation, the False Claims Act, when Attorney General nominee William Barr comes before the Senate later this month in confirmation hearings. As I reported Wednesday, Barr has previously called the FCA, which offers a bounty to private whistleblowers who file fraud suits on behalf of the U.S. government, an unconstitutional “abomination.” As the head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel in 1989 – three years after Senator Grassley and others in Congress overhauled the FCA to spark prosecution of fraud against the U.S., Barr wrote an opinion highlighting what he considered to be constitutional violations in the law’s whistleblower provisions. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected some constitutional challenges to the FCA in a unanimous ruling in 2000, but Barr said in 2001 that he still considered the law unconstitutional. Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast. “I felt then, and feel now, that is an abomination and a violation of the appointments clause under the due powers of the president,” Barr told interviewers from the University of Virginia, who were compiling an oral history of George H.W. Bush’s presidency. Barr said in the 2001 interview he wanted the Bush Justice Department to attack the constitutionality of the FCA but was opposed by then-Solicitor General Kenneth Starr. A source close to Barr’s confirmation process told me Wednesday that the AG nominee will back down from that view when he goes before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Jan. 15. “Barr has recently told others that his prior comments are outdated,” the source said. “He believes the Department of Justice’s current approach to the False Claims Act is sufficient to protect federal interests and that a constitutional challenge would not be warranted.” But one of the lawyers who organized the letter sent to Grassley on Thursday said it’s not enough for the AG nominee to promise not to challenge the FCA’s private whistleblower provisions. “The issue is whether he is going to support anti-fraud cases,” said Reuben Guttman of Guttman Buschner & Brooks. ”There are a ton of ways the Justice Department can put fingers on the scale to tip the balance.” Guttman and his fellow signators - including former U.S. District Judges Nancy Gertner and Michael Burrage, former South Carolina U.S. Attorney Bill Nettles and Government Accountability Project legal director Tom Devine - asked Senator Grassley to press Barr about his past views of the FCA, including his description of the law as an abomination. The AG nominee, they said, must “be called upon to commit the resources necessary at both the local and national levels to ensure vigorous and complete enforcement of the False Claims Act should he be confirmed.” Guttman told me the letter writers deliberately avoided inflammatory language and tone. “We wanted to be honest brokers, to say, Senator Grassley, we know you care about this issue,” Guttman said. “The letter is to set the issue up for continued oversight.” Other whistleblower lawyers have been more strident about Barr’s nomination. Stephen Kohn of Kohn Kohn & Colapinto, who said in an alert for the National Whistleblower Center that Barr has shown “extreme animus and hostility” to whistleblowers, told me the nominee should not be confirmed unless he repudiates his old views. “I would hope the Judiciary Committee questions him very aggressively,” Kohn said. “If he does not defend qui tam relators and renounce his previous position he is not fit to be attorney general.” Grassley, who is expected to cede chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee to Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, has championed the FCA for more than 30 years. In a 2018 speech on the Senate floor, Grassley called the statute “the most effective tool the government has” to protect taxpayers from fraud. The Justice Department recovered nearly $3 billion last year in FCA settlements and judgments. Since the Civil War-era law was overhauled in 1986, the government has won nearly $60 billion from defendants whose frauds were revealed by private whistleblowers suing on its behalf. The big worry for whistleblower lawyers is that a Barr-led Justice Department can quietly muzzle the FCA without a splashy constitutional challenge. When private citizens file an FCA suit alleging government fraud, the case is filed under seal to give the Justice Department an opportunity to investigate the whistleblower’s allegations. At the end of that investigation, DOJ can decide to intervene in the case, which is then largely prosecuted by the government, or to decline to intervene. Historically, DOJ has generally allowed private whistleblowers to continue to litigate FCA cases even if the government chooses not to pursue them. The FCA requires the Justice Department to sign off on all FCA dismissals and settlements, even in cases in which DOJ has not intervened. So one way for the Justice Department to slow FCA litigation, say whistleblower lawyers, would be to decline to intervene in good cases. Another would be to call for the dismissal of cases in which it has decided not to get involved. The Justice Department, said FCA defense lawyer Alex Hontos of Dorsey & Whitney, has already indicated a more aggressive stance on such cases in a 2018 memo from Civil Fraud Section Director Michael Granston. Under Barr, Hontos said, the Granston framework could be even more rigorously enforced. Or DOJ could quietly refuse to defend the FCA in cases in which it has declined to take over the prosecution of fraud claims. In the past, Kohn said, DOJ has intervened when FCA defendants attack the law itself. In 2018, for instance, Justice Department lawyers submitted a strongly-worded brief at the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (2018 WL 780484), rejecting an FCA defendant’s arguments that separation of powers doctrine bars private whistleblowers from proceeding when DOJ declines to pursue their claims. (The 10th Circuit ended up ducking the constitutional issue because the defendant failed to raise it in the trial court.) Guttman said that the Justice Department stepped in as an amicus twice in a Medicare fraud case his firm brought against the pharmaceutical company Celgene even though DOJ had declined to take up the case. With those crucial boosts from government lawyers, Guttman said, the case ended with a $280 million settlement in 2017. About $200 million of that went to the U.S. government. “A hostile Justice Department,” Kohn said, “would destroy the practical use of the law.” A spokesman for Grassley did not respond to an email requesting comment on Thursday’s letter.

1202476,UPDATE 2-Panalpina investor Cevian comes out against changes to voting rules,"* Big investors disagree over voting plan * Panalpina target of takeover battle * Cevian says foundation’s control irresponsible * Foundation says Cevian is only concerned with own interests (Adds detail, comment from company, investors, analyst) By John Revill ZURICH, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Activist investor Cevian is fighting a proposed change in voting rules at takeover target Panalpina, arguing on Tuesday that the move would cement the control of the Swiss company’s biggest shareholder and harm the interests of others. The dispute coincides with an escalating battle for control of Panalpina, the target of a $4.3 billion offer from Danish rival DSV A/S. Panalpina is also weighing a separate deal with Kuwait’s Agility Group. Panalpina’s biggest shareholder, the Ernst Goehner Foundation (EGF) with about 46 percent of stock, wants to scrap a restriction which caps voting rights at 5 percent and introduce a system of one share, one vote. Cevian, Panalpina’s second-largest stakeholder with a 12.3 percent holding, on Tuesday attacked the plan that will be put to an upcoming special shareholders meeting. The activist investor said it favours keeping the current limit of 5 percent for all shareholders, and scrapping an exemption that has allowed the foundation to vote its full stake and given it effective control over Panalpina. “The EGF proposal to abolish the voting restriction would harm the interests of all minority shareholders and stakeholders,” the Sweden-based investor said. “The last few years have shown that EGF has not exercised its controlling position in a responsible manner,” Cevian added. The Swiss company has been under pressure from Cevian to consider a takeover. U.S.-based Artisan Partners, which controls 9.99 percent of Panalpina, has also urged the Swiss company to give “impartial consideration” to DSV’s initial proposal. Should EGF’s voting rights be reduced to 5 percent, as Cevian is calling for, it could undermine the foundation’s ability to block a takeover. The foundation has rejected an earlier offer by DSV, saying Panalpina should instead concentrate on its strategy as an industry consolidator. EGF has not commented publicly on DSV’s raised offer. The foundation hit back at Cevian, accusing the activist of following its own agenda rather than supporting shareholders rights. “If Cevian now opposes the lifting of the voting rights restrictions – which means opposing shareholder-friendly, modern corporate governance – this shows Cevian is only concerned with its own interests and wants to push these through ruthlessly,” the foundation said in a statement. One analyst said the foundation was digging in its heels against the DSV offer. “It seems to be going into the direction that the main shareholders oppose the DSV offer and try to find a solution which supports the independence of Panalpina,” said Baader Helvea analyst Christian Obst. The foundation may be leaning toward cooperation with Agility, he added. A Panalpina spokeswoman said the matter was under review. “An ad hoc board of independent directors consisting of five directors, without representatives of EGF and Cevian...will review the proposal and decide how the voting on it will take place at the extraordinary general meeting,” spokeswoman Edna Ayme-Yahil said.

1203443,GRAPHIC-Franc breakout points to more tolerant SNB -banks,"* Franc hits highest since Brexit vs euro * Chart shows breakout from 18-month range: reut.rs/2jQBKit By Patrick Graham and Ruppert Pretterklieber LONDON/ZURICH, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Daily surges in the past week have taken the Swiss franc to its highest against the euro since last year’s vote by Britain to leave the European Union, encouraging German and Swiss bank speculation that the currency will be allowed to rise further. As this chart shows, another half cent jump on Monday in the exchange rate took the franc out of the ranges it has held - with the exception of a two-day blip around the Brexit vote - since the start of August 2015. Commerzbank analyst Esther Reichelt said in a note to clients that the moves were a clear sign the Swiss National Bank is ready to accept a stronger franc, two years after the dramatic removal of a cap on its value. “By doing that, it is playing a dangerous game,” she said. “The lower the SNB now allows the euro to fall, the more likely it is that market participants will speculate on it, allowing further franc gains, and the more rapidly the euro rate threatens to fall ..., sooner or later the SNB will have to react with increasing interventions again,” she added. The Swiss government last month defended the SNB’s ultra-loose monetary policy - aimed at quelling currency strength - from criticism that negative interest rates hurt banks and pension funds and makes life hard for savers. As well as running negative rates, however, the bank has intervened regularly in currency markets to keep a lid on the franc and protect Swiss exporters from the blow to competitiveness that a stronger currency brings. Banks said that the break below 1.0680 francs per euro, opened the way to a fall towards 1.05. After hitting highs on Monday, the franc dipped to 1.0657 per euro on Tuesday. “Of course the SNB will also pay close attention to the market going forward and will know how to prevent a swift fall (in the rate),” analysts from Switzerland’s Thurgauer Kantonalbank said. “But at the moment the direction is clear. The SNB, which has supported the euro exchange rate on a regular basis, is seemingly all right with a strengthening of the Swiss franc at this point in time.” (Writing by Patrick Graham; editing by Mark Heinrich)",3.5

Hyundai Oilbank, South Korea’s smallest refiner by capacity, is 91.1 percent owned by Hyundai Robotics. “Starting with Hyundai Oilbank’s initial public offering, we will continue to strengthen the transparency of our ownership structure,” a Hyundai Heavy Industries Group official said, according to a statement by the shipbuilder. Hyundai Heavy Industries, the world’s second-largest shipbuilder by order book, said the rights issue is expected to be completed by March 2018 and the sum raised will be used to improve its financial structure and for research & development. The IPO and the rights issue will prepare the group for a shipbuilding industry recovery expected to start in 2019, it said. A Hyundai Heavy spokesman said the rights issue is part of the shipbuilder’s previously announced plan to improve financial soundness. That plan began in 2015 when major South Korean shipbuilders reported losses as low oil prices drove an industry downturn, and cost overruns and delays in the construction of complex offshore facilities weighed.

1217368,Dana Gas appoints advisers for $700 mln sukuk restructuring –sources,"DUBAI, June 4 (Reuters) - United Arab Emirates energy firm Dana Gas appointed Houlihan Lokey as financial adviser and Squire Patton Boggs as legal adviser for the restructuring of its $700 million sukuk maturing in October, sources said on Sunday. The company, which has been facing a cash shortage because of missed payments from its assets in Egypt and Iraq’s Kurdistan, announced in early May its intention to hold discussions with the sukuk holders. Dana and New York-listed Houlihan Lokey did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Abu Dhabi-listed Dana’s creditors have appointed New York-based bank Moelis and U.S. legal firm Weil, Gotshal & Mangers as financial and legal advisers to negotiate the restructuring of the Islamic bonds. Dana said at the beginning of May that it needed to focus on “medium-term cash preservation” because of the challenges it faced over cash collections. As of the end of March, the company’s cash balance was $298 million. The company announced on May 18 that it had received a $50 million payment from the Egyptian government, representing 18 percent of the company’s total overdue receivables from Egypt as of the end of the first quarter of this year. A few days later it received an additional partial repayment of $20 million from Egypt. The cash price of the company’s sukuk with a 9 percent profit rate jumped by over 3 points on the news of the Egyptian payments, from 84.9 cents to 88 cents. Dana says it is also owed $714 million from the Kurdistan Regional Government. This would be the second time Dana has had to engage its creditors to amend the terms of its outstanding debt. In 2012, the firm was the first UAE entity to fail to repay a bond on time. That technical default led to a consensual restructuring.

1218029,The Adventures of Opioid-Induced Constipation Man,"Two  old friends met for coffee last week, after dropping the kids off at school. Were the other people in the café aware that the taller one was Opioid-Induced Constipation Man? Apparently not. No one snickered, or asked him to sign a bottle of Vicodin pills. This was four days after the Super Bowl—four days after Opioid-Induced Constipation Man had made his début in an advertisement, during the first half of the game, for a drug that supposedly alleviates opioid-induced constipation, or O.I.C. (Actually, the ad, paid for by the pharmaceutical giants AstraZeneca and Daiichi-Sankyo, didn’t mention the drug. It addressed the condition, not the cure. For the latter, you’ll have to have a conversation with your doctor.) Depending on your point of view, the ad was offensive, confusing, gross, or kind of hilarious. It was certainly controversial. Some felt that it won the Super Bowl. Others found it to be (not unlike the game itself) a rank illustration of the cynicism and greed underlying our overmedicated, addictive culture. President Obama’s chief of staff criticized it for encouraging drug abuse. The ad, called “Envy,” is a minute long. A middle-aged gent in a sports coat—our O.I.C.M.—is shown in various scenarios around New York, envying those not suffering from O.I.C.: a suave dude emerging triumphantly from a café bathroom, a dog pooping in a planter, a woman strutting down the street with toilet paper trailing from her shoe. Meanwhile, O.I.C.M. struggles with a clogged sugar shaker, gets stuck behind pedestrians, and looks plaintively at a jar of prunes. A little obvious, perhaps, but not so direct as, say, the old Pepto-Bismol ad (later lampooned by Johnny Carson): “Do you mind if I talk to you about diarrhea?” One minded then, as now. The man playing O.I.C.M. is a forty-seven-year-old actor named James Waterston. He has had plenty of work over the years. He was one of the students in “Dead Poets Society,” and is now in the TV shows “Red Oaks” (Amazon), “The Deuce” (HBO), and “Flesh and Bone” (Starz). Next month, he’ll perform at the Théâtre National de la Colline, in Paris, in Jean Genet’s “Splendid’s.” But this week, and for who knows how long, he shall be known as Opioid-Induced Constipation Man. In December, Waterston’s agent called to say that he’d lined up an audition for a national network ad campaign. “It’s a laxative,” the agent said. “The phrase ‘national network’ is a lot bigger than the word ‘laxative,’ ” Waterston recalled. He was in the coffee shop, paying the bathroom exiters little mind. “National network is the crown jewel of commercial work. An ad like this could be worth, like, five years of theatre gigs.” He went on, “At the audition, they were secretive. They didn’t make any reference to the product. Just ‘You’re sitting in a café and you see a really cool guy.’ I didn’t understand the material. At the callback, it was ‘You’re looking at a snail, and you smile.’ ” Still, he was excited when he got the job. The word was: hot director, black-and-white, Woody Allen style. They shot for three days. “A day into it, I got a sense of the story. The big surprise, that day, was that this was a Super Bowl ad. I thought, Oh, this is something that’s going to be  seen , not just something that is going to  run . Every job exacts its pound of flesh.” It had been a decade or so since he’d done commercial work: he was the guy who said “wow” in a Microsoft spot. There’d been a time, too, when he was playing Konstantin, in “The Seagull,” “and everyone knew me as the guy in the Heineken ad.” Waterston doesn’t usually watch the Super Bowl, but he tuned in to this one, at home, in Harlem. As soon as the ad ran, his phone blew up. “It was a funny window into fame. It suddenly dumped on me, as it were.” His father, the actor Sam Waterston (TD Ameritrade Guy), complimented his work. “He said it was clever, subtle, funny.” One friend texted, “Get off drugs  NOW ! (Take a shit and find love!!!).” (For what it’s worth, Opioid-Induced Constipation Man has encountered opioids only once, after being stabbed during an attempted mugging in New Orleans, in 1995. He doesn’t recall what they induced.) If the ad gets into regular circulation, he stands a chance of being known for it, like other actors in iconic ads: Time to Make the Donuts Man; Where’s the Beef Lady; or Mikey, Boy Who Likes It. For a time, Bryan Cranston was the face of Preparation H. But the adverto-sphere is more diffuse these days. “I’d need to do fifteen of these ads,” Waterston said. “ ‘Now he’s in the country, walking around.’ I don’t think that’s likely.” On the day after the Super Bowl, he took his nine-year-old son to school. He asked him, “What did you think?” “You’re famous, you’re famous!” the boy exclaimed. “What about the subject matter?” “Oh, it’s inappropriate.” ♦",4.0

1228699,The Mail,"What Happened? I was disappointed that David Remnick’s article about Hillary Clinton didn’t discuss the role of redistricting and voter suppression in the 2016 election (“Still Here,” September 25th). The impact of the Republican  REDMAP  redistricting plan has been well documented. Since 2010, as Republicans have gained more and more governorships and seats in state legislatures, they have deliberately made it harder for minorities, young people, and women to vote. Suppression measures include strict voter-I.D. laws, new residency requirements, ending early voting, restricting third-party voter-registration drives, and reducing the number of polling places in Democratic strongholds. The gutting of the Voting Rights Act by the Supreme Court, in 2013, unleashed another wave of efforts to suppress voting. These measures are usually justified by bogus claims of voter fraud. Donald Trump has frequently pushed this false narrative, as has Kris Kobach, who heads Trump’s Election Integrity Commission. (As the Kansas secretary of state, Kobach is a strong proponent of the Interstate Crosscheck program, which has disenfranchised thousands of voters.) New voter-I.D. laws have been shown to depress turnout by as much as seven per cent, according to a survey by the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Trump won the election by a mere eighty thousand votes in three states—Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania—where there was considerable evidence of voter suppression. Everyone should be extremely concerned about this threat to democracy. It confounds me that Hillary Clinton and leaders in the Democratic Party aren’t screaming about it from the rooftops every day. Laura Mosedale London, U.K. In Remnick’s article, Hillary Clinton avoids addressing a number of the factors that led to her shocking loss to Donald Trump: her connections to Wall Street and corporate America, her interventionist foreign policy, and her failure to fire up the Democratic base. During the primaries, Bernie Sanders not only excited this base but also expanded its numbers, all without playing into the hands of the plutocrats whose money Clinton eagerly accepted. Howard Elterman New York City Although Remnick mentions Sanders’s strong dislike for Clinton, I don’t believe that the importance of his role in her defeat has been made clear enough. I can see his shadow looming behind her, almost as menacing as Trump during the debate in St. Louis. As the grandparent of millennials, I was aware that some of them had no enthusiasm for Clinton. As much as I urged them to prevent the disaster of a Trump victory, I am afraid that most of them and many of their friends didn’t vote in the Presidential election. I can’t blame them for responding to Bernie’s revolutionary appeal, but I wrote them an angry letter after the election. Then, of course, I tore it up and encouraged them to keep working for what they believe in—as we all must do. Sayre Sheldon Cambridge, Mass. Wear and Tear In her piece on the designer Iris van Herpen, Rebecca Mead questions how a dress incorporating Japanese paper would be washed (“Transformer,” September 25th). One of the many delights of long-fibred Japanese papers is that they maintain their material integrity when immersed in water and cleaning solvents. It is a big reason why these wonderfully delicate and strong papers are often used in the conservation of textiles, works on paper and parchment, and other cultural artifacts.

1228920,"Argentina, creditors agree $250 million more in default settlement: mediator","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Argentina settled with additional creditors holding defaulted sovereign bonds for just under $250 million, Daniel Pollack, the court-appointed mediator in the long-running case, said in a statement on Wednesday. The agreement in principle was reached between the government and Red Pines and Spinnaker, funds managed by Varde Partners and Spinnaker Capital, Ltd., the statement said. “Thus, the funds will be paid 150 percent of the principal of their bonds,” Pollack said, noting the settlement was within the terms outlined by Argentina on Feb. 5. The most recent settlement moves Latin America’s No. 3 economy closer to ending a 14-year legal battle over its historic default that blocked it from global credit markets. Pollack’s announcement brings the total amount of settlements agreed in principle with U.S. creditors closer to $7 billion, well above the original $6.5 billion pot of money committed by Buenos Aires to end the dispute. Since the election of President Mauricio Macri in November, Argentina has moved swiftly to settle the debt dispute, mainly with U.S.-based hedge funds that sued in federal court for full payment on sovereign bonds defaulted upon in early 2002. U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa imposed injunctions on Argentina in a 2012 ruling barring it from paying creditors who settled previously in 2005 and 2010 for less than 30 cents on the dollar without also making a court-awarded payment to certain holdout creditors. Last month Argentina’s government overturned legal impediments to paying holdout creditors, thus meeting Griesa’s requirements for lifting the injunctions. This was nearly the final step that would allow Latin America’s No. 3 economy an unencumbered return to international capital markets. The injunctions were removed by Griesa on March 2. The issue will be heard before the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals on April 13. Pollack said that as part of the agreement announced on Wednesday, the funds express their support for and withdraw their opposition in the Court of Appeals to the lifting of the injunction. “If the Order is affirmed, this settlement will become final and binding on the parties,” Pollack said. The country has until noon New York City time on April 14 to pay $4.65 billion to the main hedge funds that fought for and won an advantageous settlement after balking at the terms offered in two prior settlements. Argentina plans to pay off the creditors in cash after issuing up to $12.5 billion in new bonds. About $3 billion more is needed to pay smaller funds that joined the suit over the years.

1237911,Explainer: What would it take for U.S. regulators to break up Facebook?,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc co-founder and Mark Zuckerberg’s former college roommate Chris Hughes urged U.S. regulators to break up the social media company in a New York Times opinion piece on Thursday. But antitrust law makes such a proposal tough to execute because the government would have to take the company to court and win. It is rare to break up a company but not unheard of, with Standard Oil and AT&T being the two biggest examples. Hughes’ call to split Facebook from WhatsApp and Instagram followed a March pledge by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination for the 2020 election, to break up big tech companies. Facebook rejected Hughes’ call for a breakup. “Accountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the internet. That is exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has called for,” Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice president of global affairs and communications, said in an emailed statement. What is Hughes’ argument? Hughes called for the Federal Trade Commission, working with the Justice Department, to force Facebook to undo its purchases of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. He said the three could become separate publicly traded companies. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives would be required to divest management shares. Hughes’ criticisms of Facebook focused on its massive power over speech, and the fact that it was a tool that Russia used to manipulate U.S. voters in 2016 with false news reports. He also expressed concern that Zuckerberg had outsized power in such a dominant firm, saying: “Mark is a good, kind person. But I’m angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks.” How could a breakup happen? To force a company to break up, the government would have to file a lawsuit demonstrating that the firm has market power in the industry and that the deal has hurt consumers by pushing up prices or reducing product quality. This could be particularly hard in the case of Facebook or other technology companies, especially those that provide a free service to users. “The case law as it stands today would make the structural breakup of any of these companies very challenging,” an antitrust expert based in Washington said. It is rare for the government to seek to break up an existing company, but it has been done. Famously, the United States sued to break up Standard Oil, accusing it of being an abusive monopoly. The case was fought all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1911 that the company should be broken up. In 1974, the U.S. government filed an antitrust lawsuit against AT&T Corp because it had a monopoly on telephone lines. After eight years of litigation, the two sides reached a settlement that led to AT&T giving up control of its regional operating companies, or Baby Bells. Perhaps the most famous case is the government’s effort to break up Microsoft. The Justice Department won a preliminary victory in 2000 but was reversed on appeal. The case settled with Microsoft intact. There are recent examples with smaller companies. The Justice Department forced consumer review website Bazaarvoice Inc to undo a 2012 merger with rival PowerReviews in 2014. The FTC this week won a victory in trying to break up a merger of two prosthetic knee makers: Otto Bock HealthCare North America, Inc and Freedom Innovations. An administrative law judge ruled in its favor on May 6. What about privacy issues? U.S. lawmakers are also considering privacy legislation that would weaken companies like Facebook by reducing the amount of personal user data they control, thus reducing their value to advertisers. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat, said in April that the was considering legislation that would focus on data portability, so users of one social media could take their information from one site to another. How powerful is Facebook? Congress held a series of hearings last year looking at the dominance of major tech companies, including their considerable political heft. Facebook has huge global reach, with 1.56 billion users daily as of March. It had 37,700 full-time employees as of the end of March spread around offices in 20 U.S. cities and dozens more around the world. Tech companies are among the biggest U.S. political donors. Google spent $21 million to lobby in 2018 while Amazon spent $14.2 million and Facebook spent $12.62 million, according to their filings to U.S. Congress.

While a firmer dollar prompted currency traders to book some profits after a more than 2.3 percent rally in the pound so far this month, various market position indicators and derivative market signals are indicating more pound bullishness for now. On Thursday, the British currency edged a fifth of a percent lower at $1.3038 after briefly scaling a 2-1/2 month high of $1.3094 in the Asian session. It was trading just below a key market level of $1.3071, the 200-day moving average for the pound, a level it hasn’t traded above since May 2018. The pound has been the biggest gainer this month in the G10 currency universe with its peers such as the dollar and the euro dogged by concerns of a spreading slowdown in the global economy. “The driver behind the latest recovery in the pound has been expectations that a no-deal withdrawal can be avoided, and yesterday’s headlines encouraged investors to add to those bets,” said Charalambos Pissouros, a senior market analyst at JFD Brokers. An attempt by British lawmakers to prevent a no-deal Brexit gained momentum on Wednesday after the opposition Labour Party said it was likely to throw its parliamentary weight behind that. Data has also been briefly supportive of the pound this week after strong employment data this week suggested Britain’s labor market remained robust despite an economic slowdown before Brexit. In the absence of weekly positions data, banks’ internal flows and data compiled by some of the biggest institutions — BNP Paribas, Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Scotiabank — indicated pound positions have become more neutral in recent days compared to big bearish bets in December. Implied volatility gauges in the pound also extended their downward path with one-month tenors falling to a two month low on Thursday at around 10.5 “vol” and nearly half of levels seen in mid-November. Against the euro, the pound was slightly weaker at 87.05 pence. (Reporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Editing by Toby Chopra)",3.0
1249704,Yahoo launches auction process as Starboard gears up for fight,"(Reuters) - Yahoo Inc officially launched the sale of its core business on Friday, a move seen as a positive step for frustrated investors but not enough to keep an activist hedge fund from pursuing a proxy fight against the struggling Internet company. Yahoo YHOO.O shares jumped after the company announced its board has formed a committee of independent directors to explore strategic alternatives, and that it has hired investment banks and a law firm to run the process. The launch of the auction process, a move activist hedge fund Starboard Value and other shareholders have pushed since late last year, showed the company was moving another step closer to selling its core business, which includes search, mail and news sites, rather than spin it off as previously planned. The move follows more than three years of effort by CEO Marissa Mayer to turn around Yahoo by focusing on mobile apps and trying to boost advertising revenue. Yahoo had acknowledged during its earnings last month that it was open to exploring options for its core business. Despite the launch, Starboard’s founder Jeffrey Smith is not backing down, and will continue his pursuit of nominating a group of directors for the Yahoo board, people familiar with the matter said. Smith stated in a letter to the board on Jan. 6 that if the board is unwilling to accept the need for significant change, “then an election contest may very well be needed so that shareholders can replace a majority of the Board with directors who will represent their best interests.” Even though the board is showing that it’s now willing to accept that need, Smith is still going to nominate a slate of directors to ensure that the sales process is handled properly, people familiar with the matter said. The window for a shareholder to nominate a director or group of directors to the Yahoo board begins on Feb. 25 and ends on March 26, with the annual meeting expected to be held in May, according to the company’s proxy statement. “It seems pretty clear that the only reason this is happening even is because of the threat of the proxy fight,” Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said. Starboard, which owns about 0.75 percent of Yahoo, declined to comment. Yahoo’s attempt to sell its core business comes after shelving previous plans to spin off its stake in ecommerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N). “Separating our Alibaba stake from Yahoo’s operating business is essential to maximizing value for our shareholders,” Mayer said on Friday. Yahoo’s board is concerned about the risk of losing a possible proxy contest, investor Eric Jackson, of SpringOwl Asset Management, said. Yahoo’s committee of independent directors has engaged Goldman Sachs & Co Inc (GS.N), J.P. Morgan (JPM.N) and PJT Partners Inc as financial advisers, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP as legal adviser. Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is among the companies seen as a potential buyer of Yahoo’s core business.

1249990,Hopes rise as two Koreas open liaison office on North's side of border,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North and South Korea opened a liaison office on the North’s side of their heavily militarized border on Friday, setting up a permanent channel of communication as part of a flurry of efforts to end their decades old rivalry. Steps by North and South Korea to improve their relations are running parallel to a bid by the United States and its allies to press North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. The opening of the joint liaison office at Kaesong, just inside the North Korean side of the border, comes days before North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in are due to hold their third meeting this year. “The two sides are now able to take a large step toward peace, prosperity and unification of the Korean peninsula by quickly and frankly discussing issues arising from inter-Korean relations,” said Ri Son Gwon, the head of North Korea’s delegation at the opening ceremony. The two Koreas previously communicated by fax and special telephone lines, which were often severed when their relations took a turn for the worse. Now they will now be able to “directly discuss issues 24 hours, 365 days”, South Korea’s Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon said at the ceremony. The office will be staffed by up to 20 people each from the two sides with the South Koreans on the second floor and the North Koreans on the fourth floor of the four-story building. Vice minister-level officials will head their teams at the office and will attend weekly meetings, the South Korean Unification Ministry said. The office is at the site of the Kaesong industrial complex, where for about a decade, South Korean companies ran production lines staffed by North Korean workers at the industrial park. The park, once the most striking symbol of inter-Korean cooperation, has been closed since February 2016 when tension on the peninsula spiked after North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test. South Korea’s Unification Ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun said this week it was hoped the liaison office could also help the United States and North Korea in their negotiations. “We hope that this will also help the progress of denuclearization talks between North Korea and the United States,” Baik said. Moon and Kim, who agreed on a series of steps to improve ties at an April summit, will meet in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang next week, when it is hoped they can help end an impasse between the United States and North Korea. South Korea had hoped to open the office by August but it was delayed when denuclearization talks between the United States and North Korea stalled after an historic summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore in June. However, Kim sent a message to South Korean envoys last week saying he wanted to achieve denuclearization during Trump’s first term. That followed what Trump described as a “very warm” letter from Kim requesting another meeting, which rekindled hopes for progress. Reporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Paul Tait, Robert Birsel",2.5

1252396,Samsung burning to regain trust with results of Note 7 fires probe,"* Samsung to reveal causes of Galaxy Note 7 fires on Monday * Announcement comes ahead of Galaxy S8 launch * Note 7 was launched in August, scrapped in October * Batteries, not software, caused fires -source By Hyunjoo Jin SEOUL, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd plans on Monday to reveal reasons behind the spontaneous combustion of its recalled Galaxy Note 7, as the world’s biggest smartphone maker works to regain consumer trust before launching its next premium model. The announcement would come more than three months after Samsung scrapped the short-lived competitor of Apple Inc’s iPhones, costing $5.3 billion in operating profit. Reports of Note 7 handsets catching fire began soon after their August launch. A recall to replace the batteries did not solve the problem, prompting a second recall. Its reputation damaged, sales of the Galaxy S8 will be widely seen as a barometer of Samsung’s ability to bounce back from the debacle. “Consumers will not be reluctant to buy the S8, expected in April or May, only if Samsung clearly finds out what caused the fires,” said Hi Investment analyst Song Myung-sup. Samsung is likely to offer several reasons for the fires, including the battery - whose capacity was 16 percent more than the preceding model - as well as heat management software, said former Samsung mobile engineer Kim Yong-serk. “Samsung may have given a really high target for its battery capacity to suppliers, as consumers demand longer battery life,” said Kim, a professor at Sungkyunkwan University. “Its waterproof feature may have prevented heat from dissipating.” Samsung on Friday said it would announce the findings of investigations conducted by itself and independent organisations, as well as a “quality enhancement plan”. Mobile chief Koh Dong-jin will chair a briefing on the fires’ causes. In September, the engineer-turned-president announced the recall of 2.5 million Note 7 handsets due to faulty batteries from a supplier, later identified as affiliate Samsung SDI Co Ltd. But handsets with cells from another supplier - China’s Amperex Technology Ltd (ATL) - continued to catch fire, casting doubt on the faulty battery explanation. That prompted a second recall and permanent end to sales. Analysts said shipping replacement phones before identifying the root cause of the fires injured Samsung’s reputation. “The biggest mistake Samsung made was that it recalled its Note 7 again,” said HMC Investment Securities analyst Greg Roh. The firm would have difficulty convincing investors the matter is resolved if it again only blamed the batteries, he added. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters last week that Samsung was able to replicate the fires and had identified the batteries as the main cause. The person said the fires could not be explained by hardware or software design. Despite the impact of the Note 7’s demise, the South Korean firm expects fourth-quarter operating profit to hit a more than three-year high, driven by booming chip sales. That forecast pushed Samsung’s share price to a record high this month. Samsung will announce its final earnings figures on Tuesday. Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Christopher Cushing",4.0

1257283,ADM to buy French animal nutrition business Neovia for $1.8 billion,"PARIS/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) (ADM.N) is in exclusive talks to take over French animal feed business Neovia for 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) as part of the U.S. farm giant’s strategy to expand in the fast-growing animal nutrition sector. Neovia is majority owned by French cooperative group InVivo. Investment group Eurazeo (EURA.PA) also has a 17 percent stake. The acquisition, first reported by Reuters, would make ADM a major player in the global animal feed industry, which the company says has sales of more than $700 billion. ADM and rival grain merchants such as Bunge Ltd (BG.N) and Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] have struggled in recent years as a global oversupply of food commodities has made it tough to turn a profit on their core business: buying, processing, and selling corn, soy and wheat. The companies have been diversifying into higher-margin sectors, such as food ingredients and aquaculture feed, to compensate for the poor returns. “We were happy with our animal feed activities but it was too local,” Pierre-Christophe Duprat, ADM’s president for Europe, Middle East and Africa, told Reuters. “If we wanted to expand we needed a more global approach.” The acquisition would be ADM’s second largest to date after it purchased natural food ingredients company Wild Flavors for $3 billion in 2014. Talks about a separate takeover of Bunge stalled this year, according to sources and media reports. ADM shares fell 1.3 percent on Monday to close at $45.23. Bunge shares slipped 0.6 percent to $69.33. Neovia, which had sales of 1.7 billion euros ($2 billion) in 2017, produces and sells a range of products related to pet care, aquaculture, livestock feed and other areas. “If you’re management and your goal is to move away from the grain merchandising operations and the volatility that comes with that, this is the way to do it at a fair price,” said Seth Goldstein, equity analyst for Morningstar in Chicago. Neovia has a limited presence in North America but a large one in Europe, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America, with 75 percent of its sales coming from outside Western Europe. This complements ADM’s animal nutrition business, which is primarily in the United States and has growing exposure in China, according to Fitch Ratings. ADM is the most U.S.-focused of the major grain companies and has been trying to expand its geographic footprint. The transaction can “serve as a platform for additional potential bolt-on acquisitions to expand the firm’s geographical reach,” Fitch Ratings said. ADM would divert its feed activities into Neovia’s to create a new unit, called ADM-Neovia, with combined sales approaching $3.5 billion, Duprat said. The takeover would lead to a reorganization and a likely reduction in staff in France, he said. ADM said the deal would offer run-rate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) synergies of about 50 million euros by the fourth full year after the transaction closes. The target seems “adequately conservative,” JP Morgan analyst Ann Duignan said. The deal would be 100 percent cash and is expected to be finalized in the fourth quarter of the year after a consultation process involving employee representatives and pending supervisory authority approval. Lazard is ADM’s financial adviser and Baker McKenzie its legal adviser. InVivo, France’s largest cooperative group, would use 1 billion euros expected from the sale to step up investment in new farming techniques and support acquisitions in wine, Chief Executive Thierry Blandinieres said in an interview. In another sign ADM is seeking to diversify its portfolio, the company said on Friday it would pay 185 million pounds ($242 million) to buy Probiotics International Limited, better known under its umbrella brand Protexin, a Britain-based maker of probiotic supplements for people and animals.

1257384,LPC: Hearty demand baked in to US$3bn loan for Panera buy,"NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - A US$3bn loan backing the US$7.2bn takeover of bakery chain Panera Bread Co by JAB Holding Co, owned by Germany’s billionaire Reimann family, is being arranged by a bank group led by JP Morgan and meeting solid demand, several bankers said. JAB, which last year bought coffee maker Keurig Green Mountain Inc and breakfast sweets specialist Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, announced the deal with Panera on April 5. “JAB owns coffee, donuts, bagels and now is expanding into lunch by buying Panera Bread,” a banker said. The pro rata financing includes a US$2.25bn term loan A and a US$750m revolving credit facility. The loans have already been syndicated successfully to the top-tier banks, another banker said. The deal included nine banks with three top leads. The debt will later be more broadly syndicated, though some banks are expected to keep their pieces. “A lot of those banks will want to hold it,” said a third banker. “There’s a big appetite for regional and foreign banks to own those assets as almost a strategy and they get ancillary capital markets business as a result.” Pricing on the debt will be tied to a leverage-based grid and opens at 200bp over Libor, the second banker said. Pro rata deals are typically sold to banks as opposed to the broader institutional market and include more stringent terms than term loan Bs. Term loan As generally have shorter maturities than term loan Bs and amortize more quickly but are less expensive and offer a way for issuers to lower the cost of capital. The Panera financing is not expected to include a term loan B portion, according to two of the bankers. The financing follows a path that JAB has previously used when purchasing companies. The firm has typically utilized a pro rata component and placed the debt on the target’s books in a similar way to leveraged buyouts, which has led to the deals being leveraged as opposed to carrying the investment grade rating that JAB holds. JAB is rated Baa1/BBB+. Panera is currently unrated. JAB opted to only tap the pro rata market in June 2016 when it last financed a deal. At that time, it lined up a US$350m term loan A and a US$150m revolving credit facility to finance its US$1.35bn purchase of Krispy Kreme, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. Both tranches priced at 275bp over Libor. JAB increased the size of the term loan A backing its acquisition of Keurig in January 2016 to US$3.075bn from US$2.95bn. That loan, along with a US$500m revolving credit facility, priced at 200bp over Libor, as well. However, in addition to the pro rata debt, JAB opted to arrange a US$1.875bn term loan B and a €842m term loan B to back the larger Keurig deal. The dollar-denominated loan priced at 450bp over Libor while the euro-denominated loan priced at 425bp over Euribor. JP Morgan declined comment. A spokesperson for JAB Holdings did not immediately return request for comment. Additional reporting by Kristen Haunss

1259008,Sixth body found under collapsed buildings in French city of Marseille,"MARSEILLE, France (Reuters) - The body of a sixth victim has been found in the rubble of two dilapidated buildings that collapsed this week in the city of Marseille, said a public prosecutor official on Wednesday. The buildings collapsed on Monday morning. Emergency services combing through the rubble have now found the bodies of four men and two women. Authorities had initially said that up to eight people might have been buried in the debris. Rescue teams said their work had been complicated since the collapse had destabilized other nearby buildings in the street, which lies not far from the city’s historic Old Port area. Authorities said they were looking into what caused the collapse of the buildings, described by residents of the area as dilapidated and in need of repair.

1263874,Australian insurer hired a private eye to surveil mentally ill woman,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian life insurer paid a private investigator who covertly filmed a mentally-ill woman eating breakfast, holding hands with her partner and undressing at a swimming pool in a bid to find evidence to avoid paying her claim, an inquiry into finance sector misconduct heard on Thursday. TAL Services Ltd, owned by Japan’s Dai-ichi Life Holdings Inc (8750.T), said it also made the woman keep a daily diary of her activities so it could find reasons to minimize its payments to her, a requirement that ultimately drove her to self-harm. The account of surveillance made for a day of explosive evidence at the inquiry which has turned its sights to the insurance sector after rocking the consumer credit, rural lending, small business banking and pension sectors with allegations of misconduct. TAL general manager Loraine van Eeden told the inquiry the company paid the investigator A$20,000 ($14,360) to surveil the woman for two and a half weeks, morning to night, including visiting her house and watching her hike, swim, hold hands with her partner, give a talk at a library and eat at her local pizza shop. Inquiry lawyer Rowena Orr quoted the investigator’s report as saying the woman “displayed a happy, confident, carefree demeanor ... showing no outward signs of her alleged psychological condition”. Orr added: “There is content about the insured having to remove her clothing to swim at the pool. The insured had no idea that the private investigator was following her around town, taking videos.” Van Eeden said the company had hired the investigator to avoid paying the woman, who had anxiety and whose name was not made public at the inquiry, about A$2,000 a month, and that “it’s not how to treat any claimant”. It was only after the woman provided a doctor’s certificate declaring that the daily diary required by the company was driving her to self-harm that TAL told the woman about the surveillance. It ended her policy and demanded that she return A$69,000 in payments for claims, the inquiry heard. The inquiry heard earlier that Australia’s corporate regulator allowed the life insurance arm of Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX) to make a A$300,000 community donation when it could have faced a fine of A$8 million for misleading advertising. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) also let CBA’s CommInsure suggest edits to a media announcement about the potentially misleading ads to remove any admission that the company had misled customers, the inquiry heard. CommInsure’s executive general manager, Helen Troup, told the inquiry the regulator had asked in a series of 2017 emails if a A$300,000 “community benefit payment” would resolve its concern that the insurer had failed to disclose the limits of its heart attack coverage in advertising pamphlets. “We would have taken the approach of continuing to defend our position, so this was alternative,” Troup said. Kenneth Hayne, the retired judge running the Royal Commission, asked if Troup considered the payment a sufficient punishment. She replied: “I think we felt that the A$300,000 community benefit payment was a form of punishment.” Troup said she did not remember how the A$300,000 figure was arrived at. When Hayne asked if the amount seemed small, Troup replied: “That’s probably for other people to judge.” ASIC had wanted its media release to say that CommInsure agreed with ASIC’s concerns that it had engaged in misleading or deceptive advertising, Troup said. But CommInsure gave alternative wording to remove any suggestion that it accepted the complaint, she said. “As we acknowledged ASIC’s concerns, we didn’t entirely agree with them,” Troup told the inquiry. “We were still defending our position ... but sitting here today ... I can see how ASIC’s concerns were legitimate,” she said. CBA sold its life insurance unit to Hong Kong-based AIA Group (1299.HK) for $3.1 billion last year, but the sale is still to be completed.

1264955,U.S. judge eyes Friday ruling on Illinois Medicaid bill payments,"CHICAGO, June 28 (Reuters) - A ruling on how much more money Illinois needs to allocate to Medicaid provider bills to ensure continued medical care for the state’s poor and disabled residents should come out on Friday, a U.S. District Court judge said on Wednesday. Judge Joan Lefkow questioned a proposal made by attorneys representing Illinois’ 3 million Medicaid recipients that would force the cash-strapped state to send $2 billion to managed-care organizations over four months to pay down a $3.1 billion bill backlog. The attorneys also asked for an additional $586 million in monthly payments to providers starting July 1, noting that federal Medicaid reimbursements would cut Illinois’ total outlay about in half. The judge called the proposed funding scheme a “significant jump.” In her June 7 order, which found Illinois was not complying with federal consent decrees regarding Medicaid, Lefkow said plaintiffs were merely seeking sufficient payments to sustain services. But negotiations ordered by the judge failed to reach a deal. Brent Stratton, an assistant Illinois Attorney General, told the judge the plaintiffs were attempting to get “blood from a stone,” given the state’s lack of a budget for two years and its $15 billion pile of unpaid bills. Lefkow instructed the state to submit its proposal for a $75 million increase in monthly Medicaid payments that would be matched by $75 million in federal funds, along with a plan to reduce outstanding unpaid bills. She also asked the other side to present evidence that Medicaid recipients were being denied care due to the state’s nonpayment of bills. Illinois’ payments out of its operating fund for the Medicaid and other federal consent decrees total about $160 million a month. David Chizewer, an attorney for Medicaid recipients, said by accepting federal Medicaid dollars Illinois must comply with the consent decrees that stem from lawsuits filed in 1992 and with federal law. “We are not asking them to print up money that doesn’t exist, but for a shift in priorities,” he said. In a court filing on Tuesday, Assistant Illinois Comptroller Kevin Schoeben said increasing the amount of priority payments made out of the state’s general fund for Medicaid beyond the proposed additional $75 million would result in insufficient revenue to make full monthly payments to other priorities such as pensions and payroll. Meanwhile, Illinois lawmakers face a Friday deadline to pass a budget ahead of the Saturday start of fiscal 2018. (Reporting by Karen Pierog; Editing by Matthew Lewis)",4.5
1267869,"Wall Street off as pound crashes, jobs data keeps Fed on track","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped on Friday as a drop in the British pound injected unwanted volatility to financial markets, while a weaker-than-expected jobs report was not enough to derail expectations for a rate hike from the Federal Reserve before the end of the year. Major indexes posted their first negative week in four. The pound GBP= lost 1.4 percent to the dollar on Friday, and at one point earlier it had tumbled as much as 10 percent over just a few minutes, a ""flash crash"" that fueled concerns about the vulnerability of the currency and triggered volatility across jittery markets. Despite the sharp drop in sterling, the dollar index .DXY ended the day lower. “I don’t think the pound itself is going to hurt U.S. earnings, but the volatility and the big drop you’ve seen in the last week are disturbing,” said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer, Multi-Asset Strategies and Solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York. The pound lost more than 4 percent versus the U.S. dollar this week and hit its lowest level in more than 30 years. Stocks were also weighed by a report showing the U.S. economy created 156,000 jobs last month, shy of the estimate for 175,000, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 5 percent. It was the third straight month of slowing growth in job creation, but the data was not seen as weak enough to prevent the Fed from raising rates later this year. “The Fed tightening into economic strength is fine, but it is a headwind when valuations are high,” Zemsky said. At 17 times, the S&P 500’s price-to-earnings ratio is near the highest it has been over the past decade. A near 9 percent decline in shares of Honeywell (HON.N) was the biggest drag on the S&P, a day after the aero parts supplier lowered the upper end of its 2016 sales and profit forecast. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 28.01 points, or 0.15 percent, to 18,240.49, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 7.03 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,153.74 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 14.45 points, or 0.27 percent, to 5,292.41. The three indexes closed down for the week after three consecutive weeks of gains. Adding to trader jitters, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump will face off on Sunday in the second of three debates ahead of the November presidential election. Voya’s Zemsky said markets have priced a Clinton win and some traders may have hedged positions ahead of the weekend. Among other heavy losers on Friday, chemical company PPG (PPG.N) dropped 8.3 percent to $93.73 after forecasting a third-quarter loss and Tyson Foods (TSN.N) plunged 8.9 percent to $67.75 after Pivotal Capital downgraded its stock to “sell” from “buy”. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.89-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 4 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 39 new lows.

1271467,Spanish PM makes wage increase bet with eye on election,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Friday decreed a 22 percent rise in the minimum wage, the biggest in four decades, and a move that could strengthen his grip on power but defies warnings that it could worsen unemployment. Such decrees are one of the rare ways Sanchez, whose Socialist party controls only a quarter of seats in parliament, can try to make an impact on the economy and get voters on his side ahead of a spate of elections next year. “This is the biggest rise in the minimum wage since 1977 and it will benefit more than 2.5 million people, mostly women,” government spokeswoman Isabel Celaa told a news conference after the weekly cabinet meeting, which was held in Barcelona. The increase to 1,050 euros ($1,197.84) per month will allow Spain to jump from having one of Europe’s lowest minimum wage, as compared to average wage, to one of the highest. Wages had been slashed in Spain, the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy, as a way out of a steep economic crisis that started in 2008, leaving many struggling to make ends meet. “Sanchez has realized that he can mobilize left-wing voters with issues that have huge symbolic weight such as the minimum wage,” said Lluis Oriols, a political science professor at Madrid’s Carlos III university. Spanish voters go to the polls at the end of May for a series of municipal, regional and European elections. Speculation has been rife over whether and when Sanchez could call snap elections ahead of the 2020 scheduled date. The Bank of Spain, International Monetary Fund and employer groups warned against the minimum wage increase, which will enter into force on Jan. 1, saying it would make it harder for those struggling to find a job, in particular young people. The OECD think-tank was more positive, saying the move would better align Spain with its neighbors. The AIREF fiscal watchdog, an independent body, estimates that 40,000 jobs would be lost in 2019 because of the minimum wage increase. But the boost for those who do have a job will bring an extra 1 billion euros into the economy, it said. Sanchez has also announced an increase of at least 2.25 percent for civil servant wages next year and a 1.6 percent increase for state pensions, which were also adopted by decree as a way to overcome his lack of a majority in parliament. There is no knowing when or if Sanchez will be able to convince a divided parliament to approve his 2019 budget for Spain, now in limbo for lack of sufficient votes. The government has not yet even sent a draft budget to parliament, but Sanchez said he would do so in January. If he cannot get it adopted he might struggle to stay in power, but if there were to be snap elections, he would be able to go to voters with measures such as the minimum wage increase. Sanchez came to power in June after several parties teamed up to oust the conservatives over a corruption scandal. But he is struggling to get these same parties to back his policies now that he is power, except on issues such as the minimum wage. Decrees need to be later endorsed by parliament, but opposition parties have said they would not oppose such a popular step. Symbolically, the step will be adopted by the cabinet in Barcelona, the Catalan regional capital, on Friday, with Sanchez stressing this is to show that his policies aim to help people throughout Spain. Catalonia’s independence drive is one of the thorniest issues for any Spanish prime minister to handle. But out on the streets of Madrid, voters were not convinced such steps would be enough to keep the Socialists in power. “It’s a positive step,” said 54-year-old accountant Isabel Martin. “But to vote for a party you need more reasons.” Additional reporting by Alba Calejero; Writing by Ingrid Melander; Editing by Mark Heinrich",4.5

1276832,Water reaches pumping station in Syrian city of Aleppo - state TV,"BEIRUT, March 14 (Reuters) - Water has reached a pumping station inside Aleppo and will “soon” go out to residential districts in the city, Syrian state media said on Tuesday. Aleppo’s main water supply has been cut off for nearly two months, and residents have largely relied on ground wells or water bought from private vendors. The Syrian army last week captured the al-Khafsa area east of Aleppo, where treatment and pumping plants provide the city with water. The army and allied forces have made rapid gains against Islamic State in the Aleppo countryside, in a sweeping advance that has brought them to the bank of the Euphrates river.

Water sources have been repeatedly damaged during Syria’s nearly six-year-old war. A U.N.

1279355,India government may direct state banks on debt resolution: finance ministry source,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The India government could issue directions to state-run banks to resolve corporate default cases and ensure there is no tampering with the pace of cleaning up bad debt, a finance ministry source said on Wednesday. The statement from the official comes a day after the Supreme Court quashed a central bank order on resolving bad debt cases. India’s top court had quashed a Reserve Bank of India (RBI)circular on resolving bad debt on Tuesday, throwing the country’s still-nascent bankruptcy regime into question. “The order does not question the power of government to give directions to banks,” said the government official, who requested anonymity. Under the law, the government can still provide directions to banks to resolve corporate default cases, even as the court withdrew the RBI’s power to push more large loan defaulters toward bankruptcy courts, the official told reporters. The Supreme Court order will provide the banking system with more flexibility and time in resolving the stressed assets, research firm CRISIL said, adding that expectations for a quick resolution could come under a cloud. The RBI circular had directed banks unable to agree upon a resolution plan with any defaulter within 180 days to drag the defaulter into a time-bound insolvency process. “We will not let insolvency and bankruptcy processes be weakened,” the official added. CRISIL, however, said the Supreme Court’s decision will not have a significant impact on new bad debt accretion levels as most of them have been recognized by the banking sector. Indian banks and financial institutions currently hold a total bad debt of over 10 trillion rupees ($146 billion). This has affected their ability to lend more and spur economic growth. The Supreme Court verdict also gives more time to bankers to resolve stressed loans in thermal power plants, outside the bankruptcy court, the official said. In 2017, a report by a Indian Parliamentary Committee had identified 34 strained power projects. The overall capacity of these projects stood at about 40,000 megawatts with a total outstanding debt of nearly 1.75 trillion rupees.

1286879,Turkey arrests 55 more pilots in post-coup investigations: NTV,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish prosecutors ordered the detention of 55 more air force pilots on Wednesday, broadcaster NTV and other media reported, as part of an ongoing crackdown following a failed coup in July. Authorities previously detained more than 300 pilots, most of them at an air base in Konya, as part of the unprecedented crackdown in which more than 110,000 people - from soldiers and judges to teachers and journalists - have been detained or suspended, and 37,000 formally arrested. The latest operation targeting supporters of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara blames for orchestrating the putsch, was carried out in eight provinces but centered in Konya, NTV said. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, has denied the charges and condemned the coup. The extent of the purges has worried rights groups and some of Turkey’s Western allies, who fear that President Tayyip Erdogan is using the failed coup as a pretext to curtain dissent. The government says the actions are justified by the gravity of the threat to the state from July 15, when rogue soldiers commandeered tanks and fighters jets, killing more than 240 people. The government has said it was working on projects to cover the shortage in air force pilots since the attempted coup, and will seek to draw back pilots from civil aviation.

The national newspaper said in an editorial that it had never taken sides in U.S. presidential elections in its 34-year history, but was abandoning the practice because the New York real estate developer was unfit for the presidency. It went on to list and expand on eight reasons for its stance, including: “He is ill-equipped to be commander in chief,” “He traffics in prejudice,” and “He’s a serial liar.” “Trump’s foreign policy pronouncements typically range from uninformed to incoherent,” the editorial said.

BYD, backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), had planned to open the site this year in Ontario with about 40 workers, a boost to green manufacturing in the country’s most populous province. “It’s just not happening right now, and we’re not necessarily waiting on anything to make it happen,” Ted Dowling, Vice President of BYD Canada said on Thursday. “When the business case makes sense, we’ll do it.” Dowling did not give a specific reason for the decision to suspend the plan, but noted that the company had made more progress winning Canadian orders for buses than trucks. He said BYD’s decision was not related to Ontario’s move on July 3 to scrap the province’s incentives for green vehicles and its cap and trade program, which required companies to buy allowances for some greenhouse gas emissions. Dowling expects Ontario’s newly elected government will roll out a new program that could be better than the old scheme. When the plan was first reported, BYD’s trucks had not been approved to operate on Canadian roads. BYD announced that approval on June 26, shortly before right-wing populist Doug Ford took office as Ontario’s premier. The provincial government said in an email it had canceled cap and trade to bring down gas prices and lower costs for families and businesses, and as a result the incentive program ended. Transport ministry spokesman Bob Nichols said Ontario would release a new environment plan later this month. A new truck plant would have been a small boost to Canada’s auto industry, which has lost jobs to the United States, where governments offer manufacturers rich incentives, and Mexico, where labor costs are lower. BYD’s assembly plant in Lancaster, California started with about 100 workers in 2013, and now employs close to 1,000, Dowling said. The Canadian auto sector was shaken this year when U.S. President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on Canadian vehicles. About 85 percent of cars made in Canada in 2016 were exported. The draft U.S.-Canada-Mexico Agreement leaves significant room for Canadian plants to grow exports duty-free. In July, BYD landed an order from the Toronto Transit Commission, the country’s largest transit operator, for ten buses with an option for 30 more. Canadian grocery store operator Loblaw Co Ltd (L.TO) tested BYD’s vehicles last year. Loblaw is hoping to place an order next year, it said in a statement. Buffett bought 10 percent of BYD in 2008 for $230 million, and the company’s market capitalization has since topped $20 billion, thanks to China’s booming electric car market.

1299378,"Correa ally leads Ecuador election polls, but second round likely","QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuador’s ruling leftist party candidate leads voting intentions in the small Andean country ahead of presidential elections next month, but does not have enough support to win in the first round, two recent polls showed. After recent major losses for Latin America’s leftist bloc, Ecuador’s election is being scrutinized for a potential further setback as the end of a regional commodities boom and corruption scandals fuel voters’ desire for change. Lenin Moreno, 63, a disabled career politician who uses a wheelchair, has garnered support with vows to continue popular president Rafael Correa’s social programs, but the ballot seems increasingly likely to spill over to a second round in April. Some 34.3 percent of voters plan to vote for Moreno, a former vice president and United Nations special envoy on disability, pollster Cedatos said on Monday night. Around 22.9 percent support Guillermo Lasso, a conservative banker and former economy minister, while 11.4 percent back Cynthia Viteri, a center-right lawyer and lawmaker, the poll showed. To win in the first round on Feb. 19, a candidate needs to secure a majority of all valid votes or win over 40 percent of them and pocket a 10 point difference with the closest rival. Worryingly for the ruling Country Alliance party, voting intentions for Moreno have slid from 37 percent in October while support for his rivals has grown, Cedatos said. “The probability of a second round is stronger by the day,” Cedatos head Polibio Cordova told local TV station Ecuavisa. The Cedatos poll, of 2,120 people between Jan. 16-23, did not survey voting intentions for a potential second round on April 2. Separately, pollster Market on Sunday also placed Moreno ahead of the pack with 28.17 percent of voting intentions, according to a survey of 9,120 people conducted between Jan. 18-20. Viteri and Lasso were close at 17.98 percent and 16.57 percent respectively. As a corruption scandal involving Ecuador’s national oil company and Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht grows, analysts see a significant chance of Moreno losing down the line. “While a Lasso second-round victory remains our base case, Viteri would also likely beat Moreno in a run-off, as the opposition will mostly rally around a single candidate and voter discontent will remain high,” Eurasia consultancy said in a report last week. Some 12.8 million Ecuadoreans will vote to elect a president and 137 lawmakers for a four-year period.

1330558,What's Inside Flamin' Hot Cheetos? Probably Something Spicy,"Creating a tongue-scorching taste sensation like Flamin’ Hot Cheetos is an art. Every ingredient plays a specific role in sculpting the experience. It’s kind of like a neon Monet (except you can eat it). Up close, the dots and dabs are meticulously placed. When you step back, those brushstrokes merge and you get the beautiful impression of a lily pad. Or in this case, a spicy, cheese-flavored explosion. The food artistes over at Frito-Lay apply just the right textures, tastes, colors, and aromas to keep you coming back for more. And more. Put down the bag and step away. Enriched CornmealWheat can taste bitter, and rice runs a bit sweet, but corn is pretty bland—the perfect foundation for cheese-flavored snacks like Cheetos. To make cornmeal, industrial producers put corn into a mill, which breaks the kernel, and remove the reproductive part of the seed, the germ, to prevent spoiling. The germ can be whisked away to make corn oil, and the remaining corn is ground into meal. But stripping each kernel means you strip a lot of its nutritional value, so nutrients—ferrous sulfate, niacin, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid—are added to “enrich” the meal.To make a crunchy puff, food producers like Frito-Lay pour a cornmeal mush into an extruder, a machine that can reach more than 350 degrees Fahrenheit. A metal screw twists the cornmeal into dough and pushes it toward a tiny opening. The dough cooks in the extruder, and as it’s forced through the exit, moisture escapes in a flash of steam and the stuff expands into a puff. ",3.5

Space junk is the colloquial name for orbital bits that do nothing useful: spent rockets, fragments splayed by collisions and degradation, old satellites no one cares about anymore. In total, they amount to millions of pieces of debris, many of which are large enough to seriously ding satellites and the International Space Station. And then there's Kessler Syndrome: a space sickness in which low-Earth orbit is so overpopulated that collisions cascade into more collisions, which create more debris that causes more collisions that cascade into more collisions. It's all very bad for Sandra Bullock. And it's about to get worse: Thousands and thousands of satellites are set to launch to low-Earth orbit before 2025. ",4.5

1343540,French competition watchdog launches online ad inquiry,"PARIS, May 23 (Reuters) - The French competition authority launched an inquiry on Monday on the exploitation of Internet users’ data for the online advertising industry, putting major personal data collectors such as Alphabet Inc’s Google in its sights. The inquiry, which includes a public consultation starting early next year, will result in non-binding recommendations but may become the basis of a formal anti-trust investigation if infringements are observed. “Can everyone access these data, which are fundamental inputs of this business activity? Are there exclusion strategies being put in place?” Bruno Lasserre, president of the France’s anti-trust regulator, told a press conference. Google, the world’s most popular Web search engine, collects data globally from Internet users and companies via the free professional and personal services it offers online and on smart mobile devices. Its mobile operating system, Android, can be found on about 80 percent of smart mobile devices, EU data shows. This means Google has a “privileged position” in terms of data collection, said Mathieu Guennec, the French competition authority’s lead investigator. Guennec also cited Google’s presence on both the buy-side and sell-side of the online advertising business through different platforms, raising questions about the market power the U.S. company could draw from this integrated approach. No-one at Google in France was immediately available for comment. Other big data collectors cited in the French regulator’s written presentations included Facebook and Twitter . The French competition authority’s announcement comes a month after the European Union charged Google with using Android to squeeze out rivals. Google also faces its first EU anti-trust sanction this year over allegations that its Web search results favour its own shopping service, people familiar with the matter said in April. . Separately, Germany’s cartel office said in March that it was investigating Facebook for suspected abuse of market power over breaches of data protection laws.

1359714,"How the Brain Links Gestures, Perception, and Meaning","Remember the last time someone flipped you the bird? Whether or not that single finger was accompanied by spoken obscenities, you knew exactly what it meant. The conversion from movement into meaning is both seamless and direct, because we are endowed with the capacity to speak without talking and comprehend without hearing. We can direct attention by pointing, enhance narrative by miming, emphasize with rhythmic strokes and convey entire responses with a simple combination of fingers. Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences. The tendency to supplement communication with motion is universal, though the nuances of delivery vary slightly. In Papua New Guinea, for instance, people point with their noses and heads, while in Laos they sometimes use their lips. In Ghana, left-handed pointing can be taboo, while in Greece or Turkey forming a ring with your index finger and thumb to indicate everything is A-OK could get you in trouble. Despite their variety, gestures can be loosely defined as movements used to reiterate or emphasize a message—whether that message is explicitly spoken or not. A gesture is a movement that “represents action,” but it can also convey abstract or metaphorical information. It is a tool we carry from a very young age, if not from birth; even children who are congenitally blind naturally gesture to some degree during speech. Everybody does it. And yet, few of us have stopped to give much thought to gesturing as a phenomenon—the neurobiology of it, its development, and its role in helping us understand others’ actions. As researchers delve further into our neural wiring, it’s becoming increasingly clear that gestures guide our perceptions just as perceptions guide our actions. Susan Goldin-Meadow is considered a titan in the gesture field—although, as she says, when she first became interested in gestures during the 1970s, “there wasn’t a field at all.” A handful of others had worked on gestures but almost entirely as an offshoot of nonverbal-behavior research. She has since built her career studying the role of gesture in learning and language creation, including the gesture system that deaf children create when they are not exposed to sign language. (Sign language is distinct from gesturing because it constitutes a fully developed linguistic system.) At the University of Chicago, where she is a professor, she runs one of the most prominent labs investigating gesture production and perception. “It’s a wonderful window into unspoken thoughts, and unspoken thoughts are often some of the most interesting,” she said, with plenty of gestures of her own. Many researchers who trained with Goldin-Meadow are now pursuing similar questions outside the University of Chicago. Miriam Novack completed her doctorate under Goldin-Meadow in 2016, and as a postdoc at Northwestern University she examines how gesture develops over the course of a lifetime. No other species points, Novack explained, not even chimpanzees or apes, according to most reports, unless they are raised by people. Human babies, in contrast, often point before they can speak, and our ability to generate and understand symbolic motions continues to evolve in tandem with language. Gesture is also a valuable tool in the classroom, where it can help young children generalize verbs to new contexts or solve math equations. “But,” she said, “it’s not necessarily clear when kids begin to understand that our hand movements are communicative—that they’re part of the message.” When children can’t find the words to express themselves, they let their hands do the talking. Novack, who has studied infants as young as 18 months, has seen how the capacity to derive meaning from movement increases with age. Adults do it so naturally, it’s easy to forget that mapping meaning onto hand shape and trajectory is no small feat. Gestures may be simple actions, but they don’t function in isolation. Research shows that gesture not only augments language, but also aids in its acquisition. In fact, the two may share some of the same neural systems. Acquiring gesture experience over the course of a lifetime may also help us intuit meaning from others’ motions. But whether individual cells or entire neural networks mediate our ability to decipher others’ actions is still up for debate. Noam Chomsky, a towering figure in linguistics and cognitive science, has long maintained that language and sensorimotor systems are distinct entities—modules that need not work together in gestural communication, even if they are both means of conveying and interpreting symbolic thought. Because researchers don’t yet fully understand how language is organized within the brain or which neural circuits derive meaning from gesture, the question is unsettled. But many scientists, like Anthony Dick, an associate professor at Florida International University, theorize that the two functions rely on some of the same brain structures. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of brain activity, Dick and colleagues have demonstrated that the interpretation of “co-speech” gestures consistently recruits language processing centers. The specific areas involved and the degree of activation vary with age, which suggests that the young brain is still honing its gesture-speech integration skills and refining connections between regions. In Dick’s words, “Gesture essentially is one spire in a broader language system,” one that integrates both semantic processing regions and sensorimotor areas. But to what extent is the perception of language itself a sensorimotor experience, a way of learning about the world that depends on both sensory impressions and movements? Manuela Macedonia had only recently finished her master’s degree in linguistics when she noticed a recurring pattern among the students to whom she was teaching Italian at Johannes Kepler University Linz (JKU): No matter how many times they repeated the same words, they still couldn’t stammer out a coherent sentence. Printing phrases ad nauseam didn’t do much to help, either. “They became very good listeners,” she said, “but they were not able to speak.” She was teaching by the book: She had students listen, write, practice and repeat, just as Chomsky would advocate, yet it wasn’t enough. Something was missing. Today, as a senior scientist at the Institute of Information Engineering at JKU and a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Macedonia is getting closer to a hypothesis that sounds a lot like Dick’s: that language is anything but modular. When children are learning their first language, Macedonia argues, they absorb information with their entire bodies. A word like “onion,” for example, is tightly linked to all five senses: Onions have a bulbous shape, papery skin that rustles, a bitter tang and a tear-inducing odor when sliced. Even abstract concepts like “delight” have multisensory components, such as smiles, laughter and jumping for joy.  To some extent, cognition is “embodied”—the brain’s activity can be modified by the body’s actions and experiences, and vice versa. It’s no wonder, then, that foreign words don’t stick if students are only listening, writing, practicing and repeating, because those verbal experiences are stripped of their sensory associations. Macedonia has found that learners who reinforce new words by performing semantically related gestures engage their motor regions and improve recall. Don’t simply repeat the word “bridge”: Make an arch with your hands as you recite it. Pick up that suitcase, strum that guitar! Doing so wires the brain for retention, because words are labels for clusters of experiences acquired over a lifetime. Multisensory learning allows words like “onion” to live in more than one place in the brain—they become distributed across entire networks. If one node decays due to neglect, another active node can restore it because they’re all connected. “Every node knows what the other nodes know,” Macedonia said. The power of gestures to enrich speech may represent only one way in which gesture is integrated with sensory experiences. A growing body of work suggests that, just as language and gesture are intimately entwined, so too are motor production and perception. Specifically, the neural systems underlying gesture observation and understanding are influenced by our past experiences of generating those same movements, according to Elizabeth Wakefield. Wakefield, another Goldin-Meadow protégé, directs her own lab as an assistant professor at Loyola University Chicago, where she studies the way everyday actions aid learning and influence cognition. But before she could examine these questions in depth, she needed to understand how gesture processing develops. As a graduate student working with the neuroscientist Karin James at Indiana University in 2013, she performed an fMRI study that was one of the first to examine gesture perception in both children and adults.When the participants watched videos of an actress who gestured as she spoke, their visual and language processing regions weren’t the only areas firing. Brain areas associated with motor experiences were active as well, even though the participants lay still in the scanner. Adults showed more activity in these regions than children did, however, and Wakefield thinks that is because the adults had more experience with making similar motions (children tend to gesture less when they talk). “We, to my knowledge, were the first people looking at gesture processing across development,” Wakefield said. “That small body of literature on how gesture is processed developmentally has important implications for how we might think about gesture shaping learning.” Wakefield’s study is not the only evidence that gesture perception and purposeful action both stand on the same neural foundation. Countless experiments have demonstrated a similar motor “mirroring” phenomenon for actions associated with ballet, basketball, playing the guitar, tying knots and even reading music. In each case, when skilled individuals observed their craft being performed by others, their sensorimotor areas were more active than the corresponding areas in participants with less expertise. (Paradoxically, some experiments observed exactly the opposite effect: Experts’ brains reacted less than those of non-experts when they watched someone with their skills. But researchers theorized that in those cases, experience had made their brains more efficient at processing the motions.) Lorna Quandt, an assistant professor at Gallaudet University who studies these phenomena among the deaf and hard of hearing, takes a fine-grained approach. She breaks gestures down into their sensorimotor components, using electroencephalography (EEG) to show that memories of making certain actions change how we predict and perceive others’ gestures. In one study, she and her colleagues recorded the EEG patterns of adult participants while they handled objects of varying colors and weights, and then while they watched a man in a video interact with the same items. Even when the man simply mimed actions around the objects or pointed to them without making contact, the participants’ brains reacted as though they were manipulating the articles themselves. Moreover, their neural activity reflected their own experience: The EEG patterns showed that their recollections of whether the objects were heavy or light predictably influenced their perception of what the man was doing. “When I see you performing a gesture, I’m not just processing what I’m seeing you doing; I’m processing what I think you’re going to do next,” Quandt said. “And that’s a really powerful lens through which to view action perception.” My brain anticipates your sensorimotor experiences, if only by milliseconds. Exactly how much motor experience is required? According to Quandt’s experiments, for the straightforward task of becoming more expert at color-weight associations, just one tactile trial is enough, although reading written information is not. According to Dick, the notion that brain motor areas are active even when humans are immobile but observing others’ movements (a phenomenon known as “observation-execution matching”) is generally well-established. What remains controversial is the degree to which these same regions extract meaning from others’ actions. Still more contentious is what mechanism would serve as the basis for heightened understanding through sensorimotor activation. Is it coordinated activity across multiple brain regions, or could it all boil down to the activity of individual cells? More than a century ago, the psychologist Walter Pillsbury wrote: “There is nothing in the mind that has not been explained in terms of movement.” This concept has its modern incarnation in the mirror neuron theory, which posits that the ability to glean meaning from gesture and speech can be explained by the activation of single cells in key brain regions. It’s becoming increasingly clear, however, that the available evidence regarding the role of mirror neurons in everyday behaviors may have been oversold and overinterpreted. The mirror neuron theory got its start in the 1990s, when a group of researchers studying monkeys found that specific neurons in the inferior premotor cortex responded when the animals made certain goal-directed movements like grasping. The scientists were surprised to note that the same cells also fired when the monkeys passively observed an experimenter making similar motions. It seemed like a clear case of observation-execution matching but at the single-cell level. The researchers came up with a few possible explanations: Perhaps these “mirror neurons” were simply communicating information about the action to help the monkey select an appropriate motor response. For instance, if I thrust my hand toward you to initiate a handshake, your natural reaction is probably to mirror me and do the same. Alternatively, these single cells could form the basis for “action understanding,” the way we interpret meaning in someone else’s movements. That possibility might allow monkeys to match their own actions to what they observed with relatively little mental computation. This idea ultimately usurped the other because it was such a beautifully simple way to explain how we intuit meaning from others’ movements. As the years passed, evidence poured in for a similar mechanism in humans, and mirror neurons became implicated in a long list of phenomena, including empathy, imitation, altruism and autism spectrum disorder, among others. And after reports of mirroring activity in related brain regions during gesture observation and speech perception, mirror neurons became associated with language and gesture, too. Gregory Hickok, a professor of cognitive and language sciences at the University of California, Irvine, and a staunch mirror neuron critic, maintains that, decades ago, the founders of mirror neuron theory threw their weight behind the wrong explanation. In his view, mirror neurons deserve to be thoroughly investigated, but the pinpoint focus on their roles in speech and action understanding has hindered research progress. Observation-execution matching is more likely to be involved in motor planning than in understanding, he argues. Even those who continue to champion the theory of action understanding have begun to pump the brakes, according to Valeria Gazzola, who leads the Social Brain Laboratory at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience and is an associate professor at the University of Amsterdam. Although she is an advocate of the mirror neuron theory, Gazzola acknowledged that there’s no consensus about what it actually means to “understand” an action. “There is still some variability and misunderstanding,” she said. While mirror neurons serve as an important component of cognition, “whether they explain the whole story, I would say that’s probably not true.” Initially, most evidence for mirroring in humans was derived from studies that probed the activity of millions of neurons simultaneously, using techniques such as fMRI, EEG, magnetoencephalography and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Researchers have since begun to experiment with techniques like fMRI adaptation, which they can use to analyze subpopulations of cells in specific cortical regions. But they only rarely have the opportunity to take direct measurements from individual cells in the human brain, which would provide the most direct proof of mirror neuron activity. “I have no doubt that mirror neurons exist,” Hickok said, “but all of those brain imaging and brain activation studies are correlational. They do not tell you anything about causation.” Moreover, people who cannot move or speak because of motor disabilities like severe forms of cerebral palsy can in most cases still perceive speech and gestures. They don’t need fully functioning motor systems (and mirror neurons) to perform tasks that require action understanding as it’s loosely defined. Even in monkeys, Hickok said, there is no evidence that damage to mirror neurons produces deficits in action observation.Because claims about individual cells remain so difficult to corroborate empirically, most investigators today choose their words carefully. Monkeys may have “mirror neurons,” but humans have “mirroring systems,” “neural mirroring” or an “action-observation network.” (According to Hickok, even the monkey research has shifted more toward a focus on mirroring effects in networks and systems.) Quandt, who considers herself a mirror neuron centrist, makes no claims about how different experiences change the function of individual cells based on her EEG experiments. That said, she is “completely convinced” that parts of the human sensorimotor system are involved in parsing and processing other people’s gestures. “I am 100 percent sure that’s true,” she said. “It would take a lot to convince me otherwise.” Researchers may not be able to pinpoint the exact cells that help us to communicate and learn with our bodies, but the overlap between multisensory systems is undeniable. Gesture allows us to express ourselves, and it also shapes the way we understand and interpret others. To quote one of Quandt’s papers: “The actions of others are perceived through the lens of the self.” So, the next time someone gives you the one-finger salute, take a moment to appreciate what it takes to receive that message loud and clear. If nothing else, it might lessen the sting a bit.

Amazon is already one of the largest employers in the country, with almost 300,000 workers (and many more contractors), and it’s particularly hungry for more new talent. The company has more than 20,000 vacant US roles, over half of which are at its headquarters in Seattle. Meanwhile, the US economy is booming, and there are now more open jobs than there are unemployed people who can fill them, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “The purpose isn’t really to create a job ladder from fulfillment center to CEO but rather to meet employees where they are and to create opportunities for them to build on the skills that they have,” Ardine Williams, Amazon’s vice president of workforce development, said in an interview Thursday morning.

1373647,Huawei first-quarter revenue grows 39 percent to $27 billion amid heightened U.S. pressure,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies said on Monday its first-quarter revenue jumped 39 percent to 179.7 billion yuan ($26.81 billion), in the Chinese technology firm’s first-ever quarterly results. The Shenzhen-based firm, the world’s biggest telecoms equipment maker, also said its net profit margin was around 8 percent for the quarter, which it added was slightly higher than the same period last year. Huawei did not disclose its actual net profit. The limited results announcement comes at a time when Washington has intensified a campaign against unlisted Huawei, alleging its equipment could be used for espionage and urging U.S. allies to ban it from building next-generation 5G mobile networks. Huawei has repeatedly denied the allegations and launched an unprecedented media blitz by opening up its campus to journalists and making its typically low-key founder, Ren Zhengfei, available for media interviews. The Chinese firm, which is also the world’s No. 3 smartphone maker, said last week the number of contracts it has won to provide 5G telecoms gear increased further despite the U.S. campaign. By the end of March, Huawei said it had signed 40 commercial 5G contracts with carriers, shipped more than 70,000 5G base stations to markets around the world and expects to have shipped 100,000 by May. Huawei’s network business saw its first drop in revenue in two years in 2018. But Ren Zhengfei said in an interview with CNBC earlier this month that network equipment sales rose 15 percent while sales of the consumer business increased by more than 70 percent in the first quarter. “These figures show that we are still growing, not declining,” Ren said. Guo Ping, rotating chairman of the company, has said he expects all three business groups - consumer, carrier and enterprise - to post double-digit growth this year. Huawei also said on Monday it had shipped 59 million smartphones in the first quarter. It did not disclose year-ago comparable figures, but according to market research firm Strategy Analytics, Huawei shipped 39.3 million smartphones in the first quarter of 2018.

1378123,"UPDATE 2-Kenya's economy grew 5.8 percent in 2016, missing forecasts","(Updates with comments on 2017 outlook, current account deficit) By Duncan Miriri NAIROBI, April 19 (Reuters) - Kenya’s economy grew 5.8 percent last year, just above 5.7 percent growth the previous year but still slightly short of forecasts, the statistics office said on Wednesday. Government officials in the East African nation, which holds a general election in August, initially estimated the economy to have expanded by 5.9 percent. A recovery in tourism, boosted the number but other sectors, such as farming and the construction sector grew at a slower rate, the director general of the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, Zachary Mwangi, said. “The tourism sector had a remarkable recovery as it benefited from improved security,” he said at the launch of the annual economic survey. He said the main risks facing economic growth this year were internal, after an acute drought depressed output in the first quarter and drove up food prices. “Key crop growing regions are expected to receive late and inadequate rains,” Mwangi said. Farming, including exports of tea and coffee, accounts for more than a quarter of annual output in the region’s largest economy. Most experts expect the economic expansion to slow down this year due to the drought and sluggish private sector credit growth. The World Bank said last week the economy is likely to grow by 5.5 percent in 2017. The shilling was expected to be stable this year, Mwangi said, attributing it to solid foreign exchange reserves held by the central bank and a sustainable current account deficit. The data released on Wednesday showed the current account deficit narrowed 11.9 percent last year to 5.2 percent of GDP. The overall balance of payments swung to a small surplus last year from a deficit in the previous year. In the tourism sector, visitor numbers rose to 1.34 million from 1.18 million the prior year, with earnings rising 17.8 percent to 99.7 billion shillings ($964.68 million), Mwangi said. Hotel room occupancy also rose. The information, communication and technology sector also grew at a faster pace, Mwangi said, thanks to growth in the number of mobile phone users and Internet subscriptions.

Ana de Pro, making her remarks from Madrid, said that Brexit – Britain leaving the European Union –would not affect her business ""that much… we are a truly global company and we operate everywhere,"" and though Brexit may have a short-term impact, it would not impact the travel industry in the long-run. ""Of course, it is a risk on certitude for a certain period of time and afterwards to see how things evolve,"" Pro told CNBC. ""Uncertainty and risk is never good for growth. That will have a negative impact but overall, the market is already discounting some things and I think once the panorama will be more clarified, things will be improving rather than the opposite,"" she added. Summer holiday bookings have been growing steadily, said Pro, with the travel industry overall witnessing a very strong performance in the first quarter of the year, ""probably favored by the low oil prices with airlines being able to reduce the prices."" Amadeus announced a partnership deal with travel giant Expedia.com at the beginning of the month. ""We invest heavily in technology because the travel industry today is all about technology … we work to be connected door-to-door,"" said de Pro.

1382624,This biz bounced back from near failure to sell over 1 million products,"Nate and Vanessa Quigley were in a position no entrepreneur ever wants to be in: They had personally invested ""several hundred thousand"" dollars in a company that was failing. The duo's start-up, a family memory and photo sharing platform, just wasn't catching on. And only after they tweaked the company's business model, did it begin to generate traction. ""We literally had the wandering around the kitchen at 3 o'clock in the morning because you can't sleep because you don't know what to do and you think you're going to lose all of your investors' money. That's where we were,"" Nate said. The couple knew they wanted to start a business to help people organize and share memories, but it took them two ""pivots"" or versions of the company to find an idea that clicked. Along the way, their start-up Folk Story would morph into Just Family and then into Chatbooks. Fast forward to today, and they are co-founders of Chatbooks, a photo book-making company that turns users' Instagram posts into books. After every 60 posts, the service automatically print a book of them and sends it to customers' homes for $8. To date, Chatbooks has sold more than 1 million photo books. In 2015, the company posted $5.9 million in revenue. Even as the company has grown, it's remained a family business in many ways. Nate is the company's CEO and Vanessa is the ""Chatbooker-in-Chief,"" a position that is a mash-up of spokeswoman, customer relations director and creative director. For the Quigley family, the difference between failure and success came down to learning from the mistakes of their previous ventures. Folk Story and Just Family laid the foundation for Chatbooks and sparked a crucial realization: People don't have time to adopt new habits. ""People are out of time and out of attention, and if your company's success depends on a bunch of people doing a new thing at the same time, it's just not going to work,"" Nate said. Instead of trying to engineer a new platform, they realized they would have more success if they met users were they already were. ""Building this new platform kind of implied that people had to leave wherever they were today and start doing this new thing. And Vanessa and a couple of our board members had the insight that rather than build this new platform, we should just build a utility to add additional value the platforms that people were already using like Instagram,"" he said. The mental shift was a game changer for the company, and in 2014, they pivoted to Chatbooks—a year after they thought their start-up would fail. Learning to listen to what Nate calls ""signals"" was crucial to surviving in the early days. ""There's a certain amount of you just have to block out a lot of negative noise that comes at you, but there are also certain signals that you somehow have to not block, that you have to hear,"" he said. ""You have to say 'Hold on, that's not just a naysayer that person is right and I want to figure out what that means for the start-up."" A signal, or important piece of feedback, could be negative or positive. ""The signal in all the noise is someone saying, 'I will pay for that tomorrow,'"" he said. For Nate and Vanessa, that signal came when Vanessa saw how much her toddler loved holding on to his photo album he got from preschool. She realized that instead of developing software for a new platform, the couple should make an existing process more enjoyable. ""It was a big 'Aha' moment,"" he said. The couple asked themselves a key question: ""What additional value can we give [people] with no additional effort? As soon as we kind of made that leap in our minds, it immediately took off,"" he said.",3.5

Jose Abreu is 5-for-10 and Cabrera 12-for-35 with a homer versus Santana, who was 2-2 with a 3.80 ERA in four starts against the White Sox last year. Quintana, who is coming off a career-high 13 wins, was disappointing in his season debut while allowing six runs on five hits (three homers) and three walks over 5 1/3 innings in a loss to Detroit. The 28-year-old from Colombia has made at least 32 starts the last four seasons and his 3.20 ERA in 2016 was also the best in his career. Brian Dozier boasts four homers and Joe Mauer is 12-or-37 with a blast against Quintana, who went 2-2 with a 3.98 ERA in five starts versus Minnesota last year. WALK-OFFS 1. Minnesota 3B Miguel Sano was held hitless for the first time this season Saturday after registering six RBIs in the first four games. 2. Chicago 3B Todd Frazier, who hit 40 homers last year, recorded his first hit of the season Saturday (1-for-15) and scored two runs. 3.

1397362,"Instagram accounts hacked, loaded with porn to lure users to dating sites","Hackers are infiltrating Instagram accounts and altering profiles to contain pornographic imagery that links to adult websites, security firm Symantec has found. Researchers found that the hacked Instagram accounts had sexual images, different profile biography, image and name, and new photos uploaded. Photos tell people to visit the link in a person's profile which is a shortened URL to a website. The attackers change the Instagram account's passwords. Symantec notes that accounts remain in the same state even after months, indicating that owners may have created new accounts since. Links in the profile link to a site controlled by the scammer. This site contains a survey suggesting that a woman has nude photos to share and the user will be directed to a website that offers ""quick sex"" rather than dating, Symantec said. The page only appears on mobile browser. On desktop, a user is directed to a random Facebook user profile. Once a user completes the survey, they are sent to an adult dating website and asked to sign up. Scammers are rewarded with a fee for each person that signs up. Social media sites from Instagram to Twitter have been plagued with fake accounts. All have reporting mechanisms to take them down. Symantec said it does not know how the accounts were compromised but that it is likely due to weak passwords and the use of one password across many sites. The security firm pointed to a hack earlier this year which saw over 600 million passwords stole and sold online. If hackers took some of those usernames and password and tried them on Instagram, they may have been able to access an account.",3.5
1400354,3 daily habits of the world's most successful people,"The Definitive Guide to Business Arnold Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilder turned actor turned Governor of California, and bestselling author Malcolm Gladwell don't seem to have a lot in common. They are both, however, indisputably successful. And they've both been on author and entrepreneur Tim Ferriss' podcast, ""The Tim Ferriss Show."" Ferriss, who wrote popular productivity book ""The 4-Hour Workweek, "" uses his podcast to talk to a range of successful people about how they've climbed to the top of their fields. He's noticed three daily habits that the most accomplished people have in common. The ability to focus is a prerequisite for being successful in any category, and Ferriss has learned that most successful people take active steps to quiet their minds. ""At least 80 percent of the people I have interviewed have some type of daily mindfulness practice,"" he says. ""That can take the form of meditation. That can take the form of some type of repetitive exercise. It can take the form of using a simple app, like Headspace. But that is one very consistent pattern."" Doing yoga can also be considered a form of mindfulness, depending on how it is practiced, says Ferriss. If you are spending an entire class obsessing about your to-do list for tomorrow or what your ex said on Facebook, then that isn't much of a mindfulness practice. If, however, you are focusing on your breath and body, then yoga can be a way to access mindfulness. The people who do awesome, impressive things are the people who think awesome, impressive thoughts. If you don't entertain ideas that are a little crazy, then you won't disrupt the status quo. ""These people who get outsized results in different areas often ask outsized questions that seem very absurd,"" says Ferriss. ""These people have developed the ability to ask bigger questions."" It was just that sort of extreme, out-of-the box thinking that led Ferriss to write his most famous book. ""In 'The 4-Hour Workweek' I asked, 'If you had a gun against your head and could only work two hours a day, what would you work on?'"" says Ferriss. ""And that type of thought exercise forces you to break your current thought patterns and habits."" The third commonality of the ultra-successful people that Ferriss has interviewed is that they all surround themselves with other ultra-successful people — people who challenge them to be the best version of themselves. ""They all spend time with people who kill their excuses,"" says Ferriss. For example, Laird Hamilton, who Ferriss calls ""the undisputed king of big wave surfing,"" is in his early 50s. And Hamilton is friends with Don Wildman, who, now in his 80s, was dubbed ""The World's Healthiest 75-Year-Old Man"" back in 2008. ""Hang out with someone 30 years older who is just crushing life,"" says Ferriss. ""Spend time with people who remove your excuses instead of reinforce them.""",2.5
1401374,"Pfizer strikes deal with Sangamo, broadening hemophilia pipeline","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc said on Wednesday it reached an agreement with Sangamo Therapeutics Inc for rights to its gene therapy programs to treat the rare blood-clotting disorder hemophilia A, under which Pfizer will pay $70 million upfront. Shares of Sangamo jumped 41 percent to $6.15 in after-the-bell trading. Sangamo will be eligible for potential milestone payments of up to $475 million and tiered double-digit royalties on net sales if the treatment is approved. Michael Goettler, global president of Pfizer Rare Disease, said the deal bolsters Pfizer’s pipeline in both gene therapy and hemophilia, noting that the company already has a collaboration for a hemophilia B treatment. “We have an intention to become a leader in gene therapy and this is another step,” he said in an interview. Sangamo is expected to begin human trials of one of its lead product candidates, SB-525, this quarter. Pfizer will fund and conduct any late-stage clinical trials. Hemophilia A is caused by a genetic mutation resulting in insufficient activity of Factor VIII, a blood-clotting protein the body uses to stop bleeding. There are approximately 16,000 patients in the United States and more than 150,000 worldwide with hemophilia A. Reporting by Michael Erman; Editing by Leslie Adler",4.5
1401519,Landmine kills eight in northeast Kenya - police,"MOMBASA, Kenya, June 27 (Reuters) - Four police officers and four civilians were killed on Tuesday after their truck hit a landmine on a road near Kenya’s border with Somalia, police officials said, in the second such attack this month. Another four police officers and one civilian died in a blast in northeast Kenya on June 16, while at least eight police officers were killed in two roadside bombings a month earlier. Somalia’s militant Islamist al Shabaab group claimed responsibility for the May attacks. “Four police officers and four children have been killed in an IED explosion in Lamu (county),” police spokesman Charles Owino said of Tuesday’s blast, without giving further details. Another security official in the area told Reuters the truck they were travelling in had run over a landmine in Kiunga, a town close to the border. There was no immediate claim of responsibiliity. Al Shabaab, which is fighting to overthrow Somalia’s government and impose its own harsh interpretation of Islamic Sharia law, has said it will continue to attack Kenya unless it withdraws its troops from an African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia.

1402844,Germany presses for changes in EU competition rules after Siemens/Alstom deal blocked,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Europe should change its competition rules to facilitate cross-border mergers and create European champions which can compete with rivals from China and the United States, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Wednesday. Siemens and Alstom’s plan to create a European rail champion collapsed on Wednesday after EU anti-trust regulators rejected the deal, saying that it would have hurt competition and led to higher prices for consumers. “We do respect the decision and the authority of the European Commission, but we are convinced that we must think about and decide on future changes of European competition rules,” Altmaier told reporters in Berlin. “I’ve agreed with my French colleague Bruno Le Maire that we will prepare a joint Franco-German initiative that is aimed at getting an up-to-date adjustment of European competition law.” Altmaier said he did not want to elaborate on competition issues in the specific case of Siemens and Alstom just hours after the European Commission’s decision on the case, but he hinted that he would like to see a second push for the merger. “I’ve been in contact for many weeks now with my French colleague, with the people in charge at the Commission as well as with the companies, and we will continue this work, and I am convinced that there is still a chance for a good and sustainable solution,” Altmaier said. “We still think it’s right for Europe to join forces, and we think it’s right that the two big companies work together in the field of rail technology and signaling technology in the railway sector, because only then are they will be big and strong enough to compete with other competitors worldwide,” Altmaier said.

1403638,Oracle and others want to crush this unicorn's social media empire,"It's tough when mammoth corporations rush in to copy a disruptor's success formula and grab market share. The entrepreneurial venture can only hope its first-to-market advantage will continue to give it an edge. Just ask the founders of Sprinklr, the New York-based start-up currently valued at $1.8 billion that created a new way to market to customers online through social media. After building a global business empire with more than 1,000 customers, Oracle, Adobe and Salesforce are acquiring start-ups to build rival businesses in the same niche. With the Sprinklr platform, which combines the data from 24 different social channels, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and more, a company can get a total view of what customers are saying about them and fine-tune their social media strategy from a single integrated dashboard. That model has helped Spinklr lure more than 1,000 customers, including big brands like Nike, Nasdaq, McDonald's and Samsung. ""More and more, customers are looking to engage with brands and companies through social media,"" said 451 research analyst Scott Denne. ""Sprinklr's logic in starting with social first is that it's the most important customer engagement channel."" Now Sprinklr is trying to scale its social media empire, even in an increasingly crowded field of competitors with deeper pockets who are copying elements of what has made Sprinklr successful. ""We're trying to build the next big enterprise software giant,"" said Sprinklr founder and CEO Ragy Thomas. Since its founding in 2009, Sprinklr has been on a fast track of growth by taking venture capital and acquiring other start-ups. In July, Sprinklr raised more funding, a $105 million round that brings the total amount it's raised to $239 million and increased the company's valuation from $1.1 billion to just over $1.8 billion. Just this month, Sprinklr integrated into its platform the Japanese smartphone portal Line, which 220 million users worldwide rely on to make calls, send mobile payments and play social games. Even as it's grown, Sprinklr's kept its focus on social media, expanding the functionality of its platform to offer a spectrum of tools for social media marketing, advertising, e-commerce, customer interaction, social listening and analytics. Along the way, it has added staff and offices — more than 1,200 employees at 13 offices worldwide — and gained expertise in the social space that has enabled Sprinklr to outmaneuver bigger competitors. ""The benefit to procuring Sprinklr, one of the last remaining independent social technology companies, is that ideally you're getting a higher level of expertise and best-in-class functionality for everything social,"" said Forrester vice president and principal analyst Melissa Parrish. But competitors like Oracle, Adobe and Salesforce have been acquiring smaller companies to add functionality similar to Sprinklr's to their current marketing software. In 2012, Oracle acquired Vitrue, a company that enables social listening and engagement, analyzes what customers are saying on social media in real time and allows for the publishing of content on social sites. That same year, Salesforce acquired Buddy Media, a social media marketing platform that lets marketing teams publish content, place social advertising and measure how well their social marketing campaigns are working. This past May, Adobe upgraded its social capabilities by acquiring the online commenting platform Livefyre. Facebook, too, is in the mix: Since releasing its chatbot platform for its Messenger app in April, Facebook has seen more than 11,000 chatbots created, and many work to connect brands directly to consumers. Up for grabs is a huge market for social media marketing. By 2020, according to 451 Research's Market Monitor, big brands and companies will spend more than $3.2 billion on software tools to manage their social media marketing, monitoring and outreach. According to Thomas, his company has already surpassed the $100 million annual revenue mark. ""All those companies want to own social for marketers. But there's not a defined set of what those tools should look like,"" Parrish said. ""What Sprinklr is doing is trying to remain independent while owning all of those social functions."" To do that, Sprinklr has completed its own share of acquisitions — nine over the past two years. But instead of selling new software picked up through each acquisition as a separate point solution, Sprinklr adds the functionality to its core platform, oftentimes remaking the purchased technology or tailoring it to fit individual brands' needs. It's one reason why Sprinklr was able to pick up Starwood Hotels and Resorts, which had been using Salesforce to manage its 3,000 social media accounts, as a client. ""Sprinklr has basically outscaled everybody else,"" said Denne. ""Their play is to be a broader customer engagement platform."" But according to analysts who watch the social marketing field, challenges abound, even for a unicorn company like Sprinklr. There are certain capabilities that don't fit into Sprinklr's platform right now, like a content management system for companies to run their websites, which today are content publishing platforms that also dabble in the same types of personalization services made popular by social media. ""I would say that Sprinklr currently has the most bells and whistles, but I wouldn't call them — or anyone — a one-stop platform for social marketing needs yet,"" Parrish said. ""Simply having features doesn't mean that those features are best-in-class for every single thing a marketer needs to do."" Vendor-hopping, where a marketer might go swap in and out different marketing software every year, is also common. A company that wins a client away from a competitor could be just as likely to lose that client when their contract is up, especially when there are roughly 3,500 different marketing technologies for big brands to choose from, according to Scott Brinker, editor in chief of the Chief Marketing Technologist blog since 2008. ""For most companies of any scale, they need to unify social media marketing and monitoring for building campaigns,"" he said. ""But there is not a single product that does all of this for them."" Thomas would argue that the Sprinklr platform is intended to be that product. He calls it the ""omnichannel front office."" The thinking is that brands shouldn't use separate marketing and advertising software applications to interact with customers. In Sprinklr's worldview, customers aren't data points but rather individuals. A single platform that lets a big brand get a complete picture of how individual consumers are talking about them will be more helpful to marketing teams, according to Thomas. His next move is to marry the new world of social video, photo and text to the old world of customer call centers and databases to create one consistent experience between customers and brands. And to keep growing the Sprinklr platform into what he refers to as an ""omnichannel"" front office. ""Our end game is very clear,"" said Thomas. ""We want to build one integrated platform for the front office."" — By Andrew Zaleski, special to CNBC.com",4.0
1404864,Switzerland regrets Thai decision not to extradite Swiss national linked to 1MDB  probe,"Switzerland said it regrets a decision by Thai authorities not to extradite Swiss national Xavier Justo, a possible key witness in the global money-laundering probe linked to Malaysian state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). Malaysia's 1MDB, once a pet project of Prime Minister Najib Razak who chaired its advisory board, is the subject of money-laundering investigations in at least six countries, including Switzerland, Singapore and the United States. Justo was jailed for three years in Thailand in August 2015 after the police said he admitted to blackmail and attempting extortion of his former employer Petrosaudi, a Saudi Arabia-based oil and gas company and joint venture partner of 1MDB. Justo leaked several confidential documents from Petrosaudi relating to its joint venture with 1MDB that were published by Malaysian and international media groups early last year, and formed the basis for the graft and money laundering probe. His sentence was cut to two years by a royal amnesty in August, prompting the Swiss authorities to request his transfer to serve the remaining term back home. Thai Justice Minister Gen Paiboon Koomchaya was quoted telling Malaysian state news agency Bernama that the decision to deny Justo's transfer was made ""in accordance with Thai law"". The Swiss foreign office said it took note of the decision with ""regret"". ""Switzerland has not yet been officially informed by the Thai authorities of the decision to refuse the transfer to Switzerland,"" it said in a statement to Reuters. Justo's lawyer in Thailand, Worrasit Piriyawiboon, said his client was not extradited because he has less than one year of his sentence left to serve. The decision to reject Justo's transfer to Switzerland came shortly after Malaysia's prime minister concluded a visit to Thailand. Both countries have denied any interference. Najib's press secretary said in a statement late on Tuesday that no one from the Malaysian delegation raised any matter relating to Justo during the Thai visit. ""Malaysia does not sanction attempts to interfere with the internal affairs or judicial process of other countries,"" Tengku Sariffuddin said in a statement. The U.S. Justice Department filed lawsuits earlier this year seeking to seize more than $1 billion of assets allegedly siphoned off from 1MDB, founded in September 2009 to invest in strategic property and energy projects. Najib has denied any wrongdoing and said Malaysia will cooperate with the international investigations. More than 200,000 people marched through the streets of Kuala Lumpur in August 2015 calling for Najib's resignation over the 1MDB scandal, and another protest rally is planned for November this year.

1405393,Cramer gets to the bottom of whether Twitter is really worth buying now,"With news that Twitter could potentially be sold to Salesforce.com, Alphabet or other unknown suitors, Jim Cramer was faced with a classic dilemma. ""Left to its own devices, Twitter should be lower, perhaps appreciably lower because it doesn't have growth and growth is the magic elixir that's required for all tech companies,"" the ""Mad Money "" host said. Cramer has argued in the past that if Twitter's management thought bigger and made the platform easier to use, it could be so much more than what it is now. It could be used for the ultimate customer relations tool. ""It could be, shy of Facebook, the best way to get in touch with and learn from and teach customers about your product and what it can mean for them in a totally positive and intelligent way, "" Cramer said. After the news broke, many critics questioned why any company would pay for a company like Twitter with such slow growth. Cramer was inspired by the tweet of Vala Afshar, chief digital evangelist of Salesforce, who explained that Twitter has a personal learning network, the best real-time content for news, democratized intelligence and is a place to promote others. ""These are all the reasons why Twitter would be a great acquisition for any company trying to build a 360 degree, 24-7 relationship with its customers,"" Cramer said. These four reasons are also why a Microsoft, Oracle, Verizon, Salesforce, SAP or Alphabet should be interested in acquiring Twitter, he added. However, it also makes the potential transaction very costly for the acquirer. The problem is that Twitter has a massive amount of information, it just doesn't take advantage of it. It doesn't think about what it could do for targeted advertising. ""Everything comes at a price, and buying Twitter at these levels will crater earnings for at least several years while the business is fixed to bring in the kind of revenue I believe it can generate,"" Cramer said. Ultimately, Cramer determined that it would be tough to get behind Twitter right now because it can only be recommended on a takeover basis. The fundamentals don't support its current valuation, though it is worth a great deal to some. ""If you own Twitter, understand it's in rarefied territory and I am thinking it's four, five points up, and three down down if nothing materializes,"" Cramer said. Questions for Cramer?

1406288,New Alabama law could shutter two abortion clinics near schools,"(Reuters) - Alabama Governor Robert Bentley signed new abortion restrictions into law on Thursday, limiting the proximity of clinics to public schools and banning a procedure used to terminate pregnancies in the second trimester, local media reported. The Republican governor signed two anti-abortion laws, according to the Montgomery Advertiser and other local outlets. One prevents state health officials from issuing or renewing the licenses of abortion clinics within 2,000 feet of public schools serving students in grades kindergarten through eight. Advocates said the measure would protect students from exposure to anti-abortion demonstrations. The measure could force the closure of two clinics in Huntsville and Tuscaloosa, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama. Their licenses would not be renewed in the coming months under the new law, said Susan Watson, executive director of the state ACLU, which intends to challenge the measure in court. “It would really reduce the access in the northern part of Alabama,” she said, noting that some women would be closer to Tennessee than the state’s other clinics. Under the law, Alabama could be reduced to three abortion clinics, she said. The restriction comes amid a wave of laws being adopted by states as conservatives seek to chip away at the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision to legalize abortion. Restricting abortion clinics based on proximity to a school represents an approach not yet seen in other states, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks reproductive health policy. Alabama also on Thursday became the fifth state to restrict an abortion method commonly performed in the second trimester of a pregnancy, known as dilation and evacuation or D&E. Opponents call it dismemberment abortion. The two Alabama clinics affected by the school restriction are also the only ones performing the procedure in the state, according to the ACLU, which plans another legal challenge. Kansas and Oklahoma enacted such bans last year, which are being challenged in court and not in effect. This year, similar restrictions were signed into law in Mississippi and West Virginia, according to the Guttmacher Institute.",4.0

The court left in place a September ruling by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that went against the banks, which had challenged the 2015 award on multiple grounds. Lawyers for Nomura and RBS could not immediately be reached for comment. The award stemmed from a lawsuit brought against Nomura and RBS by the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2011. The FHFA has acted as conservator of mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac since their 2008 takeover by the federal government after the collapse of the U.S. housing market. The lawsuit was one of 18 brought by the FHFA that year over some $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that banks sold Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. All the other lawsuits have been settled. The FHFA has recovered more than $23 billion from the settlements, including $5.5 billion from RBS in a different lawsuit, $5.83 billion from Bank of America Corp and $4 billion from JPMorgan Chase & Co. Following a non-jury trial, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote ruled in 2015 against Nomura, which sponsored $2 billion of securities sold to Fannie and Freddie, and RBS, which underwrote four of the deals. She ruled that the offering documents for the securities did not correctly describe the underlying mortgages and ordered the banks to pay $806 million. The banks later agreed to pay another $33 million for costs and attorneys’ fees, subject to the outcome of their appeal. Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham and Frances Kerry",3.0

Chinese package delivery company ZTO Express debuted on the stock market Thursday morning, opening at $18.40 a share before falling more than 15 percent. The stock ended the day at $16.57. The stock market debut, the biggest by a Chinese company since the $25 billion IPO of e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014, gave the Shanghai-based company a market value of more than $12 billion. ZTO priced 72.1 million shares at $19.50 a share, above its previously indicated range of $16.50 to $18.50 a share. The debut comes as the U.S. IPO market was picking up after stock-market volatility brought it to a standstill for the first few months of the year. Through Thursday afternoon, U.S.-listed IPOs have raised $20.6 billion, which means 2016 is on track to be the slowest in six years, Dealogic data shows.

Despite the disappoting debute, the company is still excited about the big offering and the focus is on the long term, a ZTO spokesman said. The interest, analysts tell CNBC, comes from the access to the both the Chinese consumer and the Chinese e-commerce industry.

After clocking 6.9 percent in the first quarter thanks to spending on infrastructure and a property boom that policymakers want to rein in, analysts surveyed by Reuters reckon economic growth will just about make Beijing’s target of 2017 of 6.5 percent as it slows over the rest of the year. Massive debt - standing at nearly 300 percent of GDP - and serious budgetary imbalances mean Beijing can’t carry on pump priming. The brakes went on in April, when annual growth in fiscal spending dropped to 3.8 percent from 21 percent the first quarter. And worries about speculative bubbles have forced the central bank to tighten short term liquidity, while trying to keep medium term funding available for investment. “Noticing how serious policymakers seem to be at the moment about reining in financial risks, it’s not impossible we’re going to see a significantly lower economic growth target next year,” said Louis Kuijs, an economist at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong. Scope for further tightening in monetary policy could be limited if economic growth became uncomfortably slow. “I don’t think we’re going to see much more additional tightening… but the risks now are on the downside,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics in Singapore. Trying to generate growth through exports by letting the yuan depreciate isn’t an option, due to concern about capital flight that saw foreign exchange reserves fall below $3 trillion earlier this year, and the worry that it could provoke the Trump administration into some kind of retaliation. Policymakers want to move the economy onto a path where consumer spending becomes the main driver, but it’s not there yet. “Consumption has been very steady and that has been a huge benefit - it has been a very nice buffer,” said Kuijs. “But in my view, unlike in the United States where consumption by itself can drive the cycle, I would argue that in China, that is not yet really possible...because consumption is still following on to what is happening in investment and wages.” Household spending only accounted for 37.1 percent of China’s economy in 2015, according to World Bank data. While that is up from a low of 35.8 percent in 2007, it is far below the 54.2 percent average for middle income countries. And spending is looking soft, at least by Chinese standards. Automobile sales rose 4.6 percent in the first four months of 2017, about three-quarters the pace of a year ago. Movie ticket sales, flagged as a sign of China’s growing consumer class, stalled last year and have been mixed this year. Annual retail sales growth eased to 10.7 percent in April, and has been on gradual downtrend since 2010, when it notched over 18 percent. Consumption, on a per capita basis, is growing slower than GDP. And the industrial side of the economy is also slowing.    Producer prices fell in April for the first time in seven months, trade data showed a surprising slowdown in imports, and surveys of manufacturing and service-sector activity were weaker than expected. April data released on Monday for factory output and fixed asset investment also showed growth slowed from March. There has been some progress on deleveraging. While new credit was a record 6.94 trillion yuan ($1.01 trillion) in the first quarter this year, as a proportion of GDP it fell to 38.4 percent from 41.3 percent a year earlier. “We must push deleveraging,” said Tang Jianwei, senior economist at Bank of Communications in Shanghai. “We cannot go back to the old road if we feel pain. The economic transformation is still going on and deleveraging has just started.” Graphic: China monthly economic activity indicators - reut.rs/2rli8qV Reporting by Elias Glenn; additional reporting by Kevin Yao; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore",3.0

1423387,China's growth 'reassuring' for 'weak and vulnerable' global economy: Xinhua,"China will meet its growth target of 6.5 percent to 7 percent growth this year, a reassuring sign for a ""weak and vulnerable"" global economy, state news agency Xinhua said in a commentary on Monday. Xinhua noted a ""troublesome start"" to 2016, probably referring to a sharp fall in the yuan and worry about China's slowing economy roiling markets worldwide. The yuan remains weak after foreign reserves fell more than expected in November. Nor would maintaining stable growth be easy for China in 2017, Xinhua said, ""given persistently weak external demand, ongoing deleveraging and capacity-reduction pressure, and a slowing property sector"". But, unlike other countries, China has the flexibility to ward off sharp economic decline as it restructures its economy towards consumption and services, the Xinhua article said. It warned that trading partners would only have access to China's home market if similar access was given by other countries, a nod to growing protectionist sentiment around the world, a worrying trend for the world's largest exporter. China may target economic growth of about 6.5 percent next year, Reuters has reported, still higher than most other major economies, but if that slowdown in growth did occur, others would need China ""more than ever"", the article said.

1424671,Facebook to prohibit private firearm transactions on its service,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc prohibited global users from coordinating person-to-person private sales of firearms on its online social network and its Instagram photo-sharing service on Friday, countering concerns that it was increasingly being used to circumvent background checks on gun purchases. The move comes as the United States debates the issue of access to guns after a string of mass shootings. U.S. President Barack Obama has urged social media companies to clamp down on gun sales organized on their platforms. It updates Facebook’s regulated goods policy, introduced in March 2014, that banned people from selling marijuana, pharmaceuticals and illegal drugs. Facebook already prohibited private firearms sellers from advertising “no background check required,” or offering transactions across U.S. state lines without a licensed dealer because the company said such posts indicated a willingness to evade the law. Licensed retailers will still be able to advertise firearms on Facebook that lead to transactions outside of Facebook’s service, the spokeswoman said. “Over the last two years, more and more people have been using Facebook to discover products and to buy and sell things to one another,” Monika Bickert, Facebook’s head of product policy, said in a statement. “We are continuing to develop, test, and launch new products to make this experience even better for people and are updating our regulated goods policies to reflect this evolution,” Bickert said. Facebook is the world’s most popular online social network, with 1.59 billion users across the globe, 219 million of them in the United States and Canada. The National Rifle Association, a lobbying group opposed to limits on U.S. gun ownership rights, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Groups advocating increased gun control applauded the new policy. “Moms are grateful for the leadership shown by Facebook today,” said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a part of the Everytown for Gun Safety campaign group. “Our continued relationship with Facebook resulted in today’s even stronger stance, which will prevent dangerous people from getting guns and save American lives.”",2.5
1427236,"Facing criticism, Saudi Arabia to pay private sector bills on time","Saudi Arabia's Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan has pledged that all private sector payments will be made within a 60-day time frame, as the country seeks greater investment as part of its ""Vision 2030"" strategy. Al-Jadaan hopes that the new commitment will reassure private sector investors that Saudi Arabia will make good on its liabilities after facing criticism in the past over delayed payments. ""Payments are happening on time,"" Al-Jadaan told CNBC at the World Economic Forum, adding ""we actually announced, in writing, a commitment from the government that will pay every single use of the private sector within 60 days and that is happening without a single default on that position."" ""There have been some delays in the past because I think that governments in 2015 wanted to make sure that they look at their liabilities generally. That took a bit longer than what is expected. We are now on track,"" he said. Vision 2030 is a ""strategic roadmap"" setting out how the country intends to diversify its economy over the next 13 years. By 2030 it hopes to no longer be so heavily dependent on oil exports to fuel its economy, particularly given its susceptibility to price fluctuations. Instead, it is hoping for the private sector to contribute 65 percent to the country's overall GDP. In particular, Saudi Arabia aims to transform its public investment fund into a sovereign wealth fund that would be ""the first and the largest in the world, or at least one of the three largest in the world,"" said Al-Jadaan. He aimed to reassure international investors that the 2017 budget, announced in December 2016, sets out a gradual transition for the country. ""We know that you want certainty.

1428447,"Amazon to scrap e-book clauses, wants to settle EU antitrust probe","U.S. online retailer Amazon has offered to scrap some clauses from its e-book deals with publishers, the European Commission said on Tuesday, a move aimed at ending an EU antitrust investigation and avoid a possible fine. Amazon, Europe's biggest e-book distributor, will not force publishers to offer terms and conditions, such as on wholesale prices, business models and e-book catalogues, similar to those they have agreed with Amazon's rivals. The Commission has concerns that such parity clauses make it harder for other e-book retailers to compete with Amazon by developing new and innovative products and services. The EU competition enforcer said rivals and customers have a month to provide feedback before it decides whether to accept the proposal. Under EU antitrust rules, such settlements mean no finding of infringement nor fines which could reach 10 percent of a company's global turnover. Amazon said it was pleased with the agreement but disagreed with the Commission's preliminary assessment, saying that e-books are not a separate market as they compete directly with print books and other forms of media.",3.5

The firm shared which companies will benefit or lose if the tax passes, according to its analysis. ""As investors await the details for the proposed tax plan, President Trump has made it clear that protectionism is a key tenet of his administration,"" strategist Keith Parker wrote in a note to clients Thursday. ""Overall, we see BAT as a low probability but potentially very high impact event, though politics are fluid and plan details/possibilities will shift."" BAT is a part of the House Republicans' current tax reform proposal. It aims to generate funds to offset a large corporate tax rate reduction by taxing imports. The strategist said the GOP plan to reduce corporate tax rates to 20 percent from 35 percent will boost earnings by 12 percentage points, but the implementation of the BAT will detract 6 percentage points from the lower tax rate benefit. In terms of sectors, Parker said the BAT would hurt retail, food, staples, consumer goods, autos and communication equipment companies. On the flip side, capital goods, defense, materials and chemical names will do relatively better due to their higher levels of domestic production. For investors who want to trade the prospect of the BAT being implemented, here are five companies Barclays says will benefit from the proposal.",4.5

1437482,Trump aides’ bid to plug leaks creates unease among some civil servants,"President Donald Trump's Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin used his first senior staff meeting last month to tell his new aides he would not tolerate leaks to the news media, sources familiar with the matter said. Current and former officials said that in a departure from past practice, access to a classified computer system at the White House has been tightened by political appointees to prevent professional staffers from seeing memos being prepared for the new president. And at the Department of Homeland Security, some officials told Reuters they fear a witch hunt is under way for the leaker of a draft intelligence report which found little evidence that citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries covered by Trump's now-suspended travel ban pose a threat to the United States. Washington career civil servants say the clampdown appears designed to try to limit the flow of information inside and outside government and deter officials from talking to the media about topics that could result in negative stories. Some reports of government dysfunction have infuriated Trump just weeks into his presidency. Trump has described media outlets as ""lying"", ""corrupt"", ""failing"" and ""the enemy of the American people."" At a Feb. 16 news conference, Trump said: ""The leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake"" and that he had asked the Department of Justice to look into leaks of ""classified information that was given illegally"" to journalists regarding the relationship between his aides and Russia. Several officials in different agencies who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said some employees fear their phone calls and emails may be monitored and that they are reluctant to speak their minds during internal discussions. In addition, the sources say that limits imposed on the flow of information have blindsided cabinet-level officials on some major issues and led to uncertainty among foreign governments about U.S. policy. In perhaps the most trenchant effort to deter leaks, White House spokesman Sean Spicer demanded that some aides there surrender their phones so they could be checked for calls or texts to reporters, Politico reported on Sunday. Word of the inspection quickly leaked. Two sources familiar with Mnuchin's first meeting with senior Treasury staff said he told them that their telephone calls and emails could be monitored to prevent leaks. One of the sources said that staff were told that monitoring could become policy. Asked about Mnuchin's comments to his senior staff, a Treasury spokesman said: ""Secretary Mnuchin had a discussion with staff about confidential information not being shared with the media nor any other sources. In the course of that conversation, the idea of checking phones was not discussed."" Asked in a follow-up email whether Mnuchin had raised the possibility of monitoring phones or emails as a matter of policy, the Treasury spokesman replied: ""It was not discussed."" Attempts by Republican and Democratic presidents to limit leaks are not new. During Republican Richard Nixon's administration, the FBI wiretapped White House aides and journalists. Trump's predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama, aggressively pursued leaks to try to ""control the narrative,"" as White House aides put it. New York Times reporter James Risen, whose articles led to investigations of leaks, said the Obama administration prosecuted nine cases involving whistleblowers and leakers, compared with three by all previous administrations combined. Leonard Downie, a former executive editor of the Washington Post, said it was too early to make historical comparisons, and that it is rare to learn about an administration's internal efforts to impose message discipline. At the State Department, the fear of getting caught in a leak investigation or running afoul of White House positions is so acute that some officials will discuss issues only face-to-face rather than use phones, email, texts or other messaging applications, two State Department officials said. ""There is a climate of intimidation, not just about talking to reporters, but also about communicating with colleagues,"" said one official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Acting State Department spokesman Mark Toner did not respond directly to the officials' statements but said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson aimed to foster an open climate where new ideas are raised and considered on their merits. ""There does have to be some degree of trust among colleagues in order to have those kinds of conversations,"" Toner said. There also is high anxiety in parts of DHS, officials there said. ""The atmosphere has become toxic, and that is not conducive to the work,"" said a DHS official on condition of anonymity. They said officials fear phone calls and emails are being monitored to try to find who leaked the draft intelligence report to the Associated Press. The report found that being a citizen of countries covered by Trump's Jan. 27 temporary immigration ban - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - was ""an unreliable indicator of terrorist threat."" The Homeland Security Department did not respond to three requests for comment. Some examples of how the administration is trying to limit the flow of information are relatively subtle, but significant. Before Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, National Security Council officials drafting memos, or ""packages,"" for the president on a classified computer system could choose other officials who should have input. Under a change made after Trump took office, staffers cannot choose who may see and edit a memo. Instead, access is approved by the office of the NSC executive secretary, retired Army lieutenant general Keith Kellogg. Asked about the new restrictions, National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton said: ""President Trump takes very seriously the criminal release of classified information critical to U.S. national security. Access procedures are designed to ensure that appropriate personnel see material relevant to their duties, while protecting sensitive information."" One U.S. official called the new system ""inefficient,"" saying Kellogg's office may not know who has ""equities"" in a given issue and may not share the drafts widely enough. Another administration official said the White House changed the access procedures about a month ago in reaction to leaks of the contents of Trump's conversations with the president of Mexico and the prime minister of Australia. ""It was changed in response to two very significant leaks,"" said the administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""This was a reactive move on the NSC's part."" Asked if the change had made the NSC less efficient, this official replied: ""No, because we are being conscientious about ensuring that all relevant staff members and experts are included on materials that they need to see."" Steven Aftergood of the nonprofit Federation of American Scientists' Project on Government Secrecy, which works to limit official secrecy, said the policy change suggested the White House wants to tighten control over internal deliberations. ""Why would it do that? Perhaps in order to discourage leaks. Or perhaps it lacks confidence and trust in the existing NSC staff,"" said Aftergood. ""From a management perspective, this move seems like a mistake. ""Restricting information workflow this way adds friction to the deliberative process, making it more cumbersome and less responsive,"" he added. ""Inferior policy decisions are a likely result.""

1438429,UPDATE 1-CEZ chief says company might split into two -Lidove Noviny,"(Adds further company comment, minister comment, Europe examples) PRAGUE, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Czech electricity producer CEZ could split into two parts in the future, one responsible for enlarging nuclear power plants, and the other focusing on new sources of energy, Chief Executive Daniel Benes told Lidove Noviny newspaper. European utilities have struggled as a result of weak wholesale electricity prices, forcing some such as German groups E.ON or RWE to hive off healthier parts of their businesses. CEZ’s profits have declined since the global economic crisis of 2008-09 and it has been making a push into renewable and other new energy businesses while also selling older coal-fired plants and focusing on upgraded units. It is also looking to expand its nuclear power fleet but has run into financing issues after failing to secure price guarantees from the state, its 70 percent owner. Benes told Lidove Noviny that talks with the government on a possible future structure of CEZ, central Europe’s largest listed utility, were only just starting. “Either we find a compromise and we will fulfill all the targets in an optimal way, or the shareholders come to a conclusion that it is better to follow the path on which the company could split for example,” Benes was quoted as saying in the article published on Friday. “This debate with politicians is only just beginning and it is not clear at all, how it will end.” A CEZ spokesman said there was no time frame yet. “We have presented possibilities to them (government)... it can even stay as it is now, eventually,” spokesman Ladislav Kriz said. Talks on CEZ’s future shape could take more than a year based on the German experience. Komercni Banka analysts said they did not expect any decisions before national elections in October. Benes cited RWE and E.ON as one model and said the state could hold a smaller majority stake in the new energy business. Industry Minister Jan Mladek, a member of Social Democrat party, supported the idea of a split, according to the paper. Finance Minister Andrej Babis, whose ministry controls the state’s holding in CEZ and who is leader of the ANO party that looks on course to win in the October elections, did not answer the paper’s request for comment. Babis has said in the past CEZ should finance its nuclear power expansion. CEZ cancelled a multi-billion dollar tender to enlarge its Temelin nuclear power plant in 2014 because of financing risks after the government refused to provide power price guarantees. Both CEZ and the state are looking to expand the country’s existing nuclear plants in the future but have not yet agreed on how to finance this. (Reporting by Robert Muller Writing by Jason Hovet.

""I am committed to fulfilling the oath that I took, which is upholding the law of the land,"" Price said during a House Appropriations Committee hearing on the Trump administration's proposed health department budget. But Democrats pressed the health secretary on whether he's committed to upholding both the letter and the spirit of the law, or whether he'll be using his discretion to undermine regulations, such as not enforcing the individual mandate or not promoting Obamacare enrollment. In January, the Trump administration cut advertising for Obamacare enrollment in the final weeks of the sign-up period for 2017 plans. ""Do you intend to halt advertising again this year — yes or no?"" asked ranking member Rose DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut. ""I haven't had any discussions about that. That was done prior to my arrival,"" Price replied. When pressed about whether he'll maintain funding for advertising this year, he said ""what we're committed to is making certain that the American people have access to affordable coverage. "" ""Will you continue that effort to disallow advertising to let people know about enrollment?"" DeLauro pressed in a follow-up question. ""As I said, we're committed to making certain that every American has access to affordable coverage,"" Price replied, adding that he ""wouldn't commit to any specific entity because many of these things that are allegedly increasing the coverage don't."" Price also avoided specifically saying whether he would support and enforce the ACA's essential health benefits requirement that includes maternity benefits. ""What we believe is it's important for every single American to be able to choose to buy the coverage they want,"" he said. When asked about the administration's commitment to funding cost-sharing subsidies, which help fund out-of-pocket costs for low-income Obamacare enrollees, the secretary said he was not able to comment. Insurers have argued that the cost-sharing funds are key to maintaining stability in the exchange market. During his confirmation hearings last month, Democrats criticized Price over investments in health-care companies he made while he promoted legislation as a congressman. Under questioning, Price said he has complied with his pledge to divest those investments.

1451134,Qatar says labor reforms will benefit migrant workers,"DOHA (Reuters) - The Qatari government on Monday vowed that labor law reforms to make it easier for migrant workers to change jobs and leave the country would bring “tangible benefits” and urged patience from critics who say the proposed changes are inadequate. The new law comes into effect on Tuesday in Qatar - which is spending billions of dollars on building new infrastructure ahead of hosting the 2022 soccer World Cup - but rights groups say foreign workers will still be vulnerable to abuse. The gas-rich Gulf state is one of the wealthiest in the world but its treatment of foreign workers from countries like India, Nepal and Bangladesh has come under scrutiny as it prepares for the games. “The new law is the latest step towards improving and protecting the rights of every expatriate worker in Qatar,” Labour Minister Issa al-Nuami said in a statement. A work-sponsorship system known as “Kefala” currently requires all foreign workers to obtain their employer’s consent to travel abroad or switch jobs, a measure rights groups say leaves workers prone to exploitation and forced labor. The reforms will establish the creation of state-run “grievance committees” to which workers can appeal if employers deny them permission. They will also allow workers who have completed contracts to change jobs freely and imposes fines of up to 25,000 riyal ($6,865.87) on businesses who confiscate employees’ passports. Amnesty International said in a statement that the new law would “barely scratch the surface of an abusive system”. The campaign group called on Qatar to abolish exit permits altogether and ban passport confiscation. “We urge the international community not to draw any definitive conclusions until there has been time to see the new law in action,” al-Nuami said. Qatar is building hotels, a port, a financial district and several football stadiums linked by desert highways as part of a $200 billion construction boom funded by natural gas revenues that have declined since global oil prices fell in mid-2014. A workforce of 2.1 million foreigners outnumbers Qatari citizens by about 10 to one. Unions and labor protests are banned. Japesh, an Indian construction worker waving traffic past a building site in Doha on Monday welcomed the reforms but said he would wait to see if the rules were enforced. “They [our bosses] told us before that things would improve but last month our passports were taken and our pay was delayed again,” he said.

1455259,Are you the family bank?,"Have you saved and invested responsibly? Then guess what? You're likely to become your family's bank. In fact, the more financially responsible you are, the more likely other family members will turn to you for financial support at some point, according to a Merrill Lynch report, titled Family & Retirement: The Elephant in the Room. According to the Merrill Lynch report, that financial support may be to meet a relative's one-time need, say a down payment on a house, or it could be ongoing assistance over the course of many years, say college tuition or perhaps cell phone bills. And that financial help, which averages $14,900 among people with less than $5 million in investable assets, could be for adult children, grandchildren, parents and in-laws and siblings, cousins and the like. Now don't despair if you are in fact the family bank. According to the Merrill Lynch report, some six in 10 people age 50+ today are providing financial support to family members. But what should give you cause for worry is this: Most family bankers provide financial support without expecting or asking for anything in return. And that could put your own retirement risk. So, what might you consider if you are family bank? Some family bankers can give or lend money without worry. But some may find giving or lending money comes at a cost -- a less comfortable retirement lifestyle. So, find out first before lending or giving money if you're putting your own retirement risk and, if so, do so knowing the risks. ""People who find themselves in the role of 'family bank' should determine how much they've been giving in family support, or plan to give, and then weigh this in the context of their retirement goals,"" says Kevin Crain, head of workplace financial solutions at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""Family giving is a critical, though often hidden, cost of retirement that must be factored into a broader financial plan."" Crain recommends asking yourself the following questions: Will current giving levels still leave you with a steady cushion for retirement? Or, can they potentially put your later-in-life aspirations in jeopardy? Unsure of the risks and consequences of being the family bank? Consider speaking with a financial professional to determine the level of support that will be feasible given your retirement plan, and earmark funds for that purpose, says Crain. ""Determine in advance how much you can commit to family support without compromising your current and future needs, and set out to stick to this amount,"" he says. ""Be clear about what you can afford to do, and do not make gifts or loans that will then later get you into trouble,"" says Anna Rappaport, president of a retirement consulting firm bearing her name and a fellow with the Society of Actuaries. Crain shares that point of view. ""Generous family members should set clear ground-rules that outline those circumstances when they would, or wouldn't, feel comfortable giving or lending money,"" he says. ""Not only does this avoid tensions down the road, but it can also instill positive financial behaviors among family members for the long-term."" Conduct a family inventory and think through who is out there, what their needs are and who may well be asking for help, says Rappaport. ""Think about the family overall,"" she says. ""A number of people may ask for, or need, help including siblings, children, grandchildren and even former spouses."" ""Is the individual who needs help doing enough on their own?"" asks Rappaport. ""You may feel very different about helping a child who has lost a job or has a severe illness but who has worked hard and acted prudently than about helping a family member who you feel acted imprudently to get into trouble."" Rappaport also suggests examining how you'll give/lend money if you have several children. ""Do you try to give to them based on need, merit or keeping things equal and balanced?"" she asks. ""Same question for grandchildren."" Also consider what's better: a loan or a gift. If someone is in trouble, determine how you would encourage them to get themselves out of trouble. ""For example, if they bought a house they can't afford, how can they sell it and downsize, vs. looking for continuing support?"" she asks. For his part, Crain says a family member who made personal compromises to overcome a difficult financial situation may be more likely to avoid a similar bind in the future. ""While it can be tempting to open your wallet to a family member in need, depending on the scenario, there may also be ways to support the family member beyond direct financial help – such as working with them to find a lower-cost apartment, or suggesting temporary adjustments to spending,"" he says. For people seeking a loan or a gift from a family member, Rappaport recommends asking yourself the following questions: Have I done what I can to help myself? How do I manage my affairs so I do not help the next time? Is this a reasonable request? If a loan, have I structured so I can reasonably pay it back? Am I putting my family member in a difficult position? ""Above all, it's critical to look to family financial conversations not as one-off requests, but as part of honest and ongoing conversations you should be having with family about important financial topics,"" says Crain. ""This not only lets the family member know of potential financial concerns well in advance, but also gives them a deeper window into your financial situation and your reasons for needing support."" Most importantly, he says, it gives families a chance to work together to explore options and solutions well before an emergency hits. In addition, when asking a family member for financial support, Crain suggests that you come prepared not only with a short-term view on the situation, but a longer-term action plan. ""Be prepared to share specifics around how the money will be used to meet current and future goals, whether it's to overcome a difficult financial situation or fund a big investment,"" he says. ""Prove that you'll be making the most of that family member's support by discussing proactive actions you're taking to improve your financial situation and best position yourself financially going forward."" Note too, Rappaport says, that when a family member who has given help is no longer handling their own affairs, it is probably unreasonable to ask for continued help.",3.0
1456293,Goldman says U.S. economy may be slowly growing into the longest expansion in history,"Since the financial crisis, the economy has never been called robust, but it may be in the longest expansion on record, with a couple more years to go. Goldman Sachs economists said, in a recent note, that their model shows an increased 31 percent chance for a U.S. recession in the next nine quarters. That number is rising. But it's a good news, bad news story, and the good news is there is now a two-thirds chance that the recovery will be the longest on record. ""The likelihood that the expansion will break the prior record is consistent with our long-standing view that the combination of a deep recession and an initially slow recovery has set us up for an unusually long cycle,"" they wrote. The current expansion has already lasted 95 months, now the third-longest in U.S. history in 33 business cycles going back to 1854, the economists said. ""Only the expansions from March 1991 to March 2001 [120 months] and from February 1961 to December 1969 [106 months] were longer,"" they wrote. The Goldman economists also say the medium-term risk of a recession is rising, ""mainly because the economy is at full employment and still growing above trend."" They define a recession as a quarter of negative growth. ""The most obvious way to keep risk from rising much further would be a slowdown of output and employment growth to a trend pace before too long,"" the economists wrote. This would require more Federal Reserve tightening than is currently priced in the bond market, they wrote. April's strong jobs report last Friday provided some comfort that U.S. economic growth isn't flatlining, after a stream of economic data that fell below expectations. U.S. GDP grew at just 0.7 percent in the first quarter, and economists expect second-quarter GDP to be as much as 3 percent or even more. While many economists were encouraged by the 211,000 jobs created last month and 4.4 percent unemployment rate, the Goldman economists, in a separate note, wrote that they see the potential for the labor market to overheat. The economists say their model says ""that recession risk at the 1, 5, and 9-quarter horizon is well explained by lagged GDP growth, the slope of the yield curve, equity price changes, house price changes, the output gap, the private debt/GDP ratio, and economic policy uncertainty.""",4.0
1460690,"Russian swimmers Morozov, Lobintsev 'not cleared for Rio'","RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The confusing case of Vladimir Morozov and Nikita Lobintsev took a new twist on Tuesday when swimming’s ruling body said, despite earlier reports, that the Russian duo had not been cleared to compete at the Olympics and still await a final decision. Earlier, the pair’s lawyer told Russia’s TASS news agency that they had been cleared by FINA after successfully appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against being banned from the Games by swimming’s world governing body. “Contrary to recent media reports, the eligibility of Russian swimmers Vladimir Morozov and Nikita Lobintsev to compete has not been confirmed and will not be confirmed until the IOC’s three-person commission to review Russian entrants renders its final decision on these athletes, along with the other members of the Russian swimming team,” FINA said in a statement. “The two athletes filed an appeal to CAS and FINA understands that this Court has forwarded the case to the IOC three-person commission for final decision.” The two swimmers have never failed a doping test but FINA banned them following the IOC’s ruling that only athletes who can prove they have operated under a bona-fide anti-doping system should be allowed to compete in Rio. Both were mentioned in the McLaren report for the World Anti-Doping Agency in reference to “disappearing positives” - whereby positive dope tests by Russian athletes were destroyed or covered up, leading to FINA ruling them ineligible. Lobintsev and U.S.-based Morozov were part of Russia’s bronze-medal winning 4x100 metres freestyle team at the London 2012 Games, while Lobintsev also won silver in the 4x200 freestyle relay at Beijing 2008.

1467985,How Trump Wins Reelection,"To many political observers over the past year, the prospect of President Donald Trump’s reelection looked doubtful at best. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon reportedly gave Trump a 30 percent chance of finishing his term. Mike Murphy, the longtime GOP consultant and NeverTrumper, said that Trump will only be president “until early 2019.” And JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, like many others, bet more modestly: that Trump would be the first one-term president since George H. W. Bush.  These predictions were understandable. In 2017, it seemed, every day brought another Trump scandal, a bombshell in the Russia story, a brawl in the White House, or a diplomatic crisis, which explains why Trump’s approval rating last year was a historic low for a president’s first year in office. By year’s end, Democrats were anticipating a sweeping victory in this year’s midterm elections, with the opportunity to take back the House and perhaps even the Senate, and an enormous field of candidates was unofficially lining up for the party’s 2020 primary. But recent data should trouble them. Internal polling by the Democratic group Priorities USA showed the president’s approval rating had climbed to 44 percent in early February, which “mirrors Trump’s improving position in public polls.” Gallup finds a narrow majority of Americans support his handling of the economy, and the new Republican tax law is getting more popular.  “I think people just kind of assume he’s a goner,” FiveThirtyEight statistician Nate Silver told me recently, “but look, he’s now more in a range where presidents have recovered to win reelection. His approval rating is up to 41 or 42 percent in our tracking. That verges on being a normal number that resembles what happened to Reagan or Clinton or Obama in their second years.” (Silver noted over the weekend that Trump dipped to 39 percent in their tracking.) As Jim Messina, who managed President Barack Obama’s reelection campaign in 2012, warned earlier this month, “Donald Trump can absolutely be reelected.” Former George W. Bush speechwriter Matt Latimer is even more confident of the president’s chances. “Donald Trump is on track to win reelection,” he argued in Politico Magazine over the weekend. “He’s cut taxes. He’s rolled back regulations. He’s put ISIS on its heels. The economy and the stock market are humming along again, despite recent turmoil.”  No analyst I interviewed would speak as confidently. “Only an an amateur would try to predict the results of a presidential election three years from now,” Roger Stone, the longtime GOP consultant and Trump confidant, told me. But the notion that Trump won’t make it to 2020—whether because he’s impeached, he resigns, or worse—looks increasingly misguided. So does Democrats’ confidence in taking back the White House. “When you think you’re destined to win,” said Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, “you’re halfway to losing.” Some analysts have been saying for almost a year that Trump could be reelected. Last May, Columbia University sociology fellow Musa al-Gharbi wrote for The Conversation that “Trump will most likely be reelected” due to the “default effect” in presidential politics: Most incumbents win a second term. He also downplayed Trump’s unpopularity. “Trump won his first term despite record low approval ratings, triumphing over the marginally less unpopular Hillary Clinton,” he wrote. “He will probably be able to repeat this feat if necessary.” It seemed hard to believe at the time. Then, as now, Trump’s approval rating was in the high 30s, and his presidency was in chaos. He’d just fired former FBI Director James Comey and—the day after al-Gharbi’s piece ran—told NBC News that Comey’s firing was because “this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.” Trump seemed to be in a hurry to get indicted or impeached. But al-Gharbi’s argument is much more believable nine months later. “If you had the election literally today, I think Trump would be an underdog in the popular vote, but I don’t know about the electoral college,” FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver told me. “He’s coming from a low point where he had, approval ratings wise, by far the worst first year of any president. But he’s kind of reverting to some mean, in a way, and the mean is how, on average, incumbent presidents get reelected. You know, on average incumbent presidents are having a rough time two years in and their parties suffer anywhere between mild and humongous loses in the midterms, but the baseline case is that incumbent presidents usually win.” Trump’s most obvious strength heading toward 2020 is the enduring and enthusiastic support of his base. “I would say the most distinctive thing about him other than his obnoxiousness is that his followers aren’t a base,” Sabato said. “They’re a cult. This is a cult. They’ve ceded their independent thinking to this man. This is the most intense cult that I can remember in American politics.” Though their intensity might not be apparent in this fall’s midterm elections, because Trump isn’t on the ballot, they’ll likely show up in massive numbers to support Trump’s reelection in 2020. “If Trump isn’t removed from office and doesn’t lead the country into some form of global catastrophe, he could secure a second term simply by maintaining his current level of support with his political base,” Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik wrote in The Washington Post in October. “Since Trump’s inaugural address, his focus has been on maintaining his support among this loyal base rather than expanding it. As counterintuitive as it may seem, this could be a winning political strategy.” Sosnik argued that Trump can’t win a two-person race with this strategy, but wrote that the president might have another pathway: “The lack of voters’ faith in both parties increases the probability that there will be a major third-party candidate on the 2020 ballot. It will also lead to other minor-party candidates joining the presidential race. The multi-candidate field will further divide the anti-Trump vote, making it possible for him to get reelected simply by holding on to his current level of support.” One prominent Democratic strategist told me Trump is most likely to win if he runs as an independent candidate himself. “I think he’s positioned himself from the beginning to run outside the Republican Party, and frankly I think that’s his best option,” said Tad Devine, who served as Bernie Sanders’s senior strategist in the 2016 presidential primary. (Devine thinks Republicans might distance themselves from Trump after he costs them dearly in the midterms.) “Path number two is that the country moves along for three years and continues to create jobs, and there’s no new war that breaks out, and he wins the Republican nomination without contest, and the Democrats have a long and bitter fight,” he said. Devine isn’t particularly worried about the latter possibility. He calls Trump “the greatest unifier of the Democratic Party,” and said, “I don’t think there will be a problem for Democrats to get behind whoever wins the nominating process.” But not everyone is so sure. “What are the chances you’re going to have that many Democrats fighting among themselves and not have permanent splits, rifts, and divides in the general election?” asked Sabato. “Just look at Hillary and Bernie.” Sabato also noted the third-party factor, telling me, “Inevitably, they’ll take far more votes from a Democratic candidate than Trump.... The more options you have to vote against Trump, the worse it is for the Democratic nominee.” Trump could be hurt, however, by a strong challenge from within the Republican Party. As American University historian Allan Lichtman has argued, “an internal nomination contest” is “the single best predictor of presidential election results.” (Ohio Governor John Kasich reportedly is weighing a Trump challenge in 2020, either as a Republican or independent.) Lichtman, who has correctly called the outcome of every presidential election since 1984 except one (2000), bases his predictions on 13 “keys” including incumbency, scandal, charisma, the economy, foreign policy, social unrest, and third-party candidacies. “If Trump wins reelection,” Lichtman told me, “it will be because he quells a revolt in his own party, establishes more of a conservative agenda than just tax cuts, avoids a big foreign policy disaster, and perhaps even achieves a foreign policy success.” At the moment, he said, Trump is “in a precarious position, but the keys are not so firmly aligned that you can make a clear prediction.” Lichtman said the only variable that Democrats can control in the 2020 election is whether they nominate a charismatic candidate. He noted that the party’s past three presidents—Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and Jimmy Carter—were all elected as “young unknowns,” which does not describe the top likely candidates to run against Trump in 2020: Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders. “The Democratic Party increasingly is looking like a nursing home,” Sabato said. The conventional wisdom says that a strong economy favors the incumbent party in the White House. That didn’t hold true in 2016, but Sean Trende, a senior elections analyst for RealClearPolitics, thinks the economy will play a key role in how low-information voters evaluate Trump. “The people who really care and are apoplectic or think he’s the greatest guy ever are already voting Democratic or Republican,” he said. “What you’re left with as deciders are these people who don’t follow politics really closely but do know if they got a raise this year of if their cousin got laid off.” This kind of analysis could help Trump, assuming the economy continues to improve. Silver described precisely how voters could rationalize reelecting the president in such a scenario: “You know what? I was worried about Trump when he was first in office and I don’t like the tweeting, but the fact is things have worked out okay for me personally, the economy seems to be in as good shape as it’s been in many years, and so why not? Why not give him another four years? Nothing blew up.” Trende told me that “if the election were held tomorrow, Trump would lose,” but warned against overconfidence: “I kind of feel like I’ve seen this movie before.” Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Allan Lichtman has correctly called the outcome of every presidential election since 1984. He predicted that Al Gore would win in 2000. Graham Vyse is a former staff writer at The New Republic.",1.5
1469500,Australia's St George Mining in talks with Chinese battery maker,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - St George Mining Ltd is in talks with a Chinese battery manufacturer that is interested in buying a stake in the Australian nickel producer, Executive Chairman John Prineas said on Wednesday. The interest from the Chinese company, which Prineas declined to identify, underscores the massive appetite for minerals used to make electric vehicle batteries. Nickel is a key ingredient used to make battery cathodes. “We’re big believers in the electric vehicle theme,” Prineas said in an interview on the sidelines of the Mines and Money conference in New York. “There definitely is a push toward more nickel-dominant batteries.” Many of the so-called electric vehicle battery “gigafactories” being built around the world are configured to produce cathodes with a 811 nickel-cobalt-manganese chemistry, which is 80 percent comprised of nickel, rather than other cathode compositions, which use equal parts of all three minerals. That has fueled speculation that nickel will supplant cobalt as a major battery mineral. Cobalt is primarily mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and some extraction techniques - especially using child labor - have made its use deeply unpopular across the battery industry. Prineas cited data from Benchmark Minerals showing that if all of the 70 EV battery gigafactories under construction around the world come online, global nickel demand would spike 19 times. Despite that rising demand, nickel prices have not surged. Prices for the metal are up 14 percent so far this year, but remain 19 percent below year-ago levels. “This rising demand for nickel will be reflected in the price in due course,” Prineas said. Shares of St George have gained about 14 percent so far this year in Sydney trading. Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Cynthia Osterman",2.5
1483868,Lockheed fielding more missile defense queries amid North Korea tests,"Lockheed Martin, the Pentagon's No. 1 weapons supplier, said on Tuesday its customers want to defend themselves against possible incoming missile attacks and are increasingly asking about missile defense systems. The greater interest comes amid a surge of North Korean long-range missile tests, unsettling its neighbors South Korea and Japan, as well as the United States. ""The level of dialogue around missile defense is now at the prime minister and minister of defense level,"" Tim Cahill, the vice president of Lockheed's Air and Missile Defense business, told Reuters in an interview. U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said: ""North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. "" Some countries are putting missile defense at the top of their list of desired capabilities, Cahill said. Interest has increased over the last 12 to 18 months, as have threats, he said. Shares of Lockheed are up nearly 8 percent, to $300.10, since North Korea's first long-range missile test on July 4. The stock is up 20 percent year-to-date. The increased demand could turn into sales over the coming years. The U.S. government sanctions weapons sales in a process that can take years and often requires the approval of U.S. legislators. Lockheed sells security and intelligence products including ships, planes, and missile systems to the U.S. intelligence community, the military and NASA. The U.S. government accounted for about 70 percent of Lockheed's revenue in 2016.

1490128,Chinese state media chuckles at Trump for 'messing up' America,"President Donald Trump received a cheeky editorial from China's state-run press over his decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals order — the so-called ""Dreamers"" program. The editorial, run in the People's Daily on Thursday, was titled: ""Chinese chuckle at Trump for messing up picture-perfect America."" The People's Daily editorial noted ""strong and mixed"" reactions on Chinese social media such as microblog Weibo. ""In the eyes of some Chinese, Trump has made a big mess in America, and the decision to kill the program is just further evidence that the American Dream is quickly becoming the American Pipe Dream,"" the Communist Party's official newspaper said. The program allowed children of immigrants who came to the country illegally a two-year period of protection from deportation and to work in the United States. Business leaders in the U.S. and members of Congress criticized the move to overturn the directive, which was ordered by President Barack Obama. Trump has challenged Congress to enact a replacement. Some Chinese support Trump's move, the editorial noted. ""Meanwhile, some Chinese are just enjoying the political thriller.

1490208,China looks at ending sales of gasoline cars,"China is joining France and Britain in announcing plans to end sales of gasoline and diesel cars. China's industry ministry is developing a timetable to end production and sale of traditional fuel cars and will promote development of electric technology, state media on Sunday cited a Cabinet official as saying. The reports gave no possible target date, but Beijing is stepping up pressure on automakers to accelerate development of electrics. China is the biggest auto market by number of vehicles sold, giving any policy changes outsize importance for the global industry. A deputy industry minister, Xin Guobin, said at an auto industry forum on Saturday his ministry has begun ""research on formulating a timetable to stop production and sales of traditional energy vehicles,"" according to the Xinhua News Agency and the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily. France and Britain announced in July they will stop sales of gasoline and diesel automobiles by 2040 as part of efforts to reduce pollution and carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. Communist leaders also want to curb China's growing appetite for imported oil and see electric cars as a promising industry in which their country can take an early lead. China passed the United States last year as the biggest electric car market. Sales of electrics and gasoline-electric hybrids rose 50 percent over 2015 to 336,000 vehicles, or 40 percent of global demand. U.S. sales totaled 159,620. The reports of Xin's comments in the eastern city of Tianjin gave no other details about electric car policy but cited him as saying Beijing plans to ""elevate new energy vehicles to a new strategic level."" Beijing has supported electric development with billions of dollars in research subsidies and incentives to buyers, but is switching to a quota system that will shift the financial burden to automakers. Under the proposed quotas, electric and hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles would have to make up 8 percent of each automaker's output next year, 10 percent in 2019 and 12 percent in 2020. Automakers that fail to meet their target could buy credits from competitors that have a surplus. Beijing has ordered state-owned Chinese power companies to speed up installation of charging stations to increase the appeal of electrics. Chinese automaker BYD Auto, a unit of battery maker BYD Ltd., is the world's biggest electric vehicle maker by number of units sold. It sells gasoline-electric hybrid sedans and SUVs in China and markets all-electric taxis and buses in the United States, Europe and Latin America as well as in China. Volvo Cars, owned by China's Geely Holding Group, announced plans this year to make electric cars in China for global sale starting in 2019. General Motors Co., Volkswagen AG and Nissan Motor Co. and others have announced they are launching or looking at joint ventures with Chinese partners to develop and manufacture electric vehicles in China.",4.0
1492430,Amazon makes Whole Foods' prices more competitive with rivals in LA: JPMorgan,"Amazon's price slashing has made Whole Foods' prices more competitive with, and in some cases cheaper than, rivals Ralphs and Sprouts in the greater Los Angeles area, according to JPMorgan analysts. Amazon wasted no time trying to scrub Whole Foods of its ""Whole Paycheck"" image. On its first day officially owning Whole Foods, Amazon cut prices on a number of items across the store. JPMorgan's Ken Goldman and Thomas Palmer recently visited Whole Foods, Ralphs — which is a Kroger property — and Sprouts stores in the greater Los Angeles area to check prices and speak to store managers and employees about any changes being made. The LA market is the single largest one for all three retailers, Goldman and Palmer said in a note to investors Monday. At each store, they compared prices on a number of natural and organic foods, as well as items Amazon advertised it had lowered prices on. For products on JPMorgan's natural-and-organics-focused shopping list, Ralphs is now 4 percent less expensive than Whole Foods, and Sprouts is now 5 percent less expensive, Goldman and Palmer wrote. Ralphs and Sprouts were about 11 percent less expensive on average than Whole Foods before Amazon acquired it. The change was even more pronounced on items Amazon advertised it had cut prices on. For those products, Ralphs is now 4 percent more expensive than Whole Foods; it used to be 20 percent less expensive. Sprouts is now 1.3 percent more expensive than Whole Foods; it used to be 24 percent less expensive. However, the items Goldman and Palmer compared were heavily focused on natural and organic foods, they noted. Before Whole Foods' price cuts, JPMorgan found their conventional products were 20 percent more expensive than those at Kroger and Sprouts. Sprouts has said it's always committed to being competitively priced. Ralphs, meantime, offers customers an entire ""savings center"" for shoppers on its website. Goldman and Palmer wrote they did not notice promotional or merchandising changes at the Ralphs and Sprouts stores they visited. ""We would expect that over time, Whole Foods' competitors will likely have to lower prices on certain items, especially in produce; otherwise they will see their traffic under pressure,"" Goldman said in an email. JPMorgan's findings suggest Amazon's price cuts are having an effect at Whole Foods. News coverage of the changes buoyed their effectiveness, Goldman and Palmer wrote. From their store visits, it does not appear Amazon has made many more cuts since the initial ones that were advertised on its first day officially owning Whole Foods. That did not surprise them. ""Additional price cuts so soon after the first wave — and without accompanying press releases — would probably not have as much effect on customer traffic and purchase habits (which are the main purpose for price reductions),"" Goldman and Palmer wrote. They ""don't really know"" when Amazon will cut prices again, Goldman said in an email. Amazon will likely want to do some diagnostics and testing first, he said, although the information isn't clear. Amazon has promised ""more to come"" in partnering with Whole Foods, adding that Prime members will eventually see integration with their loyalty program in stores. For now, Whole Foods has mainly marked down produce and items from its cost-conscious, private-label brand 365. Whole Foods is also in the midst of rolling out 365-branded stores across the United States, which will give Amazon an expanded real estate footprint but on a smaller scale. Whole Foods declined to comment. Wall Street has hammered grocery stocks since Amazon announced in June it would acquire Whole Foods, wiping out billions in market value from grocery retailers. Kroger's shares have fallen 12.7 percent since the day before the announcement. Sprouts' stock price has tumbled 16.3 percent in the same time period. Correction: For products on JPMorgan's natural-and-organics-focused shopping list, Sprouts is now 5 percent less expensive than Whole Foods. For items where Amazon advertised it had cut prices, Sprouts is now 1.3 percent more expensive than Whole Foods.",4.0

1500654,Infostellar taps into space boom with Airbnb service for satellites,"TOKYO —The small satellite revolution sparked by Elon Musk and others has created a need for more viable options for sending massive amounts of data back to Earth. An industry now estimated at $260.5 billion, this niche satellite market is set for more rapid growth as SpaceX, Boeing and Oneweb all plan huge constellations. Thousands of cube- and microsatellite launches are also scheduled over the next six years. Recognizing the trend, a Japanese start-up called Infostellar has plans to disrupt the status quo. Infostellar is an Airbnb for satellite antennas. It has a platform that enables antenna-sharing among satellite operators to improve communication for satellites and spacecraft. The idea is to monetize unused inventory when it's lying idle. That is key, since a single antenna only has short conversation windows with a non-geostationary — low-Earth-orbit — satellite per day. Overcoming the high costs and limited access times associated with ground antenna has such great potential that Japan's Infostellar raised $7.3 million in Series A funding led by Airbus Ventures in September. Other investors included WERU Investment, D4V, Sony Innovation Fund and existing investors FreakOut Holdings and 500 Startups Japan. According to Infostellar co-founder and CEO Naomi Kurahara, the Infostellar service is currently in pre-launch, but a limited beta with a handful of selected partners will open in October. The goal is to make it widely available in 2018. Kurahara, a satellite ground systems engineer and graduate of France's International Space University, predicts that by 2020, 5,000 satellites from a variety of companies will be in operation. There are currently estimated to be 1,459. Saying she targets contracts with 30 percent to 40 percent of these operators, the CEO expects annual revenue will soar: ""We hope to get $200 million to $500 million."" Kurahara expects to reduce the cost of satellite communication time by 90 percent. According to the CEO, ground-station access typically costs $500 for 10 minutes. Infostellar's cloud-based Stellarstation system will connect operators to antenna around the world. The platform will also enable member ground stations to use other locations in the network. The idea is new for the sector, where satellite ground stations are often owned and maintained by a single operator tasked with tracking a spacecraft for a short time each day. ""Each station requires regulatory approval in that respective country. Someone would have to host that antenna, someone would have to maintain it, provide the infrastructure, supply it power, supply it connectivity, so that can be expensive,"" explained David Luber, an expert in satellite spectrum management with Aerospace Corp. Kurahara said expanding the network is a priority and things are starting to move fast. Atlanta-based Spaceworks, an aerospace concept design and systems analysis firm, forecasts nearly 2,400 nano- and microsatellites will be launched up to 2023. All of which will need infrastructure and systems to communicate with Earth. The firm's Nano/Microsatellite Market Forecast 2017 predicts Earth observation and remote-sensing craft will make up 63 percent of those launches until 2019. These figures are good news for Infostellar, as satellite constellation operators are the company's main targets. ""The more satellites you have up there, the more data you gather, the more you are going to need information and data management,"" said Phil Smith, senior space analyst with Alexandria, Virginia-based Bryce Space and Technology. ""The ground component of that is really critical to keep track, to monitor and to gather data from these satellites in an efficient manner."" CEO Kurahara provided some context: ""If I have one antenna in Japan, I only get about 30 minutes communication time per day for one satellite."" She continued, ""And the rest of the time, it is not working. ""That's why satellite operators are looking for antennas in different places."" Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Infostellar predicts 5,000 satellites from various companies will be in operation by 2020. — By Julian Littler, special to CNBC.com",4.0

Here’s what it means,"One of the best-performing tech stocks this year is testing a critical level, and it could be a make or break moment for the stock's incredible run, according to one technician. Alibaba share prices have more than doubled this year, but Matt Maley of Miller Tabak warns the stock looks vulnerable heading into earnings on Thursday. ""The stock has had a great run. It's made a series of higher highs and higher lows, which is always very good. It has stayed above its 50-day moving average all year long. However in the last few weeks, it has kind of leveled off,"" Maley said Friday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch."" He noted that the stock traded below its 50-day moving average on Thursday morning for the first time since January. ""Right now after such a big run, I'm kind of middle of the road, and the next couple of weeks are going to be very key, whichever way it breaks,"" he said. ""It will either rally further or it rolls back over. It's going to be very key over the next few weeks."" Stacey Gilbert noted there might be better opportunities than being long Alibaba outright. ""The market seems to be divided here. They do see a lot of volatility heading into [earnings],"" said the head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna. Gilbert noted that the implied move on earnings on Thursday is 5 to 6 percent, nearly double the last few quarters. ""So there is extra risk being priced into the quarter here, … and options aren't cheap."" She offered Altaba, the part of Yahoo that didn't go with its internet business after Verizon's takeover in June, as an alternative. ""We think that [Altaba] is an interesting alternative, given its 15 percent stake in Alibaba and given that 71 percent of its value is coming from Alibaba,"" she said Friday on ""Power Lunch."" ""[It is also] trading at a discount on a relative value basis, so that's an area we think is a more interesting alternative for those that aren't in BABA."" The stock has surged 77 percent this year so far. Analysts polled by FactSet are expecting Alibaba to report earnings of $1.04 per share on $7.8 billion in revenue for the third quarter.",4.0

Alaska Gasline Development, the State of Alaska, Sinopec, China Investment Corp and the Bank of China have signed an agreement to advance LNG in Alaska, the U.S. government said in an email. The agreement will involve investment of up to $43 billion, create up to 12,000 U.S. jobs during construction, reduce the trade deficit between the United States and Asia by $10 billion a year, and give China clean energy, it said. There were no other details. AGDC is building a gas treatment plant, an 800-mile (1,287 km) pipeline to south central Alaska for in-state use, and a liquefaction plant in Nikiski to produce up to 20 million tons of LNG per year for export. China, the world's third-largest gas buyer, is importing more LNG as the government tries to wean the country off dirty coal as part of its push to clear the skies, while the United States wants to sell more of its excess gas abroad.",4.5

The big year he's focused on is 2019. ""We believe by then, that a good number of autonomous services will be available in a number of cities,"" said Behr. ""2028 is really the year a large number of people probably have the transportation budgets going to a mobility service.""Behr's vision has fueled his company Stratim to be the platform tracking, monitoring and overseeing the maintenance of more than 10,000 vehicles operated by more than 50 mobility services.San Francisco-based Stratim, which has raised more than $36 million through two rounds of funding, is a peek into the growing world of companies targeting the burgeoning car-sharing and ride-hailing markets.General Motors' Maven car-share program is one service using Stratim. ""They use our system to not only monitor their vehicles, but also to get those vehicles repaired so they can go back into usage,"" said Behr.In short, Stratim is the coordinator of when vehicles in ride-hailing fleets need to be gassed up (or recharged), cleaned, or have maintenance performed. It not only alerts the owners of the vehicles it also plans when and where services of vehicles take place. With Alphabet's Waymo making plans to roll out self-driving minivans to give paying customers rides and GM planning to announce its strategy for autonomous-drive vehicles, it's clear driverless cars and trucks will soon become a part of everyday traffic. This is why firms like Stratim are building out the support network for thousands of vehicles expected to be driving without a human behind the steering wheel. Right now, Stratim is overseeing vehicles in just 20 cities, but as automakers and tech firms expand their fleets and add more self-driving vehicles, Behr expects his company is well positioned to not only know cars need something, but to also make it happen quickly. ""Every minute that a car can't be used by one of these mobility services is a minute of downtime and a minute of lost money,"" he said.",3.0
1507325,Comcast tops profit forecasts as broadband business grows,"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) beat Wall Street profit and revenue estimates on Wednesday as its high-speed internet business grew and it lost fewer cable subscribers than expected. Comcast’s fourth quarter showed that fears over “cord cutting” in cable services and slower broadband growth may be overstated, analysts said. The results also reinforced why Comcast’s NBCUniversal news and entertainment arm has announced a streaming strategy that appears less disruptive to traditional television and movie businesses than services planned by AT&T Inc (T.N) and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N). “We’ve always thought that the television ecosystem was healthier than maybe some people thought,” NBCUniversal Chief Executive Stephen Burke told analysts in a conference call. Shares in the top U.S. cable services provider were up nearly 4 percent in midday trading. Comcast also said it would raise its dividend by 10 percent to 84 cents per share. NBCUniversal in January announced an advertising-supported streaming TV service that will launch in 2020. Unlike Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), which charges a monthly fee and is seen as a threat to traditional pay television, NBC’s streaming service will be free for its pay-TV customers. It will initially be available to about 50 million customers and expand as NBC negotiates with other pay-TV providers. Comcast said it lost 29,000 video customers in the quarter, less than the 33,000 it lost last year and the 62,000 estimated by analysts, according to research firm FactSet. Revenue slipped 1.6 percent to $5.58 billion. Revenue from Comcast’s high-speed internet business climbed 10 percent to $4.4 billion as the company added 351,000 net subscribers, up from 350,000 a year earlier. Still, the net subscriber additions fell short of the average analyst estimate of 356,000. “Forgive us for wondering aloud why the market thinks cable is somehow a doomed business,” analyst Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson, said in a report after the results. “It’s hard to imagine a better testimony to the strength and resilience of the cable model.” On the media side, business was also growing. NBCUniversal reported a 7.1 percent rise in revenue to $9.40 billion. Filmed entertainment revenue rose 14 percent, boosted by movies including “The Grinch”, while theme park revenue increased 3.6 percent to $1.51 billion. Revenue from broadcast television rose nearly 4 percent $3.10 billion. Comcast, which beat Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) in an auction for Sky, said revenue reported from the British pay-TV group was $4.59 billion. On an adjusted basis, revenue was $5.02 billion. Overall, Comcast revenue jumped 26 percent to $27.85 billion in the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, revenue was $28.28 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $27.55 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding items, the company earned 64 cents per share, above the average estimate of 62 cents per share. Net income attributable to the company fell to $2.51 billion, or 55 cents per share, from $15.00 billion, or $3.17 per share, a year earlier, when it recorded a $12.7 billion one-time benefit from the U.S. tax overhaul.

1509367,Calvin Harris takes to social media to criticize Taylor Swift,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - DJ and producer Calvin Harris criticized his former girlfriend, pop star Taylor Swift, on social media on Wednesday, for making him “look bad” after a celebrity news publication revealed that Swift had written Harris’ latest hit song under a pseudonym. People magazine, citing Swift’s representative, said Swift had written “This is What You Came For,” which Harris released as a collaboration with R&B singer Rihanna in April. The magazine reported that Swift had written the song under the pseudonym ‘Nils Sjoberg’ while the couple were dating, and that Swift became upset over an interview in which Harris said he did not think he would work with her in the future. Representatives for Swift did not respond to Reuters for comment. “Hurtful to me at this point that her and her team would go so far out of their way to try and make ME look bad at this stage though,” Harris said, in a series of tweets directed at Swift. Harris praised Swift’s lyric-writing talents and said she had wanted to keep their collaboration secret. Swift, 26, and Harris, 32, split up last month after dating for more than a year. Swift, who was named 2016’s highest-earning celebrity by Forbes magazine this week, has recently been photographed with British actor Tom Hiddleston. Harris also hinted at a long-speculated feud between Swift and pop star Katy Perry, saying “I know you’re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I’m not that guy, sorry. I won’t allow it.” Representatives for Perry did not respond for comment. Reporting by Piya Sinha-Roy; Editing by Bill Rigby",3.0
1510380,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Investors cash in on profitable month of May ends, sterling slides","LONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - Stocks flatlined on Wednesday as investors used the last day of May to protect gains built up in what has been yet another lucrative month, while sterling fell after an opinion poll suggested the ruling Conservatives could lose seats in next week’s UK general election. World stocks are poised to end May up nearly 2 percent, marking the seventh straight monthly increase and the longest monthly winning streak in over a decade. MSCI’s global equity index held steady on Wednesday, while European stocks edged down 0.1 percent in early trade following Wall Street’s dip on Tuesday . Asian shares drew some support from data that showed activity in China’s manufacturing sector grew at the same pace in May as in April, although a sturdy performance from the Japanese yen helped push the Nikkei into the red. The biggest mover in currencies was sterling, which shed 0.3 percent after a YouGov poll showed the ruling Conservative Party might lose 20 of the 330 seats it holds while the opposition Labour Party could gain nearly 30 seats. “The return of U.S. and UK markets yesterday (after holidays) saw a little bit of weakness creep in as we head into month end and what has been a positive month for markets, with records broken on an almost daily basis,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets. “This soft tone looks set to be carried over this morning,” he said. The main pan-European indexes were slightly lower early on Wednesday, Germany’s DAX was flat and sterling’s weakness helped lift Britain’s FTSE 100 by 0.2 percent. U.S. futures pointed to a rise of 0.1 percent on Wall Street . Activity in China’s manufacturing sector grew at the same pace in May as in April, with a headline reading of 51.2, official data showed, in a reassuring sign the world’s second-biggest economy is not losing too much steam after a solid first quarter performance. Analysts had seen a slight slowing to 51.0. European markets could take their cue later in the day from euro zone inflation data, which are expected to show a sharp slowdown to 1.5 percent in May from 1.9 percent April. If confirmed, the European Central Bank may be less inclined to signal the start of the process of withdrawing its huge policy stimulus at its meeting next week, analysts said. The euro was holding steady just under $1.12, while 10-year German bond yields were up a basis point at 0.305 percent. The dollar was steady against the yen at 110.85 yen, and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was up a basis point at 2.227 percent. Two weeks ago it was at 2.41 percent. Sterling fell as low as $1.2791, near a one-month low of $1.2775 touched on Friday before recovering some ground to $1.2810. It also slipped to 0.8738 pound per euro , near Friday’s eight-week low of 0.8750. New constituency-by-constituency modelling by YouGov showed the ruling Conservative Party might lose 20 seats at the June 8 election while Labour could gain nearly 30 seats, potentially leading to a hung parliament, The Times said. The news came after a string of opinion polls showed a narrowing lead for prime minister Theresa May’s Conservatives, shaking investors’ confidence that she would easily win a majority and strengthen her hand in the Brexit negotiations. “We’re getting very negative on sterling again,” said George Saravelos, FX strategist at Deutsche Bank. “If May is unable to deliver a substantially increased majority, her ﬂexibility to negotiate will not have improved. A strong Conservative majority is also only a necessary, not sufficient condition for a smooth Brexit,” he said. In commodities, oil prices remained soft, as concerns lingered about whether the extension of output cuts by OPEC and other producing countries will be enough to support prices. U.S. crude futures fell 0.9 percent to $49.21 a barrel. Global benchmark Brent was down 0.8 percent at $51.44 per barrel. Gold was flat at $1,263 an ounce.

1510510,The new retirement: Working,"For some soon-to-be retirees, retirement will look a lot like their 9-to-5 life. Nearly 3 out of 4 Americans plan to work beyond traditional retirement age on at least a part-time basis, according to a recent Gallup poll. A separate AARP study found that 37 percent of working Americans ages 50 to 64 said they intend to work after retiring from their current careers. Of those, 44 percent plan to enter new fields. Of course, working in ""retirement"" has many financial benefits. Aside from the income, it can allow you to preserve your retirement savings for later in life and even keep building those assets in tax-advantaged retirement plans. (Contributions to traditional IRAs can only continue up to the year in which you turn 70½, but if you earn income past that point, you may be able to continue making contributions to a Roth IRA indefinitely.) But that extra income can also come at a cost if you're not careful, according to Marcy Keckler, a vice president of financial advice strategy at Ameriprise Financial. For ambitious retirees, here's are three things to watch out for: If you haven't yet reached full retirement age (66 or older) and already collect benefits, the wages you earn through continued work could result in reduced Social Security payments. Those who haven't already claimed Social Security may want to delay those benefits to earn a higher amount later down the road. If you are taking income from retirement accounts or generating earnings from your savings or investments and earning income from a new job, that could move you into a higher marginal tax bracket, meaning those distributions and investment earnings would be taxed at a higher rate — so be prepared. Talk to your employer about whether you should sign up for Medicare Part B (a monthly premium applies). If you delay enrollment in Part B, you may be subject to a 10 percent annual penalty. However, if you are receiving health-care coverage through an employer, you may be eligible to get this penalty waived. Just check the rules carefully before you turn 65. How you counter these potential hits could be the key to your retirement, if you ever do decide to stop working.",3.5
1512192,Trump advisers see arbitration as way to speed infrastructure plans,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group advising U.S. President Donald Trump on infrastructure has proposed an arbitration-style pilot program to slash the current 10 years it often takes to break ground on projects, without short-changing environmental standards. The group, led by billionaire New York real estate developers Richard LeFrak and Steve Roth, made the suggestion to Trump and others in the White House last week, LeFrak told Reuters on Monday. Builders, unions and others often rue a permitting processes that can last a decade or more – a potential snag in Trump’s plan to launch a 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure building program to create jobs and bolster the world’s biggest economy. LeFrak said the advisory council is looking at a pilot program comparable to the arbitration process used in bankruptcy court to speed up proposals, reduce red tape and halt litigation that can tie up infrastructure projects in court for years. “Somebody in authority would make the decisions, all the mitigation that should be coming out of it, whether it’s environmental mitigation, other mitigation, gets decided at that moment and that’s it,” he said. “It’s just a proposal. We’re asking them to try it.” The council is not empowered to pick projects or make decisions about how to streamline the project permitting process for projects, he said. Any pilot program would be up to state and federal officials and Congress, he said. LeFrak added that the proposal would not allow projects for bridges, roads or airports to side-step regulations, such as environmental rules. The idea would be to hammer out differences and objections faster in an arbitration-like setting so that projects could get underway in less time. Australia, Canada and Germany typically take two years to approve infrastructure projects compared with 10 years in the United States, he said. A shortened review process could leave projects open to worries from environmentalists and others that an expedited permitting system could short-change environmental protections. Environmental groups are skeptical of Trump’s promise to overhaul government regulations without jeopardizing America’s water and air quality. When Trump unveils his budget on Thursday, he is expected to slash the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency by 25 percent. The Sierra Club, Nature Conservancy and other environmental groups as well as the office of House of Representatives Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi were not available for comment. Permitting and other regulatory hurdles can delay projects for years, a potential liability for a program that seeks to put money – and people – to work immediately. “There’s got to be some way without abrogating anybody’s rights to get all this on the table much more quickly,” said LeFrak, who is chairman and chief executive of the LeFrak Organization, a leading developer and property owner in the New York metro area and South Florida. LeFrak pointed to the replacement within 14 months of a bridge that collapsed in Minneapolis in 2007 killing 13 people as an example of how projects can get done without compromising standards. LeFrak also said the committee wants to use private funds to soak up cost overruns and keep projects maintained after completion. He suggested, as well, one possible solution to the key question of how to pay for Trump’s infrastructure program: a higher federal gas tax. If not, funding will have to come from general tax revenue, he said. Local and state government pay for about 70 percent of infrastructure projects in the United States, with the remainder funded by the federal government. The American Society of Civil Engineers last week recommended an 18.4 cents per gallon federal tax on gasoline be raised at least to 25 cents per gallon to fill a funding deficit for infrastructure it said was $2 trillion. “I’m saying somebody’s going to have pay for it. It doesn’t come for free,” LeFrak said. “I wish I was powerful enough to impose a gas tax, but I’m not.”",3.5
1513651,"US private sector added 250,000 jobs in Dec, vs estimate of 190,000: ADP","Private sector job creation surged in December as a strong holiday shopping season pushed companies to hire more workers, ADP and Moody's Analytics said Thursday. The report helped send the Dow to break the 25,000 mark for the first time. Companies hired 250,000 new workers to close out the year, well above Wall Street expectations of 190,000. The month was the best for job creation since March and topped the 185,000 in November, a number that was revised lower by 5,000. The total brought 2017's private payroll growth as gauged by ADP and Moody's to 2.54 million, an average of 212,000 a month. Job growth was broad based, as professional and business services led the way with 72,000 new positions. The education and health services sector was next at 50,000 and trade, transportation and utilities contributed 45,000. Wall Street-related payrolls grew by 19,000. The information services sector was the only one to lose jobs, reporting a drop of 4,000. By size, businesses with between 50 and 499 employees added 100,000 jobs while small firms hired 94,000 and large companies contributed 56,000 to the total. ""The job market ended the year strongly,"" Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi said in a statement. ""Robust Christmas sales prompted retailers and delivery services to add to their payrolls. The tight labor market will get even tighter, raising the specter that it will overheat."" Overall, service-related companies were responsible for the balance of jobs, with 222,000 new hires. Goods-producing industries added the rest, with construction growing by 16,000 and manufacturing by 9,000. The private payrolls numbers come a day ahead of the government's closely watched nonfarm payrolls report. Economists expect that the U.S. economy added about 189,000 jobs in December while the unemployment rate likely stayed at 4.1 percent, according to FactSet. Economists and policymakers at the Federal Reserve will be watching the wages component most closely. Despite a job market that appears at full employment, salaries have been slow to rise. Average hourly earnings are projected to rise 0.3 percent for the month.",4.5
1513861,Self-made millionaire Grant Cardone: 2 things to spend on in 2018,"Do you want to get super rich in 2018? If you're like me, you know that you're capable of doing unbelievable things this year. I believe that you can do it. But you'll need money, and lots of it, to reach your full potential. Once you have some of that money, what steps should you take? Should you put, say, $5,000 in stocks, or in cryptocurrency? I get questions like this all the time. There are the two things I tell people: People don't create wealth because they never invest enough in a deal to get a big payoff. Significant wealth creators make big plays, not little ones. If you have a little bit of money, the only big play that you can make is to invest in yourself. Spend your money on developing new skills, gaining knowledge, and making powerful connections. You can never lose when you invest in yourself. What skills can you learn that will increase your ability to collect money from others? When I was 25, I spent my last $3,000 on an audio program and I can honestly say the investment and commitment to go ""all in"" are the reasons for my success today. Before that, I was addicted to drugs and obsessed with all the wrong things. One single investment changed the whole course of my life. Do you see how powerful investing in yourself can be? The sad truth is that most people don't take it seriously. Maybe you have a friend that talks about riches and glory but won't spend a few thousand dollars to learn a skill or make a connection that can make their dreams come true. How does that make sense? Those kinds of folks, if they do anything at all, look for opportunities to get rich quick without thinking of how to create wealth that can never be destroyed. Don't let that be you. Spend money on yourself so that you can get your income to massive levels. Once your income is up, you'll be ready to start making investments in income-producing assets. Take your money and use it to become better. Add skills and your value will increase in the marketplace. After you spend money on gaining new skills, your income will skyrocket. You should put that money away in sacred accounts to prepare for future investments. So, which investments? When it comes to investing, I'm a coward. Losing money terrifies me. One of my goals is to create indestructible wealth so, if anything ever happened to me, my family would never have to worry about the future. When I spend money, I think in terms of my long-term goals and legacy. That's why I don't risk losing my money. I only spend money on a sure thing — and real estate has been proven for many years to be the preferred investment of the 1 percent. Why? It produces income. If you make the right investment real estate has proven it's a solid bet. Keep in mind, I don't invest in single-family homes. I go after monster deals that produce income. Just like I mentioned earlier, the same principle applies: Go after a big play. That means putting all your money in a great deal. Most people don't go after a big enough deal for it to be worth it. They try to play it safe and small. That's not going to get you the results that you want. Whether you choose to invest in real estate or something else, look for income producing assets. That means cash flow. It's said that ""cash is king"" for a reason. When you're new to investing, I think you're ready to invest once you have saved up $100,000.

1516925,"Tammy Duckworth, Iraq vet, calls Trump 'cadet bone spurs'","Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., hit back at President Donald Trump after he claimed Democrats were hurting the U.S. military by causing a government shutdown. Duckworth, in a speech on Saturday, called Trump a ""five deferment draft-dodger"" and ""Cadet Bone Spurs"" — a reference to the medical diagnosis the president received in 1968 that allowed him to be exempted from military service. The Vietnam War was raging in that year, and the draft was ongoing. Trump went to military high school but never served in the military. ""I will not be lectured about what our military needs by a five deferment draft-dodger. And I have a message for Cadet Bone Spurs: If you cared about our military, you'd stop baiting Kim Jong Un into a war that could put 85,000 American troops and millions of innocent civilians in danger, "" Duckworth said. The Senator for Illinois is a retired Army lieutenant colonel and Black Hawk pilot. She lost both legs after her helicopter was shot down by insurgents near Taji, Iraq, in 2004. The U.S. military does not cease operating during the government shutdown, because it's considered an essential government service. Still, Trump said on Twitter that Democrats were ""holding our Military hostage"" by not supporting a funding bill. The U.S. government shutdown will go into a third day on Monday. Non-essential services such as tourist sites and national parks are closed. But those dealing with public safety and national security continue working. This isn't the first time Duckworth has called Trump ""Cadet Bone Spurs"" — she used the name in a Twitter post earlier in January.",5.0

1531236,Nearly 60% of Americans are streaming and most with Netflix: CNBC survey,"The CNBC All-American Economic Survey finds the nation living the American stream. The poll of 801 Americans around the country shows that 57 percent of the public has some form of streaming service, compared with 43 percent who do not. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percent. The data confirm the rapid adoption of streaming service by American households, which has propelled the value of Netflix to $124 billion from $63 billion just a year ago. It also underscores the pressure traditional media and cable providers are under from the competition. (Comcast, a cable provider and owner of NBC/Universal, is the parent company of CNBC.) Indeed, Netflix dominates the streaming world, with 51 percent of American streamers subscribing to the Los Gatos, Calif.-based video giant. A third of the country subscribes to Amazon Prime and 14 percent say they subscribe to Hulu, making Netflix's total greater than the combined percentage of Amazon and Hulu. Roughly a quarter of the nation has two or more services. Thirty-six percent report having both a streaming service and cable or satellite, while 30 percent say they have just cable or satellite. The so-called cord cutters, that is, those with just streaming service total 20 percent of the nation with 12 percent saying they have neither. (Two percent don't know.) When it comes to viewing habits, there's a virtual tug of war between the competing media. Thirty-six percent of the public reports watching cable more than their streaming service, and 31 percent say they watch streaming more than the cable, with 29 percent saying it's about the same. Americans age 18-34 are among the most dedicated streamers, with 48 percent saying they watch it more than cable, including 32 percent who say they watch it much more than cable. Forty-nine percent of Americans aged 50 to 64 say they stream less than cable, including 30 percent who say much less. But streaming services have made inroads with blue collar workers and modest income Americans as well. And, the data also show that the wealthiest Americans and many in the prime television demographic have both streaming and cable or satellite.",2.5
1532284,"US weekly jobless claims total 242,000, vs 225,000 claims expected","New applications for U.S. unemployment benefits increased more than expected last week, but the number of Americans on jobless rolls fell to its lowest level since 1973, pointing to tightening labor market conditions. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 24,000 to a seasonally adjusted 242,000 for the week ended March 31, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week were revised to show 3,000 more claims received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 225,000 in the latest week. Last week's increase likely reflected difficulties adjusting the data around moving holidays like Easter and school spring breaks. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment. The jobless rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, not too far from the Federal Reserve's forecast of 3.8 percent by the end of this year. The Labor Department said claims for Maine and Colorado were estimated last week. It also said claims-taking procedures in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands had still not returned to normal after the territories were devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria last year. The four-week moving average of initial claims, viewed as a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,000 to 228,250 last week. The claims data has no bearing on March's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 193,000 jobs in March. The unemployment rate is forecast falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.0 percent. Economists are optimistic that tightening labor market conditions will start boosting wage growth in the second half of this year. That should help to support consumer spending, which slowed at the start of the year. The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 64,000 to 1.81 million in the week ended March 24, the lowest level since December 1973. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims dropped 13,500 to 1.85 million, the lowest reading since January 1974.",2.5

1539510,Activist investor ValueAct gives all-clear signal on banks with $1.2 billion Citi stake,"Big U.S. banks have lower risk and greater structural advantages than at any time in decades, ValueAct Capital Partners wrote in an investor letter explaining why it took a $1.2 billion stake in Citigroup this year. ValueAct, led by co-founder Jeffrey Ubben, said Monday that the financial industry is poised for a rebound like other formerly out-of-vogue sectors such as software firms after the dot-com crash and pharmaceutical companies on the eve of patent expirations, according to a quarterly letter obtained by CNBC. The activist firm also owns stakes in Morgan Stanley and KKR. ""The U.S. banking system now has a structurally lower risk profile than any time in our investing lifetimes'' thanks to lower leverage and higher-quality assets held by the industry after the financial crisis, ValueAct said. ""Banks are now primarily engaged in the simple functions that are the lifeblood of our economic system: safeguarding assets, providing access to deposited cash on demand, lending money, processing payments and accessing capital markets on behalf of clients.'' While bank stocks have rebounded sharply in the past five years as memories of the financial crisis fade, not all companies have kept up. Citigroup, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has lagged the shares of J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America. Citi CEO Michael Corbat has led turnaround efforts, including exiting overseas markets and shedding $800 billion in assets, but that work has been underappreciated, ValueAct said. ""We have been having constructive conversations with ValueAct and welcome them as investors,'' Mark Costiglio, a spokesman for New York-based Citigroup, said in a statement sent to CNBC. The bank should take more actions, including replacing Chairman Michael O'Neill and selling its Mexican operations by year-end, Mike Mayo, a bank analyst at Wells Fargo, said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Halftime Report. "" Those types of changes will help the firm boost its market value, which trades below the estimated value of the businesses within the firm, Mayo said. ""People are frustrated, aggravated, this is a stock that's still well below its pre-crisis heights,'' Mayo said. ""You now have an activist in Citigroup stock. They said it wasn't possible; it's been done.'' ValueAct said its thesis on financial stocks was developed when it was evaluating a $1.1 billion investment in Morgan Stanley, which it disclosed in August 2016. That investment reaped returns for ValueAct as investors began to recognize the moves that CEO James Gorman had made to focus on wealth management and improve fixed income trading operations. Since August 2016, Morgan Stanley shares have more than doubled. ValueAct currently owns 1 percent, according to FactSet. ValueAct's stakes in financials, including a holding in credit card services company Alliance Data, now total more than a third of its $13 billion in assets. It took on a stake in KKR in July 2017, and the shares have risen 18 percent since then. ValueAct currently has a 10.2 percent stake, according to FactSet. It also has a 10.6 percent stake in Alliance Data, which it began acquiring in April 2016. Shares of that company are down 6 percent since then. While previous eras were defined by acquiring competitors to become financial supermarkets or wagering capital in trading markets, the industry is now in a different period, ValueAct said. Banks are now in an era where the winners will invest heavily in technology to deepen relationships with customers, focus on core activities in leading businesses and focus on the well-telegraphed return of capital to investors, the firm said. That favors the biggest institutions that have the scale needed to spend billions of dollars on technology. That was part of its rationale for investing in Citigroup, which ValueAct says has leading positions in low-risk businesses that serve global corporations like cash management, payments and receivables processing, and payroll. ""While seemingly mundane, these are attractive markets demonstrating consistent and sustainable growth,'' ValueAct said. ""They are scale businesses that rely on complex internal technology as a core part of operations, and deliver their product to customers primarily via digital platforms.'' Citigroup can return $50 billion in capital to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next two years and double its earnings per share by 2020, ValueAct said.",4.0

1543966,OECD forum spotlights ‘what brings us together’ as a response to rising populism,"Thousands of officials, civil society leaders, private sector players and economic experts have convened this week in Paris for the annual summit of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a 35-nation intergovernmental economic body dedicated to promoting trade and economic progress. Much like the World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos in January, the OECD is forwarding its vision of a more inclusive world, with a market-based system that promotes democratic values and sustainable growth. And it's a vision that both organizations seem to fear is under threat against a rising tide of populism, where nationalist political parties and policies have seen a series of victories across Western nations in the past two years — from Brexit in the U.K. to the election of Donald Trump and, most recently, the Italian elections. A message of unity and common bonds, the OECD appears to hope, will drive home the message that there are alternatives to anti-immigrant, anti-globalist and protectionist agendas. The theme of this year's summit is ""What brings us together."" This theme, the OECD's website says, will focus on ""moving from diagnosis to action, and shaping solutions to build these much-needed bridges,"" by highlighting key concepts like inclusive growth, international cooperation and digitalization. The week's panels span a range of topics related to development and economics, from artificial intelligence (AI) and gender and LGBT rights to preserving the environment and the future of work. Founded in 1961, the OECD seeks to promote democracy and the market economy among its members and partners, establishing international standards and formulating best practices. It grew out of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, which was created in 1948 to administer the Marshall plan, America's aid program for war-battered Europe. Headquartered in Paris, it has 2,500 staff and a budget of 374 million euros ($435 million). Most of its 35 member states are high-income countries with a high Human Development Index, and together they comprise more than 62 percent of global nominal gross domestic product (GDP) — that's GDP adjusted for market fluctuations — and 43 percent of GDP at purchasing power parity, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The OECD also has official United Nations observer status, meaning it can work with the UN General Assembly. It publishes hundreds of books and research reports each year. The organization also oversees numerous partnership and subcommittees focused on specific areas like business — through the Business and Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC) — and trade, via its Trade Union Advisory Committee (TUAC). Its work extends to emerging economies through entities like the Africa Partnership Forum and the Sahel and West Africa Club, as well as the OECD's Eurasia Week, which works to address challenges in Eurasian economies. This week will see the accession of two new member states: Colombia and Lithuania. Its broader engagement initiatives will also include the signing of a memorandum of understanding for a new Thailand country program, the expansion of OECD-South Africa Cooperation, and the establishment of an OECD Istanbul center. Criticisms of the OECD include perceived narrowness of its membership; it excludes major market players like China, and critics point to an overarching like-mindedness of its members as hindering more effective outreach and engagement. Some call the OECD a ""rich man's club,"" although it has succeeded in bringing once-undeveloped countries under its umbrella, including South Korea, which went from having a GDP equivalent to Ghana's in 1965 to becoming one of the most advanced economies in the world. Part of its mandate is bringing more of these success stories to fruition. It's also facing competition from other monitoring and governance bodies, including the Financial Stability Forum, the G20, the World Bank and the WEF. The OECD operates by consensus of its members; while this means a more equitable decision-making process, it also means policy decisions are made much more slowly. But it has produced important work on issues like corruption, civil liberties, consumer protection and responsible mining, among other things, its supporters point out. Its reporting on tax avoidance and rankings on educational standards have pushed members to pursue better policies on those fronts, and its work is fully-funded by its members. While ""reflecting on the complexity of shaping policy in a post-truth world,"" as its website says, the nearly 60-year old organization faces a new set of challenges in the form of growing trade protectionism and a shift toward illiberalism among some of its member states. It will also have to balance policy in a world of global growth recovery paired with emerging, idiosyncratic risks. These fast-growing trends will test the effectiveness and relevance of the organization and its ability to bring the world back to its core values of liberal democracy, globalization and free trade.",3.0
1550598,Here are some of the best summer discounts you can get in July,"Summer is here, and that means it’s time for barbecues and beach days, but also savings on some key services and retail products. Recently, smart shopping expert Trae Bodge of Slickdeals spoke to CNBC’s “On the Money” to share a few of the best deals that can be found this month. On the heels of the E3 Electronics Expo and with school out, Bodge said game deals are hot right now — especially when it comes to gaming bundles. “If you’re a member of PlayStation, or Xbox or even BestBuy - there are some free bundles that are being given away and BestBuy is having a $10 off deal as well.” Most people think of January as the best time of year for fitness deals, but there are actually some deals to be had during the hot summer months. “We all want to look great going into the summertime so we see a lot deals in fitness apparel, footwear, "" Bodge said. Specifically, shoppers can find 40 to 55 percent in stores like Foot Locker, Finish Line and Nike. Last year’s Amazon Prime Day was the biggest Amazon sale day, ever according to Bodge. Amazon sold proprietary devices like the Echo Dot and Kindle at deep discounts, and in record numbers. Other top selling items included the Instant Pot and the 23andMe DNA test. However, not all the deals have been well received. According to a survey conducted by SlickDeals, 55 percent of Americans found the Amazon Prime Day deals to be “just OK.” While the exact date has not been released yet for 2018, Bodge speculated it will most likely take place in mid-July. In order to stay on top the deals most important to you, Bodge recommended setting up deal alerts for those particular items, using a price tracking website. “You’ll get a little alert to know when that item’s on sale and then you can pounce on it then - instead of watching the deals all day long.” Yes, the kids just got out of school, but it’s not too early to do some of your back to school shopping. Warm weather apparel is on sale now and kids can still wear those warm weather items into September and October. Consumers can find deals in stores like s JCPenney, Gymboree and Old Navy. If your child is looking for a new backpack – Bodge said Staples will be offering 25 percent off backpacks in the last two weeks of July, with a purchase of school supplies. But for the majority of your back to school gear, the shopping expert said it's best to wait until August. If you’re looking for a new patio table or grill – Bodge said to watch for deals timed to the Fourth of July holiday. However the sales will be bigger at the end of the season, when stores are looking to clear out their inventory.",4.0
1550708,"State Dept aims to cut Iran oil exports to zero, leaves some leeway","A senior State Department official on Monday reaffirmed the Trump administration's goal of reducing Iran's oil exports to zero by November. However, he signaled that some importers could get leeway to taper off purchases beyond the deadline. Oil prices soared to new multiyear highs last week after another State Department official told reporters the administration is from Iran by Nov. 4. The announcement shocked the market because some oil watchers expected Washington to let importers reduce their purchases over many months, a model first implemented by the Obama administration. Brian Hook, the State Department's director of policy planning, reiterated the administration's hardline stance, but addressed the market's concerns during the Monday briefing. ""Our goal is to increase pressure on the Iranian regime by reducing to zero its revenues from crude oil sales. We are working to minimize disruptions to the global market, but we are confident that there is sufficient global spare oil production capacity,"" he said. On Saturday, President Donald Trump said Saudi Arabia's king had by as much as 2 million barrels a day — twice what the Saudis agreed to a week earlier at a meeting of two dozen producer nations. The White House later walked back Trump's claim that the leaders had reached an agreement, saying Saudi Arabia would consider hiking output further if necessary and after consulting its oil market allies. Hook also appeared to acknowledge that some oil buyers in countries such as China and Turkey may still be purchasing Iranian barrels by the time the November deadline arrives. He said the administration is unlikely to grant broad waivers for countries, but left open the possibility of granting some import licenses for nations attempting to comply with the sanctions. ""We are not looking to grant licenses or waivers broadly on the re-imposition of sanctions because we believe pressure is critical to achieve our national security objectives,"" he said. ""We are prepared to work with countries that are reducing their imports on a case-by-case basis, but as with our other sanctions, we are not looking to grant waivers or licenses,"" he added. According to Hook, 50 companies around the world have agreed to stop buying oil from Iran following consultations between U.S. State and Treasury officials and their counterparts in Europe and Asia. Sanctions experts in the Obama administration allowed companies to continue conducting some business with Iran, so long as their countries reduced Iranian crude imports by at least 20 percent every 180 days. The measure aimed to prevent a sudden, uncontrolled collapse of the Iranian economy or a precipitous spike in oil prices while international negotiators hammered out a deal with Iran to limit its nuclear activity. Trump abandoned that accord in May, in the process restoring wide-ranging sanctions against Iran that are widely opposed by Europe, China and Russia, which negotiated the 2015 agreement with the Obama administration. The European Union has asked Trump for a blanket waiver so they can preserve the nuclear deal by maintaining business ties with Iran. The EU has put in place measures blocking the U.S. penalties, but European companies are still preparing to comply with the U.S. sanctions. Despite the dispute over the nuclear deal, Hook said the nations are united in their opposition to Iran's role in conflicts in places like Yemen and Syria. ""We believe that China and Russia and the other countries who are part of the Iran deal are tired of the terrorism that Iran is causing; they don't support the proliferation of missiles around the Middle East. They don't support this ... vast proxy network of terrorism,"" he said. To be sure, while the EU opposes Syrian president Bashar Assad, Russia and Iran are his two chief backers in Syria's long-burning civil war. Russia has allowed Iran to build up a significant military position in Syria, which is believed to support the flow of weapons from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean.",4.5
1553813,Warren Buffett finds an elephant in Berkshire's own backyard,"Warren Buffett has looked around for suitable ways to invest Berkshire Hathaway's $106 billion cash hoard, and he has finally come up with an idea: Berkshire Hathaway. The move sent Berkshire shares soaring more than 5 percent on Wednesday. Starting in August, the Omaha conglomerate may buy back more shares, joining a huge number of other American companies that have embraced share purchases as a way to use cash piles swollen by tax cuts and strong earnings. Berkshire's board approved a change in how Buffett and his longtime lieutenant, Charlie Munger, decide whether to use the cash for share purchases. Late Tuesday, Berkshire said the decision would rest on whether Buffett and Munger both agree the trading price is below Berkshire's intrinsic value. That sounds innocuous enough, but it's a big shift from the yardstick Berkshire has used in the last couple of years. The old policy prevented Berkshire from buying its stock if it was trading higher than 120 percent of book value. Berkshire's book value, based on its B shares, is estimated at $149 a share, while its intrinsic value is more like $236, according to calculations by J.P. Morgan Chase analysts. The shares currently are trading at around $199. Based on book value, Berkshire wouldn't be able to buy back shares at this level under the old policy. But it would be able to buy them back based on intrinsic value under the new policy. Berkshire said it is sticking with the old policy that it won't spend down the cash pile below $20 billion, meaning it has about $86 billion or so to use. ""The new policy provides Berkshire with more flexibility to deploy excess cash of about $86 billion that is a large drag on returns, particularly given Berkshire has not been able to find attractively valued acquisitions in an expensive market,"" wrote Sarah DeWitt, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, in a note on Tuesday. Buffett has long pointed out in Berkshire's annual letters to shareholders that the gap between the company's book value and its intrinsic value has been widening in recent years. The latter is an estimate of the future cash output of a business discounted to present value. In other words, book value tells you how much money was put into a business; intrinsic value says how much money can be pulled out. The last time Berkshire bought its own shares was in 2012. That year, Buffett told investors, was lackluster. Berkshire's book value didn't increase on pace with the gain in the S&P, and Buffett failed to make a major acquisition. ""I pursued a couple of elephants, but came up empty handed,"" he said then. Berkshire didn't purchase any shares in 2013 because the stock didn't meet the 120 percent hurdle. In turning to share purchases, Buffett is also signaling there isn't anything he feels comfortable buying at current values. Berkshire hasn't had good luck on the deal front in a while, backing down from an offer for Texas power transmission firm Oncor after a bidding war broke out last year and abandoning a potential deal for Unilever. With a flood of money at private equity firms waiting to be invested and Wall Street's willingness to pile on debt to get a deal done, Berkshire's classically frugal deal style is out of favor, said David Rolfe, the chief investment officer of St. Louis-based Wedgewood Partners, a long-time holder of Berkshire B shares. Share purchases are a bullish sign that a company sees its shares as undervalued. ""It's a high-class problem,"" Rolfe told CNBC. Buffett famously said a few years back that he was going ""elephant hunting"" to find big takeover targets to put Berkshire's cash to work. ""All along, the biggest elephant has been at the Omaha zoo. In his own company,"" Rolfe said.",3.5
1554089,Farnborough Airshow: Six aircraft that are grabbing attention,"The 2018 Farnborough International Airshow has exhibited the latest in military hardware, commercial aircraft, flying cars and space technology. It's also a big battle ground for aerospace giants Boeing and Airbus as they aim to win new customers. So far, Boeing has managed to get more orders than Airbus, but both planemakers have enjoyed a healthy stream of business. CNBC takes you through some of the aircraft on display at the U.K. event as companies look to impress prospective buyers. Airbus came to Farnborough armed with its new A220-300 plane, specifically designed for the 130-160 seat market. The plane was formerly known as the Bombardier CSeries before the Canadian company sold its controlling stake in the program to Airbus. At Farnborough, the founder of Jet Blue, David Neeleman, spent $5.5 billion on 60 of the planes to help launch his U.S. start-up airline. Brazilian planemaker Embraer recently gave up a controlling stake in its commercial aircraft division to Boeing. Its E190-E2 is seen as a rival to the Airbus A220-300 in the battle within the small jetliner market. Due to better-than-expected fuel burn during tests in January, Embraer has increased the aircraft’s range to 2,880 nautical miles. The plane arrived in Farnborough sporting a hugely aggressive shark face. British sports carmaker Aston Martin has joined the likes of Uber, Airbus and Rolls-Royce in a bid to build a short-hop flying vehicle. The Volante Vision concept debuted at Farnborough and is pitched as a three-seat luxury vehicle. It is designed for vertical take-off and landing and is being developed with the help of Cranfield Aerospace Solutions and Rolls-Royce. This new RAF fighter jet is being developed in a joint venture by Rolls Royce, MBDA, BAE Systems and Italian firm Leonardo. It was announced by U.K. Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson on Monday with a mock-up placed behind him. The jet is to receive an initial £2 billion worth of development money and is seen as being key to maintaining the U.K.’s “control of the air,” Williamson said. It will eventually replace the Eurofighter Typhoon. U.K. firm Hybrid Air Vehicles has used Farnborough to unveil a “luxury” passenger cabin for the world’s largest aircraft, the Airlander 10. The cabin is 151 feet long and the British manufacturer said up to 19 passengers will be able to take part in three-day expeditions. The aircraft has had teething issues, including a crash during a test flight in August 2016. Boeing’s 737 MAX has left a big mark on the 2018 Farnborough Airshow, with the aircraft once again proving a best seller. The mid-sized airliner, which is lauded for its fuel efficiency, has racked up more than 400 orders and intents to buy. Boeing says the 737 MAX is the fastest-selling airplane in its history.",4.0

1567587,US-Japan trade talks: Tokyo to stay cautious,"Japan has long been resistant to a free trade agreement with the United States but faced with the threat of harsh tariffs, the Asian giant appears to have changed its mind. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Donald Trump agreed to start trade negotiations on Wednesday in an move that will likely shield Tokyo from Trump's proposed 25 percent duty on imports of Japanese vehicles and automotive parts. But entering talks was considered a major concession for Abe, who will now have to carefully manage U.S. demands to open up his country's sensitive agriculture sector. ""This was something that, for various reasons over the years, Japan was unwilling to do and now they are willing to do,"" Trump said at a meeting with Abe in New York. Before Trump's threat of auto tariffs, Tokyo had previously made clear that it preferred the multilateral framework of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Trump exited in 2017, over a two-way arrangement. As the countries now prepare to discuss goods, services and investment, Abe is widely expected to keep his guard up to prevent criticism at home. Given Japan's precarious position — appease Trump or get hit with duties that target a large chunk of Japanese exports headed stateside — Abe's government ""will still be cautious when it comes to bilateral talks with the United States,"" analysts at research firm Stratfor said in a Wednesday note. In a joint statement, Washington and Tokyo said they were aiming for ""a United States-Japan Trade Agreement on goods, as well as on other key areas including services, that can produce early achievements."" The fact that the statement didn't include the phrase ""free trade agreement"" is significant, according to Glen Fukushima, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan policy institute. ""The Japanese side will hesitate using the word FTA because it will make it appear as if they're switching from a multilateral approach to a bilateral approach,"" he told CNBC. Other experts offered a more optimistic take on Wednesday's news, arguing that talks were not so much a concession as a change of heart on Tokyo's part. Japan now believes it can lead on multilateral pacts like the now-11-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership while simultaneously striking a deal with the world's largest economy, said Robert Holleyman, who served as deputy U.S. Trade Representative from 2014 to 2017. ""It's good to know that we are moving at least past the notion that it's either one or the another,"" he continued. In fact, Holleyman said, a U.S.-Japan deal could lead to Washington rejoining the Trans-Pacific trade deal. Trump's team — led by Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer — is expected to push Tokyo hard, especially on agriculture, where U.S. producers have been disadvantaged by high Japanese import duties. For example, American beef entering Japan currently faces a 38.5 percent tariff rate, but Australia, which has a bilateral trade deal with Japan, has a 27.2 percent rate on its beef. And with Canberra's rate set to decrease to 19 percent, the need for Washington to ink its own deal with Tokyo is even more urgent, said Fukushima. ""If the U.S. had stayed in TPP, the tariffs for U.S. and Australian beef would have gone down to 9 percent, but because we withdrew, we're now suffering from this gap,"" he said. Abe, however, still has some bargaining power, according to experts. ""On agriculture, where talks will likely focus on non-tariff barriers, Japan has already managed to gain greater leeway because it weakened the agricultural lobby's influence before signing the TPP,"" the Statfor note said. Japan can also leverage its massive manufacturing presence in the U.S., it continued, adding that ""wherever negotiations lead, Abe's recent success in winning a third term as prime minister will give him freer reign in talks with his country's longtime ally.",4.0
1569140,Angelina Jolie: What She Tells Her Daughters Is 'Most Important',"Angelina Jolie knows just how to encourage her young daughters to be the best version of themselves. “I often tell my daughters that the most important thing they can do is to develop their minds,” Jolie wrote. “You can always put on a pretty dress, but it doesn’t matter what you wear on the outside if your mind isn’t strong. There is nothing more attractive—you might even say enchanting—than a woman with an independent will and her own opinions.” The Maleficent: Mistress of Evil actress also took the time to praise her three sons — Maddox, 18, Pax, 15, and Knox, 11 — for how they’re growing into respectful gentlemen. “I could not be prouder of my sons for the men they are becoming, the way they respect their sisters and are respected by them,” she wrote. Jolie shares her six kids with ex Brad Pitt. Earlier in the essay, Jolie also touched on how hard it is for women to be their true selves while struggling under the pressure to be perfect. But Jolie has some simple advice to help women get there. “Who we are meant to be in life is something we all have to work out for ourselves,” Jolie wrote. “I think we can often go offtrack as women, because our instinct is to nurture or to adjust ourselves to society’s expectations. It can be hard to take the time to ask ourselves who we truly want to be—not what we think other people will approve of or accept, but who we really are. But when you listen to yourself, you can make the choice to step forward and learn and change.” Jolie is set to make her Marvel Cinematic Universe debut in The Eternals next year, and she recently told PEOPLE that her children are excited to see her in such a powerful role. “What’s really moving to me is that they want to see me strong, and so it’s less to see me in a film, but they’re just happy I will be strong and having fun,” Jolie said.

1569400,"Meet the start-up that powers Venmo, Robinhood and other big apps","Banking applications don't usually create a buzz at ""hackathon"" events. But two consultants in their early 20s were running out of options. It was five years ago, and the pair had just quit their steady jobs at the consulting firm Bain & Co. They had an idea to build technology that linked banks and consumers through apps, but the 70 investors they had already pitched weren't buying it. So, they decided to prove their concept would work. William Hockey and Zach Perret spent two adrenaline and caffeine-fueled days at the 2013 TechCrunch Disrupt hackathon in Manhattan, sleeping in sporadic hour-long shifts, building an app that showed users their debit and credit card transactions on a map. The duo, plus a friend who helped out for free, ended up winning the competition and the attention of investors. ""At these hackathons, it's usually, 'Here's my new social app, or here's my new dating app for my college sorority.' Nobody had ever built a financial application,"" said Hockey, co-founder of the winning app, called Rambler, as well as the fintech start-up Plaid. ""No one believed in our product — we figured, let's just go build something on our own technology."" Rambler is long gone but its underlying technology has since become a household name among fintech developers. That technology, Plaid's APIs, has attracted investments from the venture arms of Goldman Sachs, Citi and American Express, and some say, has helped accelerate the growth of the payment sector over the past five years. Despite popularity with coders, the average person interacting with Plaid most likely wouldn't recognize the company. It quietly powers everything from the popular peer-to-peer payment app Venmo to the mobile investing apps Robinhood and Acorns to cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Gemini. Plaid says it integrates with more than 10,000 banks, and connects to roughly 20 million consumer accounts. While it does not give specific numbers or a full list of companies, Plaid said its customer base doubled from 2017 to 2018. ""Plaid has quietly created a very big infrastructure without the consumer knowing that they're powering it,"" said Christopher Dawe, co-head of private investment at Goldman Sachs Investment Partners. Dawe, who led Goldman's 2016 Series B investment in Plaid, said the company's low-key, behind-the-scenes operating culture mirrors that of its founders. ""I actually think that approach is thematic of their leadership style,"" Dawe said. Hockey and Perret met in Atlanta as associates at Bain and immediately bonded over a of love rock climbing and coding. They worked as consultants for less than a year before deciding, as 29-year-old Hockey put it, they preferred ""pushing code to pushing power points."" Their original ambition was to create a consumer finance app, but certain roadblocks they hit became a new inspiration altogether. ""We started to realize we were struggling so much of the time because we couldn't connect anything to financial services,"" Hockey, now Plaid's chief technology officer, said in an interview at the company's San Francisco office. ""The fundamental building blocks that make it really easy to build an application, we just couldn't find."" The founders left Atlanta and headed to New York. They crashed on friends' couches and spent the better part of 18 months working on the new idea. The recent college graduates had been coding for years. Hockey started when he was 12, fixing neighbors' computers in California as a hobby, and Perret, now 31, picked it up in his late teens. The two built an original prototype for Plaid and raised enough money to move forward and ""build, heads down,"" for 20 hours at a time. The TechCrunch hackathon was the first time a team had built a full-scale financial services application live, in less than 24 hours, they said. After they won, ""a lot of people started paying attention,"" including venture capitalists. They moved the company to San Francisco in order to expand and find engineering talent. Plaid now employs nearly 200 people, many of whom get together on Thursdays to go rock climbing. And in the case someone gets stuck in the office, there's a climbing wall there, too. As they were building out the tech, a friend who happened to be the head of engineering at PayPal-owned Venmo showed interest. He was looking for a better way to link Venmo's peer-to-peer payment app to bank accounts, and asked Hockey and Perret to test what they had been working on. They didn't jump at the opportunity. ""He kind of lobbied us for a couple months and finally we were like 'alright sure',"" said Perret, who is now Plaid's CEO. ""It was a great proof-point to see tons of people using Plaid at scale inside of Venmo, which then helped launch us into a lot of other applications."" Venmo and other applications rely on Plaid's protocol known as application programming interface, or API. The acronym is not unique to the banking sector but Plaid's version does a lot of the heavy lifting on the back end that could otherwise take days. Without a third party like Plaid, start-ups would have to hire their own engineers and create their own ways to sync with banks. A company spokeswoman likened the problem to traveling abroad with a hair dryer. When you try to plug a U.S. appliance into a foreign outlet, the volts and the physical shape of the plug won't line up. If you jam the plug in, the dryer will spark, overheat, or just not work. Plaid, in this case acts as the adapter, enabling the outlet (the bank in this metaphor) to connect with the hair dryer (Venmo, to use an example) and work. That's a simple description for what they do — Plaid also adds analysis on top of the bank account so app users are able to do things like budgeting or expense management. It can authenticate bank accounts for direct payroll deposits and electronic bill payments, verify someone's identity, verify someone's balance in real time and understand income and employment. It is otherwise difficult to link to a bank account. Without a quick way to verify account ownership, for example, the other solution is the much slower trial deposit method. It's easy to forget the slow pain of depositing 4 cents at a time in an account and waiting for a customer to confirm the deposit details. Plaid gained legitimacy by getting early adoption by companies like Robinhood, which notched a $5.6 billion valuation in its latest funding this spring. It has also benefited from a domino effect and word of mouth, the founders said. When companies do sign up, it's often during their early years — at the same point when managers are deciding whether to build off of Amazon Web Services or Microsoft's Azure for cloud computing. ""Not every platform is going to take off the way that Venmo and some of these other household names have in the fintech space,"" said Goldman's Dawe. ""But for those that do, you get this portfolio effect of companies finding Plaid without having to market to them."" U.S. cryptocurrency start-up Coinbase, now valued at a reported $8 billion, is one customer that found Plaid through word of mouth after using a competing API. Its product is innately more complicated than most others in fintech. Instead of moving dollars to dollars, Coinbase takes money from a bank account and moves it in and out of irreversible and volatile payment methods like bitcoin. Coinbase uses Plaid to link those accounts and to flag fraud on its trading platform. ""If you have a scammer trying to buy a $100,000 in crypto, and the bank account itself isn't funded to that level, the ability to check that in real time is really, really valuable,"" said Dan Romero, vice president and general manager of Coinbase Consumer. ""We have moved billions of dollars through the U.S. banking system through Plaid."" Romero said Hockey and Perret have a way of under-promising and over delivering, a rare trait in competitive start-up culture. While Plaid is not a household name among consumers, Romero said it's extremely well known among developers, and that name recognition has helped Coinbase add to its own ""legitimacy."" ""They're built for engineers in particular,"" said Derrick Fung, CEO of another Plaid customer called Drop. ""All the transaction data that's fed to us — they clean it up so it's displayed in a way that's recognizable."" Chris Britt, CEO of Chime, also uses Plaid. The banking app start-up's direct deposit function would be impossible without Plaid's technology. Because applications pay based on the number of users and how actively those users are engaging with their product, Plaid has been able to grow along with the portfolio of companies it works with. ""They really ride the wave of all of this explosive growth of fintech,"" said Britt. That growth has been fueled by a steady wave of venture funding. The total deal value of venture capital money going to fintech companies in 2018 has reached $7.5 billion, according to data from Pitchbook, up from $6.9 billion last year. Banks certainly don't want to miss out on that wave. Dawe met first met Plaid executives in Los Angeles ahead of the Series B funding. Plaid raised $44 million in its last round from Citi Ventures, American Express Ventures, New Enterprise Associates and Goldman Sachs Investment Partners in June 2016, putting its valuation at $225 million, according to Pitchbook. Other investors include Google Ventures and Spark Capital. The Goldman team said they saw value in the founders, the sector itself and some of the evolutionary forces behind its growth. Plaid is generating revenue according to Pitchbook, although it declined to say how much. And it has developed a competitive advantage — or moat — despite other venture-backed companies in the sector. Yodlee, which has raised $660 million, is its main competitor, according to Pitchbook. ""It was about the data network effects, and what we thought was a sustainable moat or advantage compared to other companies in the space,"" Dawe said. ""Our belief is that Plaid becomes part of the connective tissue where developers rely on their tech in order to understand the user behavior of the customer."" The technology eases certain technical burdens for start-ups, and has helped the sector take off in recent years, according to Gartner's Chief of Research Rajesh Kandaswamy. ""Even if they don't have capital, doing things quickly is important for a developer. For many fintech companies who don't the dollars yet, Plaid became an option,"" Kandaswamy said. ""It has enabled companies to grow, and brings down the capital costs — including time and effort."" Kandaswamy said technologies like API are much more important for banking than for other industries. But while banks have become more comfortable layering with fintech companies, there is a chance they could eventually get rid of the need for a middleman. The U.K. is on the forefront of ""open banking,"" and EU law now requires companies to release their data in a secure and standardized form, so that it can be shared more seamlessly between organizations online. ""Regulatory changes in some regions are accelerating open banking and resetting the rules of competition,"" Gartner said in a recent note to clients. Still, Plaid is much more bullish on cooperating with banks than disrupting them. While they acknowledge risks, they said they're looking to expand current offerings and see long-term opportunity as a middle man. ""The banks themselves are winning,"" Perret said. ""We think of it as this virtuous cycle where we're enabling more speed and efficiency, creating more net innovation, and ultimately giving people greater value in the financial system.""",4.5
1569611,Millie Bobby Brown Embodies Individuality and the Power of the Individual in Her New Campaign with Pandora,"Millie Bobby Brown and Pandora are teaming up to celebrate the power of self expression. The 15-year-old Stranger Things star captivated audiences across the country with her role as Eleven on the hit Netflix show, but it’s her commitment to leaving a positive mark off screen that makes her a perfect match for the jewelry brand’s new empowering campaign.  And her mark has not been small.  Professionally, Brown has made prominent strides in her role as Eleven — even racking up two EMMY nominations, more recently as Madison Russell in Godzilla: King of the Monsters.  As a philanthropist, Brown has become an important supporter of UNICEF and is now the organization’s youngest-ever Goodwill Ambassador.  And as a rising star, Brown’s accomplishment have been recognized by her spot on the TIME’s 100 list of most influential people.  To promote her new campaign with Pandora, the actress traveled back to her hometown of Atlanta, Georgia, to model personally curated selections from the new collection.  “I love Pandora because everyone can tell their own story, and each symbol can represent your individuality,” Brown tells PEOPLE.  The campaign will also feature a video in which Brown delves into her personal connection to the pieces and her youthful, fearless approach to individual style. While her list of accomplishments may sound like they belong to a much older star, Brown was quite young during her rise to fame (she was only 12 in the first season of Stranger Things). Since then, she has shown her maturity through her presence on social media, dedication to social justice and involvement in various charities. At just 15, Brown has experienced a lot of growth through the roller-coaster of young fame, as well as her experience dealing with cyber-bullying and relationships in the spotlight — and she’s using her platform to spread her positive message. Pandora’s Chief Creative and Brand Officer, Stephen Fairchild, said “Millie Bobbie Brown is the perfect ambassador for the next generation of Pandora jewellery that empowers young women to express themselves.” The campaign, which will go live digitally in October, is part of Pandora’s upcoming brand relaunch, through which the company strives to refresh its identity, purpose and expression.   ",4.0

1573488,Kevin O'Leary: 3 things that make a great business pitch,"Master Class As an investor on ABC's ""Shark Tank,"" Kevin O'Leary has heard a decade of pitches — the good, the bad and the wacky. If anyone knows the perfect pitch, it's him. In fact, there's a three-part formula to a successful pitch, O'Leary tells CNBC Make It. ""[It] doesn't determine the outcome of the business,"" O'Leary notes. ""But these three are found in every case where an entrepreneur is successful in getting money."" Here's how to get an investor to write you a check, according to O'Leary: ""You have to explain exactly what the business is in less than 90 seconds,"" O'Leary tells CNBC Make It. ""If you can't do that, you'll never be successful. You have to be succinct about the opportunity."" ""You have to explain why you're the right person to execute the business plan,"" O'Leary tells CNBC Make It. That can be anything from experience in the industry to working for a competitor or even what you've learned from past failures and mistakes. ""You've got a good idea, now, who's going to run the show? Is it you? You've got to tell me why. ""A great idea with a great entrepreneur with executional skills are the first two elements,"" he says. The final element is what O'Leary calls ""the killer."" ""You have to know your numbers,"" he says. You need to be able to tell potential investors how big the market is, how fast it's growing, how many competitors there are, the break-even analysis — and more. You have to have that down-pat; if not, your pitch falls apart. ""If you get the first two right, and you don't know your numbers, you deserve to burn in purgatory, and I will put you there,"" O'Leary says.

1579480,Texans QB McCarron (thumb) could miss preseason,"Houston Texans backup quarterback A.J. McCarron could miss the preseason with a hand injury suffered in practice Tuesday, the Houston Chronicle reported Wednesday. McCarron, signed by Houston in March to back up Deshaun Watson, appeared to hurt his right thumb on his follow-through during a joint practice with Green Bay and left the field in pain. Head coach Bill O’Brien did not offer any update on McCarron’s status following the practice. According to the report, the 28-year-old McCarron was expected to play at least two quarters in the first preseason game Thursday against the Packers. Joe Webb, the third quarterback, will likely play most of the game. A 2014 fifth-round draft pick of the Cincinnati Bengals after a decorated career at Alabama, McCarron spent his first four seasons with the Bengals, showing flashes of potential when filling in for Andy Dalton. But since filing a grievance against the club and being granted free agency in February 2018, McCarron has become a bit of a journeyman. In March 2018, he signed a two-year, $10 million contract with Buffalo. But on Sept. 2 of last year, a week before the start of the season, the Bills traded McCarron to Oakland in exchange for a 2019 fifth-round pick. The Raiders cut him in March. McCarron played in two games with the Raiders last season, completing 1 of 3 passes for 8 yards. He is 87 of 136 for 928 yards, six touchdowns and two interceptions in his career. —Field Level Media",3.5
1581956,"Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey talks coffee, cannabis strategy","Coca-Cola's $5.1 billion acquisition of U.K. coffee chain Costa was less of an effort to take on giants like Starbucks than a move to create a new type of coffee experience, Coca-Cola President and CEO James Quincey tells CNBC. To Quincey, who joined Jim Cramer for an exclusive interview Friday, the coffee industry has split into three overarching parts: the ""ready-to-drink piece,"" the ""at-home"" segment and immediate consumption at coffee shops. ""The biggest piece is in immediate consumption channels. And, actually, while coffee shops exist, the biggest piece is the rest,"" Quincey said on ""Mad Money."" ""Helping other customers have a store in a store and executing coffee within other people's outlets is a big opportunity for them, and I think there's a lot of white space to do a lot better around the world."" Coca-Cola, a $213 billion beverage maker, was criticized by some for paying too much for Costa, a former Whitbread subsidiary with nearly 4,000 international locations, most of them in the United Kingdom. But the U.K.-born Quincey, who pegged coffee's total addressable market at roughly $500 billion, sees a yet-unlocked opportunity to deliver quality coffee quickly at existing locations like gas stations and convenience stores. ""Our idea is not to go head to head"" with companies like Starbucks and Nestle, which made a $7 billion licensing deal with Starbucks in May, the CEO said. ""Whether you want to call it food service or partnering with customers to get stores on, the express is like the top-end vending machine for coffee that gets a barista experience, whether it's in a petrol station, a convenience store, at work,"" Quincey said. ""We have store in stores in cinemas. So there's a massive opportunity to partner with customers to sell more coffee, really high-quality barista coffee, in someone else's store."" But where coffee provides opportunities, cannabis seems laden with obstacles, Quincey said, addressing Coca-Cola's likelihood to break into the rapidly expanding marijuana market. While some alcohol brands are already exploring ways to create drinks infused with THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, Coca-Cola would only consider incorporating CBD, the plant's non-active, medically inclined component, in its products, the CEO said. ""The way I think about ingredients is the following: Is it legal? Is it safe? And is it consumable?"" Quincey said. ""Is it legal? It's not legal in the U.S. It's not even legal for beverages in Canada yet. Is it safe? Science is out. We believe our consumers want to trust us that our beverages are indisputably safe, and therefore, we want to see consensus science behind any ingredient, whichever one it is."" ""We want to sell drinks that people can drink each day. So it's not like you have something once,"" the CEO continued. ""You have one a day. And if you can't cross [off] those three things of legal, safe and consumable, it's not an ingredient that's going to work for us."" Coca-Cola's stock hit a new 52-week high in Friday's trading session, ultimately closing up 0.86 percent at $50.17 a share. The company third-quarter earnings report in late October impressed Wall Street, with 30-percent profit growth and a double-digit sales jump in the company's Coke Zero Sugar brand.

1584104,"Mormons support GOP, but Trump approval lags","About two-thirds of Mormon voters nationwide favored Republicans in the midterm elections, but President Donald Trump's approval rating among members of the faith lagged behind, according to a nationwide survey of midterm voters. And as Republican Sen. Mitt Romney prepares to join the new Congress in January, most voters in the predominantly Mormon state of Utah — 64 percent — would like to see the senator confront the president, AP VoteCast found. About half of Romney's supporters — including his Mormon supporters — said they would like to see the former Massachusetts governor stand up to Trump, while about as many indicated the senator should support Trump if elected. The new data reaffirms Trump's struggle to gain widespread acceptance among Mormons despite the faith's deep-rooted conservative leanings. Voters of other religious faiths such as evangelical Christians and Catholics are more consistent in their ratings of the president and vote choice. Across most other religious affiliations, about the same share voted for Republican candidates as said they approve of the president. That's not the case with Mormons: 67 percent voted for Republicans, but 56 percent said they approve of the way Trump is handling his job as president. That's according to an analysis of 1,528 Mormon voters based on data from VoteCast, a survey of more than 115,000 voters nationwide conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago. The data offers an unusual level of detail about the voting decisions of a sometimes misunderstood religion. Among Mormon voters in Utah, 76 percent preferred Republican congressional candidates, but only 56 percent said they approved of Trump. By comparison, 8 in 10 white evangelical Christians nationwide voted for Republican candidates, and nearly as many (79 percent) said they approve of Trump. Among Catholics, nearly half voted for Republican candidates and said they approve of Trump (49 percent each). Nationally, 45 percent of voters said they approve of the way Trump is handling his job as president, while 55 percent disapprove. Among Republican voters nationwide, 85 percent said they approve of the way Trump is handling his job as president. Trump has struggled since he was a presidential candidate to gain acceptance among Mormons and in Utah, where the mostly Mormon electorate has long been uncomfortable with his brash style and his comments about women and immigrants. He won the deep-red state in the 2016 election, but many conservative voters cast ballots instead for third-party candidate Evan McMullin as Trump earned the lowest percentage of the vote among GOP presidential candidates since 1992. Members of the religion, which forbids its members from using alcohol or tobacco and teaches that gay marriage and homosexual relationships are a sin, place a high value on manners, amiability and public diplomacy. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a Utah-based faith that counts 6.6 million members in the United States. According to VoteCast, a majority of Mormons said Trump does not have the right temperament to serve effectively as president (58 percent), while just about 4 in 10 (42 percent) said he does. Forty-six percent of Mormons said the president is honest and trustworthy. Support for Trump among Mormons nationally was slightly lower among more educated members of the faith. College-educated Mormons were far more likely to vote for Republican candidates than to express approval of the president (73 percent versus 51 percent), while there is no significant gap among Mormons without a college degree (63 percent voted for Republicans, and 60 percent approve of Trump). By contrast, Romney is widely revered in Utah and by Mormons for being a high-profile member of the Mormon faith in America and for his work in turning around Salt Lake City's 2002 Winter Olympics after a bribery scandal. Romney captured 63 percent of the vote to win the U.S. Senate seat vacated by retiring Republican Orrin Hatch, also a Mormon. VoteCast showed about 8 in 10 Mormon voters in Utah backed Romney (83 percent). Romney called Trump a ""phony"" and ""con man"" during the 2016 presidential race, but their relationship has since thawed. Trump backed Romney for the Senate seat, and Romney has avoided attacking Trump, instead vowing to work with the president on issues they agree on and voice his disagreements when they don't. Just last week, Romney pushed back against Trump's comments on Saudi Arabia, saying they are ""inconsistent"" with U.S. foreign policy. Nearly two-thirds of Utah voters said they would like to see Romney continue to stand up to Trump (64 percent), compared with fewer who would like to see him support Trump (36 percent). Romney voters were divided: Half said they would want him to stand up to Trump, and half preferred he support Trump. Romney's Mormon supporters, in particular, were also equally divided on whether he should stand up to Trump or support him. While the state's two U.S. senators and three of four of its U.S House members are Republican, Democrat Ben McAdams did unseat incumbent Republican Rep. Mia Love to flip the seat and become the first Democrat among Utah's congressional delegation since 2014. McAdams pitches himself to voters as a moderate, and not a typical Democrat, in a district that includes many Salt Lake City suburbs. He was among 16 Democrats who signed a letter vowing not to vote for Nancy Pelosi for House speaker. VoteCast also illustrated Mormons' preference for a mix of compassion and toughness on immigration. Just about half of Mormon voters said they approve of the president on his handling of immigration (52 percent) and border security (54 percent). More say immigrants do more to help the country (55 percent) than hurt the country (41 percent). Nearly 7 in 10 Mormon voters — similar to the share of voters overall — also said immigrants should be offered a chance to apply for legal status, compared with about 3 in 10 saying they should be deported. Still, 54 percent of Mormons were in favor of the U.S.-Mexico border wall. Hundreds of thousands of Mormons have served proselytizing missions around the world, making them more sensitive to Trump's hard-line stances than other Republicans.",3.5

KEY RATING DRIVERS Sufficient Credit Support: The class A1 and A2 notes have sufficient credit enhancement (CE) of 10.0% and 6.5%, respectively, provided by their respective subordinated notes. Conservative Pool Characteristics: The portfolio has weighted-average (WA) seasoning of 45.5 months, a WA unindexed current LVR of 68.0% and a WA indexed current LVR of 65.3%. The average obligor current loan size is AUD221,071. Investment loans represent 18.8% of the pool by balance, interest-only loans represent 16.6% and fixed-rate loans 32.4%. Lenders' mortgage insurance is present on 94.0% of the pool. Sequential/Pro-Rata Paydown: Classes A1 and A2 initially receive principal on a pari-passu basis, with all other note classes receiving principal sequentially prior to the pro-rata test conditions being met. Once pro-rata tests are met, principal will be allocated on a pro-rata basis across all notes. Sufficient Liquidity Support: Liquidity support is provided via excess spread, principal draws and a liquidity facility sized at 0.75% of the note balance, with a facility floor of AUD225,000. The liquidity facility will amortise, subject to the floor, while performance-based triggers are satisfied. Geographic Concentration: Tasmania accounts for 43.8% of the portfolio and Queensland makes up 27.2% due to existing branch networks in these locations. RATING SENSITIVITIES Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's base case and are likely to result in a decline in CE and remaining loss-coverage levels available to the notes. Decreased CE may make certain note ratings susceptible to potential negative rating action, depending on the extent of the coverage decline. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analysis of the ratings by stressing the transaction's initial base-case assumptions. Its analysis found that the class A1 and A2 notes were not affected when foreclosure stresses were increased by 15% and 30%, respectively. When these stresses were used to decrease recoveries the rating of the class A1 notes remained stable at 'AAAsf', however, the class A2 rating reduced to 'AA+sf'. Under a combination stress of 15% increase in defaults and 15% decrease in recoveries, the rating of the class A1 notes remained stable at 'AAAsf', however, the class A2 rating reduced to 'AAsf'. USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10 Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by accessing the appendix referenced under ""Related Research"" below. The appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report titled, ""Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions,"" dated 31 May 2016. DATA ADEQUACY Fitch sought to receive a third-party assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information, but none was made available. Prior to transaction closing, Fitch conducted a review of a small targeted sample of MyState's origination files and found the information contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio. Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that it is adequately reliable. Key rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further discussed in the corresponding new issue report entitled ""Conquest 2016-2 Trust"", published today.

1586154,China to pledge more U.S. soy imports during Trump visit,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will commit to buy more U.S. soybeans during President Donald Trump’s visit to Beijing this week, a U.S. industry official said, underlining the importance of trade in farm goods even as tensions grow between the world’s top two economies. China is the world’s biggest soybean importer and the U.S. is its second largest supplier. Chinese soybean buyers will sign a letter of intent with the U.S. Soybean Export Council committing to purchasing a certain volume of soybeans in the future, Paul Burke, the body’s North Asia regional director, told Reuters by phone on Tuesday. He declined to disclose the volume of beans to be included in the agreement. But Chinese importers said in July they would buy 12.53 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans, the second largest such agreement. The volume under the new deal will be “much less” and will reflect orders due to be signed in the current marketing year that were not included in the July agreement, said Burke. But China will also promise to buy more U.S. soybeans in future, according to a source familiar with the plan. A signing ceremony is scheduled to take place as Trump meets Chinese President Xi Jinping. China will also promise to buy more U.S. beef, barley and dairy products, including cheese, the source said. China dropped a 14-year ban on U.S. beef imports this year. Agriculture trade has been a bright spot in U.S.-China relations under Trump’s administration, unlike other sectors such as steel and aluminum where the two countries have faced disputes. A separate purchase agreement between a Chinese firm and a U.S. agricultural products exporter will also be signed, said Burke, adding he was not aware of details. Major grains trading house ADM(ADM.N) was on an initial list seen by Reuters of U.S. companies taking part in a trade mission accompanying Trump to China but ADM has not confirmed its participation. The U.S. sold 20.7 million tonnes of beans to China in the first nine months of this year, up 14.8 percent from a year ago. In 2016, it sold 38.2 million tonnes, or 40 percent of China’s total soybean imports. China is expected to import 96 million tonnes of soybeans in the 2017/18 marketing year, up from 93.5 million tonnes previously, according to the China National Grain and Oils Information Centre, an official think-tank. The dealmaking comes as U.S. farmers seek to export more beans after growing another record crop but with top exporter Brazil set to steal a share of their sales during the peak selling season.

1587838,India's Modi says most goods to be hit with below 18 percent GST,"India will tax most goods at below 18 percent in a further simplification of the Goods and Services Tax, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, aiming to shore up support among businesses that have struggled with the new system. GST, India's most biggest tax reform, sets rates from 28 percent to 5 percent on most items, replacing an array of federal and state duties. Modi told a conference on Tuesday that the government was looking to simplify the tax that was launched last year and would reduce the number of items in the highest bracket to just luxury goods. ""Today, we are approaching a stage where 99 percent items can be brought under 18 percent,"" Modi said in a speech at an event in Mumbai. ""We firmly believe that GST must be as simple as possible and we are also working constantly in that direction."" Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party faces a tough national election next summer and it is looking to consolidate its voter base among the middle class and businesses. Last week, the party lost three heartland states because of anger over weak farm prices and lack of jobs. Disruptions from the GST and a ban on high currency notes in November 2016 curtailed growth, manufacturing, services and consumer spending. Modi said many developed economies had struggled to implement tax reforms. ""In developed countries too, implementing even small tax reforms is not easy. Like I said earlier, before implementing GST, the number of registered enterprises was just 6.6 million, which has now increased to 12 million.""",3.0
1589288,Here's the tax bite on that $425 million Mega Millions jackpot,"Someone in New York is kicking off the new year a whole lot richer. A single ticket sold on Long Island in the town of Glen Head matched all six numbers in Mega Millions' Tuesday night drawing, nabbing the $425 million jackpot. Of course, the winner won't actually end up with the advertised amount, thanks to taxes. ""Winners are surprised by how much is withheld in taxes from the initial payment, and then how much more is owed with they file their taxes the following year,"" said Jason Kurland, a partner at Rivkin Radler, a law firm in Uniondale, New York. ""All of the numbers involved in these huge jackpots are staggering, and the taxes are no exception,"" said Kurland, who helps big lottery winners navigate their windfall. The person will get to choose between taking the jackpot as an annuity spread out over three decades or as a lump sum of $254.6 million. For federal taxes, lottery officials automatically withhold 24 percent of the money. If the winner goes with the cash option — which most winners do — that withholding would reduce the amount by $61.1 million to $193.5 million. However, with the top federal tax rate at 37 percent, the winner can expect to owe even more to the IRS at tax time. And on top of that, New York will take 8.82 percent in taxes, or another $22.5 million. In other words, the winner will pay north of 45 percent in taxes altogether. However, there are strategies you can employ that reduce your taxable income, and therefore the amount you pay in taxes. For example, you can make a cash donation of up to 60 percent of your adjusted gross income and carry forward, up to five years, any excess amount. Some lottery winners set up their own charitable foundation and donate a portion of their windfall to it.",4.0

1596116,Google's capital expenditures doubled in 2018,"Google's capital spending is growing much faster than its revenue. Alphabet said in Monday's earnings report that Google's capital expenditures, which include the costs of data centers and other facilities, more than doubled in 2018, the fastest expansion in at least four years. While the vast majority of Google's revenue comes from advertising, the company has been picking up more business from cloud applications and cloud-based infrastructure, which requires data center equipment. Google also continues to hire rapidly across the globe, requiring it to buy and lease more space for people to work. Google's capital expenditures in 2018 increased 102 percent to $25.46 billion, up from a growth rate of 34 percent in 2017. In the fourth quarter, spending surged 80 percent to $6.85 billion, while revenue rose 21 percent to $39.1 billion. (Alphabet reported total sales of $39.3 billion.) Alphabet spent much more last year than rival Microsoft, which shelled out $16 billion in capital expenditures, up less than 39 percent year over year. Data center expansion is critical for Google as is builds out its cloud computing capacity. Additionally, the company bought Chelsea Market in New York and has made real estate investments since in places including Texas. ""With respect to capex [capital expenditures], we continue to invest in both compute requirements and for office facilities, although we expect the capex growth rate in 2019 to moderate quite significantly,"" Alphabet's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, told analysts on a conference call following the earnings release. Alphabet's headcount in 2018 rose 23 percent to 98,771. Porat said headcount growth will moderate in 2019.

1600086,CANADA FX DEBT-C$ tracks oil higher as investors weigh trade deal prospects,"* Canadian dollar rises 0.3 percent against the greenback * For the week, the loonie is on track to rise 0.2 percent * Price of U.S. oil rises nearly two percent * Canadian home sales rise 3.6 percent in January * Canadian bond prices fall across the yield curve TORONTO, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart on Friday, performing better than most of its peers, as oil prices rose and investors weighed prospects of a trade deal between the United States and China ahead of a March 1 deadline. U.S. stocks climbed as trade talks between the U.S. and China advanced, although worries of a cooling domestic economy kept a lid on gains. Canada is a major producer of commodities, including oil, so its economy could benefit from a U.S.-China trade deal that reduces global economic uncertainty. U.S. crude oil futures rose nearly two percent to $55.47 a barrel as this week's announcement of a higher-than-expected supply cut by Saudi Arabia encouraged investors. At 9:53 a.m. (1453 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading 0.3 percent higher at 1.3262 to the greenback, or 75.40 U.S. cents. Among G10 currencies, only the New Zealand dollar fared better. The loonie, which touched on Thursday its weakest intraday level in nearly three weeks at 1.3340, traded in a range of 1.3257 to 1.3313. For the week, the loonie is on track to gain 0.2 percent. Canadian home sales rose 3.6 percent in January from the previous month but remained below levels posted one year ago, the Canadian Real Estate Association said on Friday. Separate data, from Statistics Canada, showed that foreign investors sold a net C$18.96 billion in Canadian securities in December, led by a record divestment in bonds. This was the highest divestment since October 2007. Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The two-year fell 4 Canadian cents to yield 1.785 percent and the 10-year declined 27 Canadian cents to yield 1.908 percent. (Reporting by Fergal Smith Editing by Nick Zieminski)",3.0
1600646,"NBA stars James, Curry and Durant make more money off the court","For the fifth straight year, LeBron James is the highest-paid player in the NBA. Now in his 16th season with the league, James' earnings for the 2018-2019 season total $88.7 million, according to Forbes' list of the top 10 NBA earners. Looking at salary, bonuses and endorsement deals, Forbes found Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant to be the second and third highest-paid players in the NBA. Curry's total earnings for the season come to $79.5 million and Durant's earnings come to $65 million. These players are known for their incredible talent on the court. But it's their strategic moves outside of basketball that have really led to their financial success. In fact, James, Curry and Durant are the only three players on the highest-paid list who make more money off the court than on it. Forbes reports that 34 year-old James makes $35.7 million in salary/bonuses and an estimated $53 million in endorsement deals from partners like Nike, Coca-Cola, Beats By Dre, Blaze Pizza and 2K Sports. James' deal with Blaze is as both an investor and franchisee — he owns 14 Blaze franchises in Chicago and seven more in Florida. Beyond his basketball salary and endorsements, James is also continuing to build a solid business empire that contributes to his estimated $450 million net worth. In 2006, he launched the marketing and branding company LRMR Ventures with business partner Maverick Carter. In 2008, he launched production company SpringHill Entertainment, which created TV shows like ""The Wall"" and ""Survivor's Remorse."" In 2015, he expanded into digital media with platform Uninterrupted, which snagged a $15.8 million investment from Time Warner. And then, in 2018, James stepped outside the realm of Hollywood and sports to open up the I Promise School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. Curry, the league's second highest-paid player, earns a $37.5 million salary. Meanwhile, $42 million of his earnings comes from endorsement deals with companies like Under Amour and Chase. Most recently, the 30-year-old entered a partnership with tech company Palm and the Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten. Rakuten pays $20 million a year to have its name etched on the Warriors' jersey, and is also a sponsor of Curry's Underrated Tour. In a recent article for The Players' Tribune, Curry described the tour as ""a basketball camp, in partnership with Rakuten, for any unsigned high school players rated three stars and below."" He says that his inspiration for the tour came from the personal experience of being overlooked as a basketball prospect. In addition to his tour, Curry also launched his company SC30 last year to help him manage his investments and business ventures. In 2018, he started a production company called Unanimous Media, which signed a multi-year development deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment. Durant, who rounds out the top three, earns a $30 million salary and $35 million from endorsements. Last year, he created 35 Ventures to help consolidate his multiple business enterprises. This includes lucrative endorsement deals with companies like Nike, Alaska Airlines and Google. It also includes his media deals with Apple, ESPN and YouTube, as well as his investments in companies like Postmates, Lime and Rubrik. Recently, the 30-year-old, who has earned more than $400 million in salary and endorsements throughout his career, opened an after-school facility called College Track at The Durant Center in his hometown of Prince George's County, Maryland. The center will provide low-income and underserved students with the resources they need to reach college and to graduate. ""This is incredible, man,"" Durant told The Washington Post at the center's opening last month. ""To have this as a kind of staple and my family's name on it and it's doing so much for kids, man, it's one of the greatest accomplishments so far in my career."" In addition to James, Curry and Durant, other notable NBA players like Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Chris Paul also made the highest-paid NBA players list. In total, Forbes reports that the top 10 earners in the league make a collective $540 million from salaries, endorsements, appearances and royalties. That's a $180 million increase from the top earners five years ago.",3.0

1604757,Trump win puts U.S.-Russia hostility on hold - but for how long?,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After years of rising U.S.-Russia tensions over Ukraine, Syria, cyber attacks and nuclear arms control, Donald Trump’s election as U.S. president may offer a narrow window to repair relations as he and Russian President Vladimir Putin size up each other. But Trump’s ascent to the White House carries the risk of dangerous miscalculation if the U.S. president-elect and Putin, two willful personalities and self-styled strong leaders who have exchanged occasional compliments, decide they have misjudged one another, according to Russia experts and others. U.S. officials and private analysts predict that Putin, who has reasserted Moscow’s military and political muscle from eastern Europe to the Middle East, will avoid openly provoking Trump before he takes office. “Putin has the ability to advance his interests in many different ways. Sometimes tactical diplomacy can help,” said Fiona Hill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think-tank. “We’re in temporary truce phase,” said Hill, who has served as the U.S. national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations and co-authored a book on Putin. Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow under President Barack Obama, said Putin likely will wait to see if he can reach some accommodation with Trump to allow the lifting of Ukraine-related sanctions imposed by Washington and the European Union that have contributed to Russia’s growing economic woes. During the campaign, Trump was criticized by his Democratic Party rival, Hillary Clinton, for praising Putin as a strong leader and saying ties with Russia should be improved at a time when Moscow and Washington are at odds over Syria and Ukraine. Trump rattled Washington’s European allies with comments questioning NATO’s mutual self-defense pledge and suggesting that he might recognize Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region. Putin last year called Trump “a really brilliant and talented person” and the Kremlin said on Thursday that the U.S. president-elect’s foreign policy approach was “phenomenally close” to that of the Russian leader. Putin “has a future president who has expressed a desire to cooperate, who has expressed a desire to move away from the Obama policies. Why would you screw that up with a provocation?” asked McFaul, now at Stanford University. In Syria, a U.S. official said, Putin appears to be extending a “humanitarian” pause in air strikes against moderate rebels holding the eastern side of Aleppo to give Trump an opportunity to affirm the willingness he expressed during the campaign to seek a more cooperative U.S.-Russian relationship. “I think they were holding their fire for the purpose of decreasing the international pressure on them, and now, like the rest of the world, they may be taking stock of the current situation,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. But U.S. officials caution that Russia still may feel compelled to launch more attacks after dispatching a naval task force led by the aging aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov to the eastern Mediterranean in a show of force. The U.S. government has publicly accused Moscow of hacking the Democratic National Committee and other party organizations during the election campaign, which Russia has denied. Trump declined to blame Russia, and the Election Day Russian cyber attacks that some officials feared never materialized. Trump has not laid out a detailed Russia policy, and many in his party, including potential top advisors and cabinet officials, have taken a hawkish view of Moscow. Former House of Representatives speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally rumored for a senior post, lambasted in 2014 what he called Obama’s weak response to Russia’s land-grab in Ukraine. Putin, Gingrich wrote, is “a ruthlessly determined leader motivated by nationalism and an imperial drive.” And while there was celebration in Moscow after Trump’s victory over former secretary of state Clinton, who has been sharply critical of Putin, some Russians cautioned against euphoria. “The idea that it will be easier to strike a deal with Trump than Clinton is wrong. ... Everything will be tested when we get down to business,” analyst Vladimir Bruter told the daily pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda before Tuesday’s election. Some experts and U.S. officials say there is a high risk of miscalculation or even confrontation, given Trump’s history of taking slights and challenges personally. “That’s actually where reality is going to intrude,” Hill said. “Putin’s pretty thin-skinned, too.” Putin has a penchant for challenging adversaries, particularly when he senses weakness, and he has long made it clear that he intends to reassert what he considers Russia’s rightful global role. Suspending a treaty with Washington on cleaning up weapons-grade plutonium last month, Putin listed conditions for resuming Russian participation that amounted to a laundry list of grievances against the United States. The demands included lifting Ukraine-related U.S. economic sanctions, compensating Moscow for those sanctions and reducing the U.S. military presence in NATO’s eastern European states to the levels of 16 years ago. Russia’s bedrock concern “is whether they believe the threat of U.S.-promoted regime change is abating under a President Trump,” said Andrew Weiss, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Everything else is a secondary, lower-order problem.” Putin has accused the U.S. government of promoting widespread street protests in Russia following its 2011 elections, as well as the “color revolutions” in Georgia, Ukraine and elsewhere. On specific issues, Weiss said, there are few if any easy opportunities for rapid U.S.-Russian agreements. “The agenda’s really threadbare,” he said. “We’re basically at a standstill.” (This version of the story fixes a typo in paragraph two) Additional reporting by Andrew Osborn in Moscow.

1605777,Recession in 2019? Carlyle top chief says the world will avoid one,"There will not be a recession this year despite a slowdown in economic activity worldwide, a top executive at Carlyle Group told CNBC Wednesday. Global growth has lost some steam compared to last year, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) downgrading its forecasts for this year. At the same time, geopolitical risks have grown, from trade wars to political instability in Europe. As a result, many have started wondering whether the world economy will enter recession this year. ""I think that what we see is enough global momentum that there isn't going to be a recession in 2019,"" Kewsong Lee, co-CEO of The Carlyle Group told CNBC's Annette Weisbach. ""But I must say the way we see it, global growth is moderating but it is not stalling,"" he said. The IMF projected in January a 3.5 percent growth rate worldwide for 2019 and 3.6 percent for 2020. These were 0.2 and 0.1 percentage points below its last forecasts in October — making them the second downward revision in three months. ""The rate of growth is slower this year than it was last year at this point in time but there is enough momentum that we see us getting through 2019 without a recession. Obviously thereafter it depends a lot on what happens with policy and geopolitical events and how the corporate CEOs are thinking about investing,"" Lee said. At the time, the IMF mentioned a number of risks that could bring economic growth further down. These included Brexit, further slowdown in China, global trade tensions and high levels of government debt. ""There is a lot of volatility right now, people are uncertain exactly what the rules of the game will be, but folks are starting to pause a little bit to say where should we be spending money and how aggressively should we be investing,"" Lee added.",4.0
1607690,UPDATE 1-AT&T restructures WarnerMedia to gird for Netflix fight - memo,"(Adds background on Netflix and Disney in paragraphs 3-5, stock action) NEW YORK, March 4 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc is restructuring its WarnerMedia business, according to a memo sent to employees on Monday and seen by Reuters, as it girds for a streaming video battle with Netflix Inc and Walt Disney Co. The restructuring comes ahead of an anticipated round of significant layoffs and cost cuts and right after the resignation of two high-profile executives - Richard Plepler, the head of HBO and David Levy, president of Turner Broadcasting. AT&T, which cleared its last regulatory hurdle last week after winning an appeals court decision challenging its $85 billion deal to buy Time Warner, aims to reinvest savings into its programming businesses. It will launch an early version of its HBO-led subscription video streaming service late this year. Traditional media companies are playing catch-up to Netflix, which has built a 150-million subscriber, global direct-to-consumer video streaming service by spending heavily on Hollywood television and movie talent. Disney, which paid $71 billion to buy Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's film and television assets, is also set to launch its Disney+ streaming service by the end of 2019. AT&T shares opened down 1.2 percent at $30.44 on the New York Stock Exchange. ""At a time when we must shift our investment focus to develop more content for specific and demanding audiences on emerging platforms, we can't sustain a model where we invest one dollar more than necessary in the administrative aspects of running our business,"" WarnerMedia Chief Executive Officer John Stankey said in the memo. ""Put simply, our priority is to direct resources to product development and innovation."" Robert Greenblatt, a former executive at Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal unit, will oversee premium cable network HBO, cable channels TNT, TBS, Tru TV and the upcoming video streaming service as chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment. CNN chief Jeff Zucker will add oversight of sports programming across the company as chairman of News and Sports. Kevin Tsujihara will continue to run Warner Bros Hollywood and TV studios and add two new businesses to his responsibilities, including a newly created kids and young adult group. The overhaul will bring together kids programming from across the company, including storied franchises Hanna-Barbera and Loony Tunes. Tsujihara will also oversee the licensed consumer products business across the company. WarnerMedia has also consolidated advertising sales and affiliate sales under one division to be run by Gerhard Zeiler, newly appointed chief revenue officer. Zeiler was president of Turner International. (Reporting by Kenneth Li; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)",3.5

The new fund, named the SoftBank Innovation Fund, will be run by former Sprint CEO and Bolivian native Marcelo Claure. SoftBank has already committed $2 billion to the fund, though no decision has been made yet on where its headquarters will be. The fund's size is unprecedented in Latin America as it totals the combined venture capital investments of 2017 and 2018, according to Venturesource data cited by The Wall Street Journal. ""Latin America is on the cusp of becoming one of the most important economic regions in the world, and we anticipate significant growth in the decades ahead,"" said Masayoshi Son, chairman and CEO of SoftBank, in a statement.

1612506,US oil settles 2.4% higher at $58.26 a barrel on declining crude stockpiles,"Oil prices rose on Wednesday, buoyed by a large U.S. inventories drawdown and as sanctions stall exports from Venezuela. International Brent crude oil futures were at $67.63 a barrel, up 98 cents, or 1.47 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at $58.37 per barrel, up $1.50, or 2.64 percent — building on their strong gains from earlier in the day. The Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that U.S. crude inventories fell by 3.9 million barrels last week. The data came after the American Petroleum Institute also said Tuesday that U.S. crude stocks had fallen in the previous week. Oil prices have been pushed up this year by supply cuts led by the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Sunday that the production-curbing agreement would likely last until at least June. Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, indicated on Monday that it would cut April exports. Markets have been further tightened by U.S. sanctions against oil exports from OPEC members Iran and Venezuela. Venezuela's worst blackout on record has left most of the country without power for six days, with hospitals struggling to keep equipment running, food rotting in the tropical heat and exports from the country's main oil terminal stranded. ""Failures in the electrical system ... (are) likely to accelerate the loss of 700,000 barrels per day"" in oil supply, Barclays bank said. National Australia Bank reported a mixed outlook for oil, with global economic concerns and strong oil supply growth from the United States keeping prices in check but OPEC supply cuts and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela driving them up.",3.5
1612952,"Beto O'Rourke on 2020 run: 'Man, I'm just born to be in it'","Former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke is ""just born to be in"" the 2020 presidential race, he told Vanity Fair in a report released Wednesday. ""You can probably tell that I want to run,"" he said. ""I do. I think I'd be good at it."" The interview comes after CNBC reported that O'Rourke has started engaging with potential campaign managers in case he decides to run for President in 2020. Both sides of the aisle have been waiting to see if O'Rourke will decide to join the race. The move by O'Rourke to start holding conversations with those he considers strong candidates to lead his 2020 operation comes after he reportedly has decided to not pursue a bid for Sen. John Cornyn's seat. In a recent Dallas Morning News report, O'Rourke said he has made a decision about his future but wouldn't elaborate further. ""Amy and I have made a decision about how we can best serve our country,"" he told The Dallas Morning News. ""We are excited to share it with everyone soon."" O'Rourke and his wife Amy both spoke with Vanity Fair from their home in El Paso, Texas. They described what they believe is the former congressman's innate political ability. ""There is something abnormal, super-normal, that we both experience when we're out on the campaign trail,"" O'Rourke said. Although O'Rourke feels ""magic"" on the campaign trail, he was defeated by Senator Ted Cruz in the 2018 midterm election. He said he thought he had won until the very last moment. ""So many of the stories that we had heard, especially in the weeks leading up to the election, you're like, How can you not win when there is that level of just dedication and passion from so many people that we had met?"" he said. If O'Rourke does get into the race, one of his defining issues in a crowded field of competitors might be immigration. He recently led a counter-protest when President Donald Trump held a rally in El Paso to drum up support for his border wall. Beto has advocated for a path to citizenship for young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children, ending the War on Drugs, and working with the Mexican government to track illegal immigrants. O'Rourke is headed to Iowa this weekend, fueling speculation that he will soon officially enter the packed Democratic primary race. Read the full Vanity Fair report",3.0

The remarks by Hocine Kheldoun to Ennahar television late on Thursday are another major blow to Bouteflika, who hoped to pacify Algerians by promising to take steps to change the political landscape which has been dominated by the president and the ruling elite for decades. FLN holds the majority in all elected assemblies, including parliament and local city councils. Tens of thousands of Algerians have staged protests for weeks demanding a new era with younger leaders who would offer greater social freedoms and a healthy economy. Bouteflika, 82, has rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 2013. He has lost one ally after another in recent weeks as he clings to power. A former minister who is familiar with Bouteflika's inner circle told Reuters that the president could not survive given the pressure that has been building against him from Algerians of all social classes. Game over. Bouteflika has no choice but to quit now, "" he said. Many Algerians complain that the ailing president and other veterans of the 1954-1962 war of independence against France must hand over power to young technocrats who can focus on unemployment, poor services and stamping out corruption.

1615005,Poland moves to block EU changes on seconded workers: sources,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Warsaw is strongly opposed to changes put forward by the European Union’s executive to equalize pay between seconded and local workers and hopes to block them together with other poorer countries in the bloc, Polish diplomatic sources said. Seconded or “posted” workers, employed in one EU state but temporarily sent to work in another, make up less than 1 percent of all employment in the 28-nation bloc. But their number has jumped in recent years: There were some 1.9 million posted workers in the EU in 2014, the most recent data shows. Employers are now not obliged to pay posted workers more than the minimum wage in the host country, which leads to underpayment of posted workers on the one hand but also to unfair competition between firms employing seconded or local workers. The European Commission in March proposed equalizing the pay of the two categories, saying that would protect workers’ rights and ensure fairer competition. The construction sector accounts for nearly half of all posted workers, and the practice is also popular in the manufacturing industry and personal and business services. While the current system puts the better-off EU states at a disadvantage, low-wage countries in eastern and southern Europe benefit from it. The two camps are now set to lock horns over the outlined changes. “This is a very, very bad proposal, an extreme change. It’s entirely political but would have far-reaching consequences in the real economy, right up to ending seconding workers with the bloc altogether in the worst-case scenario,” a Polish diplomat said. “We are aiming to block it.” The diplomat said Warsaw was seeking to put together a coalition opposing the Commission’s proposal and that the group would also consist of Slovakia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Romania, Bulgaria and Cyprus. Another Polish diplomatic source confirmed Warsaw was trying to build a blocking group. Reporting by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Hugh Lawson",4.0
1616374,Two GOP bills seek to redirect funds from California bullet train project,"Two House bills introduced this month by Republicans from California seek to redirect federal funds from the state's high-speed rail project and use the money for other purposes. The Trump administration in February demanded funds back from the controversial project, which has been plagued by cost overruns and delays. A bill introduced by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy would ""repurpose"" about $3.5 billion worth of federal funds for the rail system to water infrastructure projects to help the state cope with future droughts. A second piece of legislation, dubbed the ""High-Speed Refund Act"" and introduced by Rep. Doug LaMalfa, requires that any funds the Transportation Department provided to the high-speed rail development go instead to ""important freight and highway projects."" ""The California high-speed rail project is a boondoggle that California and American taxpayers must move on from,"" McCarthy said earlier this month. ""Since its inception, the project's costs have ballooned while oversight and accountability within the California High-Speed Rail Authority has been nonexistent."" Last month, Gov. Gavin Newsom during his State of the State address said construction of the planned high-speed rail from the San Francisco Bay Area to Los Angeles will ""cost too much and take too long."" Yet Newsom in the Feb. 12 remarks stopped short of calling for a full halt of the massive project, saying: ""I am not interested in sending $3.5 billion in federal funding that was allocated to this project back to Donald Trump."" The governor ordered ""new transparency measures"" on the rail project and approved going ahead with part of the rail link — a 119-mile stretch in the Central Valley between Merced and Bakersfield. Wasting little time, President Donald Trump weighed in on Newsom's reduction of the high-speed rail project in a tweet Feb. 13: ""We want that money back now,"" the president wrote, calling the planned bullet train ""a 'green' disaster!"" The Trump administration formally notified the state last month that the Federal Railway Administration is seeking return of $2.5 billion in funds for what it termed ""this now-defunct project."" The U.S. government also announced it intends to terminate the grant of another $929 million in funding, claiming the state's high-speed rail agency failed to stay in compliance under terms of the Obama-era grant agreement. Earlier this month, California sent a letter to FRA and rebutted the federal government's assertion that the state was out of compliance. ""We have not heard back from the federal government yet,"" Melissa Figueroa, a spokesperson for the California State Transportation Agency, told CNBC on Thursday. An FRA spokesperson, who didn't wish to be identified, said Thursday via email the federal agency was still reviewing the state's position on the matter but had no further comment. A group of mostly California Democratic members of Congress sent a letter Wednesday to U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao urging her to ""work constructively with the state to identify and remedy"" concerns it may have about the performance of the state's high-speed rail agency. ""Cancelling the Department's commitment to fulfill the outstanding legal obligations and attempting to claw back funding already lawfully spent would be unjustified and harmful,"" the letter stated. Meantime, Figueroa said California is moving forward to get environmental clearance of the entire project from San Francisco to Southern California. To date, the state has dispatched nearly 2,700 workers to construction sites for the rail system and has more than 20 active construction sites, according to state officials. The 2018 business plan projecting the baseline cost of the nearly 520-mile rail system soared 20 percent from two years earlier and indicated the cost could rise to nearly $100 billion. A decade ago, California voters approved a ballot measure authorizing nearly $10 billion in bond money for the construction of the high-speed rail system. The original cost of the project in 2008 was estimated at $33 billion. A project update report is due out in early May and is expected to provide more information on the high-speed rail's funding situation. The state has already spent roughly $5.2 billion, including the $2.5 billion in federal funds received during the Obama administration. ""We're making progress,"" insisted Figueroa. She said there is ""dedicated funding for the project"" and funds to complete the Bakersfield-to-Merced section will be discussed in the May report.",3.5

1625396,Trump says he will have to send more troops to the US-Mexico border,"President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he will have to direct more American troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, after his supporters shared graphic stories about illegal immigration during a meeting in San Antonio. ""I'm going to have to call up more military,"" said Trump, who was flanked at the roundtable event by a small group of local officials and ranchers. Trump has sent thousands of troops to the border before. In early February, the Pentagon announced a deployment of about 3,750 active-duty troops less than two weeks before the president declared that the situation at the southern border constituted a national emergency. Trump also lashed out at media outlets who have refused to count the construction of replacement barrier along the border as ""new"" sections of his long-promised wall. ""I ripped down a wall"" that was ""useless, and we built a new one,"" Trump said. ""Some of them said we didn't build a wall ... what they don't say is that we ripped it down"" because ""it was garbage."" Trump told the reporters, ""You're dishonest people, many of you."" The roundtable was part of two scheduled fundraising events in Texas — one in San Antonio and the other in Houston. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told reporters earlier Wednesday that she expected Trump's reelection campaign would raise at least $6 million from the two events alone. Trump did not elaborate on when he would send more military personnel to the border, or how many he planned to deploy. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's questions about the president's remarks. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Trump relayed to the media some of the anecdotes he had been told about the danger on the border. ""We start talking and the first person gets up and says, 'Sir, we have many people dying. Coming across the border,'"" Trump said. ""'They'll be dropped off and they start walking and they'll say Houston's right down the road. But it's actually 300 miles away. And we find dead people from Guatemala, from Honduras, from El Salvador, From Mexico. All over.'"" The president also said that the troops sent to the border have to use more restraint than they otherwise would. ""Our military, don't forget, can't act like a military would act. Because if they got a little rough, everybody would go crazy,"" Trump said. ""They have all these horrible laws that the Democrats won't change, they will not change them. And I think they will pay a very big price in 2020 for all of the things, whether it is the fake witch hunt they start out, or whether it is a situation like this.

Brent crude oil futures were at $71.46 a barrel at 0233 GMT, down 9 cents, or 0.1 percent, from their last close, having hit their highest since Nov. 12 on Friday at $71.87. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $63.63 per barrel, down 26 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last settlement. ""I would expect oil to trade in a relatively tight band around $70 per for the time being,"" said Virendra Chauhan, oil analyst at Energy Aspects in Singapore, pointing to mixed signals on supply from the United States and OPEC and its allies. The head of Libya's National Oil Corp warned on Friday that renewed fighting could wipe out crude production in the country. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies meet in June to decide whether to continue withholding supply. OPEC, Russia and other producers, are reducing output by 1.2 million bpd from Jan. 1 for six months. ""Leading edge indicators on U.S. supply suggest activity levels are stepping up which is supportive for strong production growth in the second half,"" said Chauhan But at the same time, ""murmurings from various ministers of the OPEC+ pact suggest supply from the group will not be ramped up pre-emptively as per last summer,"" he said. OPEC's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, is considered keen to keep cutting, but sources within the group said it could raise output from July if disruptions continue elsewhere. Russia's Finance Minister Anton Siluanov was quoted by the TASS news agency as saying on Saturday that Russia and OPEC may decide to boost production to fight for market share with the United States but this would push oil prices as low as $40 per barrel. U.S. energy companies last week increased the number of oil rigs operating for a second week in a row, bringing the total count to 833, General Electric Co's Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. The rig count fell for the past four months as independent exploration and production companies cut spending on new drilling to focus on earnings growth instead of increased output.

Terry Gou, speaking on the sidelines of an event in Taipei, said that while he planned to resign as chairman, he hoped to remain involved in strategic decisions regarding the company's business. When asked by Reuters if he would quit as chairman, Gou said he was moving in that direction, although any decision needed to be discussed with the company's board. ""I dont know where you got the information from. But I have to say, basically, I'm working towards that direction - to walk back to the second line, or retire ... I have been busy for 45 years.

""The market is over-discounting the possibility of Fed cut this year."" According to Leduc, the sentiment is reflected in how certain assets have been trading. ""Fixed-income investors should be improving the quality of their portfolios,"" he said. ""Risk assets, ... as well as corporate bond assets have performed very strongly this year. Part of that performance in our opinion has been based on this expectation that the Fed may cut rates and keep monetary policy very, very accommodative. "" Leduc does not believe the Federal Reserve will make a move this year because of a stronger economic picture and he expects inflation to creep higher.

Leduc, who oversees $135 billion in bond portfolios, is focusing on shorter-term duration bonds. He suggests it's a strategy that should be universal in this environment.

1638134,Ex-JC Penney CEO: Trade deal needed by end of year or retail in trouble,"The U.S. needs to work out a trade deal with China by the end of the year or the retail sector will be in big trouble, former J.C. Penney CEO Allen Questrom said Thursday. Questrom, who served as chairman and CEO at the department store chain from September 2000 to December 2004, said he expects President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will come to an agreement soon because ""nobody benefits the longer this goes on"" and they ""don't want to see a disaster."" ""If the tariffs don't get solved this year then you've got a real problem,"" Questrom told CNBC's Brian Sullivan in an interview on ""Fast Money. "" ""We've got two intelligence economies: One China, one United States,"" he said. ""And I think they're going to come to their senses."" The SPDR S&P Retail XRT — an ETF that tracks the industry's biggest companies — is down 1.73% year to date through Thursday's close amid the U.S.-China trade dispute. The world's two largest economies increased tariffs on one another this month, with the U.S. making the first move by increasing duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese products from 10% to 25%. China announced plans to raise tariff rates on $60 billion in U.S. goods. The tactics amplified a fight that has rattled financial markets and threatened to drag on the global economy. During post-earnings conference calls this week, Kohl's, J.C. Penney and Home Depot executives were united in their messaging against additional taxes on imports from China. Kohl's cut its earnings estimates, blaming in part a hit from tariffs. But Questrom said retail stocks Target, Walmart and Costco will be winners in the near term because of their exposure in the grocery business. Meanwhile, department store chains will need to ""execute well"" and create ""excitement"" for their consumers in order to bring in revenue and satisfy investors.",5.0
1645947,"WRAPUP 2-China, U.S. to resume trade talks but China says demands must be met","(Adds comments from Apple, U.S. tariff hearings, Xi in North Korea) * Top Chinese, U.S. officials to resume talks - Chinese ministry * China's fundamental demands must be met - ministry * U.S. must stop threatening tariffs, waging trade war - ministry BEIJING, June 20 (Reuters) - China said on Thursday it hoped U.S. officials would bring a problem-solving attitude to renewed trade talks in advance of a meeting between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping next week in Japan. Negotiations to reach a broad trade deal broke down last month after U.S. officials accused China of backing away from previously agreed commitments. A telephone call between Trump and Xi on Tuesday, as well as confirmation the two will meet in Japan on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit, have rekindled hopes of a detente. ""The heads of the two trade teams will communicate, according to instructions passed down from the two presidents,"" Chinese commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng told reporters. ""We hope (the United States) will create the necessary conditions and atmosphere for solving problems through dialogue as equals."" U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday he would speak by telephone to Liu He, China's vice premier and chief negotiator in the trade talks, ""in the next day and a half."" The two countries have imposed tariffs on each other's imports, disrupting global supply chains and roiling financial markets. China has vowed to not give in to U.S. pressure on issues of principle. Trump has threatened to extend tariffs to another $300 billion worth of goods, covering nearly all remaining Chinese imports into the United States, including consumer products such as cellphones, computers and clothing. China says three main sticking points remain between the two sides in trade negotiations. They are the removal of tariffs imposed in the trade war, the scale of goods purchases from the United States that China will make to help reduce the trade imbalance between the two, and the need for a ""balanced"" text for any trade deal. Those ""matters of principle"" cannot be compromised, China has said. However, Gao still expressed optimism about the possibility of agreement on issues such as structural economic reform, implementation, protection of intellectual property (IP) rights and market opening. ""Both sides have immense mutual interests. I believe by taking care of each other's concerns through equal dialogue, both sides will for sure be able to find a solution to solve the problems properly,"" Gao said. U.S. BUSINESS The U.S. Trade Representative on Thursday was holding the fourth of seven days of hearings for manufacturers, retailers and other U.S. businesses to comment on the proposed tariffs. Individuals and firms can also submit comments to an online government docket. Apple Inc weighed in with a comment filed online on Thursday that the proposed tariffs on goods including iPhones, iPads, and Macs will hurt its global competitiveness. The company also noted that tariffs would reduce its contribution to the U.S. Treasury. The company is the largest U.S. corporate taxpayer and pledged in 2018 to directly contribute over $350 billion to the U.S. economy over five years. The Trump administration has accused China of failing to protect IP, forcing U.S. companies to transfer technology to Chinese partners, and failing to provide a level playing field for U.S. companies. China has repeatedly promised to open its market wider to foreign investors and provide them with better services and treatment. Speaking to a group of 19 chief executives of foreign multinationals in Beijing on Thursday, Premier Li Keqiang reiterated those promises. ""China will maintain our long-standing commitment to reform and opening in order to continue to expand and open. We welcome more and more foreign investment to come to China,"" Li said, in comments in front of reporters. ""We will also relax (restrictions on) access to even more fields to create a market-oriented, law-based internationalised business environment."" LOSE-LOSE Neither side has signaled it would shift from positions that led to the impasse last month, when Beijing revised a draft of the trade deal, removing references to changes in Chinese law. While talks between Xi and Trump in Japan were unlikely to resolve major disagreements immediately, they could start a new phase in negotiations, Chinese state media said on Thursday. The official China Daily said in an editorial both parties were ""in the mood for serious dialogue"" as a full-blown trade war was ""lose-lose"", but one single meeting was unlikely to wrap everything up. ""More likely than not, the one-on-one meeting will end up being the start of a new phase in the negotiations with the two leaders personally setting out their country's respective bottom lines,"" it said. China has managed to get the United States back to the table with its determination and ability to ""prepare for war"", Taoran Notes, a widely read and influential WeChat account run by the Economic Daily, wrote late on Wednesday. ""Only by being able to fight, daring to fight and being good at fighting can you stop a war,"" it wrote. President Xi was in North Korea on Thursday on a two-day trip, the first by a Chinese leader in 14 years, re-asserting a key leverage point China has as Pyongyang's only major ally. Denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula is one of Trump's foreign policy priorities, but Pyongyang has resumed some weapons tests since a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un collapsed in Hanoi earlier this year. ""The international community hopes that North Korea and the United States can talk and for the talks to get results,"" Chinese state TV paraphrased Xi as telling Kim.

1647657,What 2020 long-shot Williamson's candidacy says about politics in age of Trump,"Six Democratic women are running for president, five of them are career politicians, including four senators and a congresswoman. And then there's Marianne Williamson. The 66-year-old self-help guru doesn't have policy chops of Sen. Elizabeth Warren. She doesn't share the prosecutorial skills of Sens. Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar. She doesn't enjoy the funding network of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. And she hasn't served in the military like Iraq veteran and U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. But the best-selling author and motivational speaker has clinched one of 20 coveted spots at the upcoming debates by getting to 1% in at least three national polls and receiving 65,000 unique donations — the criteria set by the Democratic National Committee. She landed that spot well ahead of Gillibrand, who came dangerously close to missing the cut. Three other politicians — Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton and Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam — did not make the cut. Williamson, in a recent interview, chalked up her unexpected success to a new ""openness to ideas"" among voters. Some of her ideas can be unconventional. The Texas native wants to bring a ""moral and spiritual awakening"" to American politics. She says the country's political system has lost its heart and needs to find it. She wants to create a Department of Peace. ""Millions of Americans feel the country has swerved from its moral center,"" she said, citing the separation of children from parents at the southern border. ""That's a spiritual malfunction, a transgression against the values we hold dear."" Though her comments are aimed at the Trump administration's policies, she prefers not to put too much focus on the man she wants to face in November 2020. ""I don't feel the American people need me to tell them who Donald Trump is or what he stands for,"" she said. ""My job is to present an alternative that is a far more compelling and genuinely American way of looking at our country and the world."" The debate will be a political coming out party for the candidate who has little experience in the arena beyond a 2014 California U.S. House primary race that she lost. Though she has written 14 books and has 2.6 million Twitter followers, an April poll conducted by Change Research noted that 66% of likely Democratic voters had never heard of her. On Thursday, she'll appear on a stage packed with 2020 front-runners including Harris, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor and rising star Pete Buttigieg. Doug Sosnik, a former senior advisor to President Bill Clinton, said Williamson's elevation to the debate stage ""says more about the state of American politics than it does about her candidacy."" In the age of Trump, he suggested, everyone seems to think they deserve a shot at running the country. But Sosnik warned, ""This is a long haul. You've got to be able to stand out over time and take the scrutiny."" Appearing on Night 2 with the more star-studded group of candidates could be a double-edged sword for Williamson, who reached the pinnacle of her celebrity in the 1990s when Oprah Winfrey took her under her wing. More viewers may tune in, but she's likely to get less speaking time. ""Williamson will get a couple of minutes to make her case to voters,"" said Chris Lu, a former Obama White House Cabinet secretary and DNC superdelegate. ""If she can use it to push forward a specific policy agenda that would be an accomplishment."" She is confident she can hold her own. ""I'm going to speak my truth, and they're going to speak theirs,"" Williamson said. She's skilled at staying on message. At a recent MSNBC event her voice rang out as if she was preaching a Sunday sermon as she answered questions about poverty and racial injustice. She made the case for reparations for African Americans who are descendants of slaves, a hot topic on the campaign trail and one she's been a proponent of for years. Like other progressive Democrats, she's for a Green New Deal to fight climate change and supports ""Medicare for All."" She wants to tax the wealthy to pay for such programs. She also backs abortion rights and gun control. She's for ""capitalism with a conscience."" But she stands apart when she talks about bringing spirituality into politics. ""My campaign is about an integrative approach to politics that factors in psychological and emotional issues,"" she said. Williamson, who is Jewish, said people are ready for that conversation. She moved from New York to Iowa several months ago so she could be central to early voting states like New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. She has been hitting the road to spread her message. It's resonating, according to Paula Roby, a 45-year-old attorney, Cedar Rapids native, campaign volunteer and long-time fan. ""I was looking for an antidote to all of the hate and fear and lies coming from Washington right now,"" she said. ""Her ideas are exactly what I want to see in a candidate."" She said Williamson may not have the experience of more seasoned candidates, but she's not a novice. Many of her positions are outlined in a book she wrote two decades ago, ""Healing the Soul of America: Reclaiming our Voices as Spiritual Citizens."" Despite her distinctive voice, Williamson is clearly an underdog. She raised just $1.5 million in the first quarter, according to a Federal Elections Commission filing, far below leading Democrats. She does not plan to kick in her own money. A personal finance disclosure from 2013 shows she had assets of just under $1 million to $4.5 million, not including private residences. She said she would have more if ""I had been smarter in the 1990s"" and made better investments. Williamson stepped on a landmine Wednesday over whether vaccines should be mandated in the face of a growing nationwide measles epidemic. She said the idea was ""draconian"" and ""Orwellian,"" raising concern she is sympathetic to the anti-vaccine movement. She later walked back those comments but maintained that ""public safety must be carefully balanced with the right of individuals to make their own decisions."" That position did not go over well with hosts of ""The View,"" who grilled her on the subject when she joined them on Thursday. And though she got that coveted debate spot, she's still just at 1% or less in recent polls, including in Iowa, her adopted home state. She's depending on the debate to raise awareness that will spur more campaign donations that will enable her to stay in the race. Even so, one thing you probably won't see Williamson doing is attacking her rivals on the debate stage. When asked if she was disappointed that two white men in their 70s, Biden and Sanders, were leading the field despite the presence of six women, she took umbrage — at the question. ""I don't want to participate in ageism or prejudice of any kind,"" she said. ""As a woman, I know what it feels like when people automatically dismiss you for your sex. I don't want to do to a man what men have done to me. I think in the final analysis, what matters most is not their age or sex, but their consciousness, their ideas, their plans, their courage and their commitment.""",4.0
1653927,IMF urges Yemen government to pay public sector wages across country,"DUBAI, July 19 (Reuters) - The IMF urged Yemen's internationally recognised government on Friday to extend its payments of public sector salaries to the whole country to help the war-shattered economy to recover. The IMF also praised the government, which is based in the southern port of Aden after being ousted from the capital Sanaa by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement, for already making some payments to workers and paying all pensions in areas of Yemen outside its own control. The United Nations has described the situation in Yemen as the world's worst humanitarian crisis, after four years of conflict between the Houthis and the Saudi-backed government forces, in which tens of thousands of people have been killed. ""We urge the government to pay all civil service salaries throughout the country,"" the International Monetary Fund said in a statement after a mission visited Yemen on July 10-18 for the first time since December. The war caused runaway inflation and restricted the flow of goods into and around Yemen, pushing millions into hunger and joblessness and crippling public services such as health and education. The Houthis control the main population centres including Sanaa. The conflict has also split the central bank into two - one based in Aden under government control and one in Sanaa under Houthi control - hindering public sector salary payments and imports. But the government began paying salaries and pensions to Yemenis at least in some Houthi-controlled areas early this year and the IMF urged it to continue this practice and extend the payments to all parts of the country. In its statement, the IMF said economic growth had ""moved back into positive territory, albeit now from a much lower per capita income level"" after sharp declines in 2014-17. ""Donor financing and increased hydrocarbon receipts were key factors in quelling last year's dramatic volatility in the exchange rate and food prices, and basic food imports increased toward prewar levels, supported also by humanitarian aid,"" it said. The IMF also called for further donor financing, spending restraint by the government and improved revenue collection. (Reporting by Lisa Barrington Editing by Gareth Jones)",3.0
1654519,France's parliament approves EU-Canada deal with small majority,"PARIS, July 23 (Reuters) - France's parliament approved on Tuesday the EU-Canada trade agreement with a relatively small majority, meaning that a significant part of President Emmanuel Macron's party voted against it. French lawmakers at the National Assembly, the country's lower house of parliament, cast 266 votes in favor, 213 against and 74 abstentions. Macron's LREM party and its centrist ally Modem together have 349 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly. A parliament tally showed that 229 LREM members voted in favor of the controversial treaty, 9 against and 52 abstained. At Modem, 32 voted in favor, 2 against and 6 abstained. All leftist and far-right parties voted against the agreement, but among the conservative Les Republicains, one lawmaker voted in favor of the treaty and five abstained. Ahead of the vote, popular former environment minister Nicolas Hulot, NGOs and green lawmakers had urged parliament to vote against the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). They said the treaty undermines the European Union's social and ecological regulations by importing products made under conditions that would not be allowed in Europe. France is the 14th EU country to approve CETA, which provisionally took effect from September 2017, but still needs to be approved by all 28 EU member states. The French Senate will vote on it in the autumn too but does not have the power to block it. (Reporting by Simon Carraud Writing by Geert De Clercq Editing by Mathieu Rosemain)",5.0
1656629,Gen. John Hyten denies sexual assault allegations at Senate hearing,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's nominee to become the second-highest-ranking U.S. military officer denied sexual assault allegations against him at his Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday. ""Nothing happened, ever,"" Air Force Gen. John Hyten, the outgoing head of the U.S. military's Strategic Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee. Earlier this year, then-Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson announced that Hyten, America's top nuclear commander, would become the next vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The denial by Hyten came on the heels of a U.S. Air Force investigation into sexual assault claims made against him by U.S. Army Col. Kathryn Spletstoser, who was formerly under Hyten's command. She sat behind him during his testimony on Tuesday. ""I was just devastated as a human being, and it was scary, and it was a horrible position to be in,"" Spletstoser said of the alleged assault to reporters after the hearing. She alleges that Hyten engaged in unwanted kissing, touching and rubbing up against her. The Air Force Office of Special Investigations did not find sufficient evidence to charge Hyten in the matter. The latest revelation comes as the Pentagon deals with 6,053 reports in 2018 of sexual assault. Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., the first female combat pilot in the U.S. Air Force, defended Hyten during his testimony on Tuesday. ""Sexual assault happens in the military. It just didn't happen in this case,"" she said. Earlier this year, McSally disclosed in a hearing that she was raped by a superior officer while serving in the Air Force. ""The truth is that General Hyten is innocent of these charges,"" McSally said, adding that she hoped Spletstoser ""gets the help she needs."" Wilson, who was Air Force secretary until she stepped down in May, introduced and endorsed Hyten at the hearing. ""This matter should be set aside as you consider his nomination,"" she said, adding that he had been falsely accused. Lawmakers could hold a vote on Hyten's nomination before the Senate leaves for August recess.",4.5
1660767,"Cousins has 41 and 23 in Sacramento return, Pelicans rally","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- DeMarcus Cousins could exhale at last. The nerves were long gone, his highly anticipated return to Sacramento in the books -- and what a beauty it was. Cousins immediately scored after winning the opening tip and never stopped on the way to 41 points and 23 rebounds, and the emotional big man dominated his old team to rally the New Orleans Pelicans past the Kings 114-106 on Thursday night. Cousins took the crowd at Golden 1 Center on a trip down memory lane, then left them with some heartache after a spectacular performance. He waved to his supportive former home fans as highlights showed of his time in California&aposs capital. ""It was pretty emotional,"" Cousins said. ""I was super nervous coming in. The anticipation was like through the roof. I really couldn&apost wait for the ball to go up and we could just actually get to the basketball part."" He hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 2:21 to play for a 108-106 lead and the Pelicans held on -- and Cousins finally got some help in a second-half comeback after New Orleans trailed by 14 at intermission playing without injured star Anthony Davis. Jameer Nelson contributed 18 points with four 3-pointers with Davis sidelined with a left knee injury sustained at Portland on Tuesday. The Pelicans were down 70-56 at halftime with Cousins largely a one-man show already with 20 points, nine rebounds and five assists. Rookie De&aposAaron Fox scored 14 points off the bench to lead seven Kings in double figures. Cousins received overwhelming support and love with a standing ovation during pregame introductions with a few boos. After his initial basket, the Kings answered with a 17-2 run. A video and highlight tribute to Cousins played on the scoreboard during a first-quarter timeout as he was formally welcomed back to the city where he played seven seasons, and the big man gave a big wave. ""I loved it,"" Cousins said. ""I&aposve got nothing but love for this city. I came here as a kid and left as a man. As I stated many times, I&aposve got people here I consider family. These fans have been great to me throughout the years."" ""BOOGIE THANK YOU, LOVE YOU, MISS YOU"" read one sign held by a female fan in Golden 1 Center. ""Very talented dude,"" Kings coach Dave Joerger said. Cousins, who was fined $25,000 last week for cursing at a Grizzlies fan in Memphis, shot 14 for 25, dished out six assists and kept his emotions in check. At the 9:23 mark of the first quarter, Cousins and Willie Cauley-Stein were tied up under the basket. Cousins then carried the ball out of the crowd and set it down in front of the New Orleans bench before the jump ball. ""This was just as big a game for them as it was for us,"" Cousins said. ""We knew they would be juiced. We knew they would come out swinging and that&aposs exactly what they did."" He had faced the Kings once already since his February trade, in New Orleans on March 31, and scored 37 points while making 12 of 21 shots in the Pelicans&apos 117-89 victory. ""For him, he came here as a young kid, really. He&aposd been with this franchise the entire time,"" coach Alvin Gentry said. ""You have friends in the city, you have things that you&aposve done just from a community service point of view that you had. And then very emotional when he left here. I was there when he got on the plane. I think people don&apost realize, they look at these guys as something other than a 22- 25- 27-year-old kid, and that&aposs what they are. I don&apost care how big they are, they&aposve got the same emotions as everyone else has. ""It&aposs tough, because it wasn&apost his decision to leave.

1676363,NYC releases documents connected to Central Park 5 case,"NEW YORK –  A lawyer for five men wrongly convicted in the vicious 1989 rape of a Central Park jogger said Friday that the release of investigative records leaves them ""reliving the horror"" of their experiences. ""The stigma that they were these horrible animals engaged in wilding has followed them through their life,"" said Jonathan Moore, one of several attorneys who secured a $41 million settlement in 2014 on their behalf. Moore said he&aposd spoken Friday with the men after the city released thousands of pages of investigative documents Thursday ranging from witness interviews to scraps of scribbled notes. ""For them, it&aposs more reliving the horror of what they experienced rather than being happy it all came out,"" he said. ""They get emotional about what happened and are affected to this day but they don&apost do it with bitterness and hate."" Nearly all the documents were part of the court record or were shared with lawyers who prepared a defense for the black and Hispanic teenagers who became known as the Central Park Five. They served six to 13 years in prison before the convictions were thrown out in 2002 after evidence linked Matias Reyes, a murderer and serial rapist, to the attack. The victim, who is white, was found with over 75 percent of her blood drained from her body and her skull smashed. She was in a coma for 12 days, suffered permanent damage and remembered nothing about the attack. At the time, she was a 28-year-old investment banker who ran regularly in Central Park. The attack occurred as the city was reaching a peak of 2,000 annual murders. Reports that youths were roaming the park and attacking people gave rise to the term ""wilding"" for urban mayhem by marauding teenagers. The jogger, Trisha Meili, told the New York Daily News she was eager to see the documents because they contain information she never had access to. The Associated Press does not usually identify victims of sexual assault, but Meili went public as a motivational speaker and wrote a book. Moore said the release of documents won&apost contain revelations ""to change anyone&aposs opinions about what happened."" ""There&aposs no smoking gun there that&aposs going to say these kids are actually guilty and didn&apost deserve a penny,"" he said. ""We don&apost even learn more about the conduct of the cops."" Of the Central Park Five, only one lives in the New York area anymore, Moore said. Three live near one another. Most are raising children. Some work, including speaking engagements. ""Notwithstanding that they got some money, they have never recovered from the emotional trauma,"" the lawyer said. Asked to comment on the document release, a city law office spokesman declined. In a website introduction, the city said records include much of the over 200,000 pages and 95 witness interviews exchanged between attorneys during the civil case. It also noted that in reaching the $41 million settlement, ""the city and the individual civil defendants have denied that the convictions of the five civil plaintiffs resulted from any wrongful or otherwise unlawful acts.""",4.0
1679981,Crews battle growing wildfire near homes in California,"LAKE ELSINORE, Calif. –  Firefighters fought to spare homes Friday from a growing Southern California forest fire, a day after flames came perilously close to neighborhoods and destroyed one house. Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for Orange and Riverside counties as the fire carved its way along ridges in Cleveland National Forest south of Los Angeles. Some hillsides were allowed to burn under the watchful eyes of firefighters as a way to reduce fuel and make it harder for flames to jump roadways into communities if winds pick up again. Aircraft dropped fire retardant on flames and homes as people ignoring evacuation orders used garden hoses to spray down their properties when the blaze flared Thursday evening, propelled by 20-mph (30-kph) gusts. Shannon Hicks, 59, defied an evacuation order and watched in awe as firefighters faced down a storm of flames that descended toward her street in the city of Lake Elsinore. ""It looked like a tornado. The flames were just twirling and twirling,"" she said. ""I thought, &aposThere&aposs no way they&aposre saving my house.&apos But somehow they did."" One resident wasn&apost so lucky. Standing in the ashes of his burned home on Friday, Dan Pritchett told KNBC-TV that he and his brother stayed until a wall of flames roared near. ""I turned to him and said, &aposLet&aposs go,&apos"" Pritchett said. ""(There were) 100-foot flames right on the crest of the hill, right in front of me."" Along with Pritchett&aposs home, the Holy Fire burned 12 cabins at its origin in the community of Holy Jim on Monday. It had grown to nearly 30 square miles (77 square kilometers) by Friday night. However, firefighters also doubled their containment from 5 to 10 percent. It&aposs one of nearly 20 blazes across California, which is seeing earlier, longer and more destructive wildfire seasons because of drought, warmer weather attributed to climate change and home construction deeper into forests. Firefighters aided by cooler weather have made good progress against a blaze burning for nearly a month near Yosemite National Park in the northern part of the state. The park was set to reopen Tuesday after a two-week closure, park spokesman Scott Gediman said Friday. Visitors should expect limited hours and visitor services next week as the park returns to normal, he said. The blaze didn&apost reach the heart of the park and instead burned in remote areas, making roads inaccessible and polluting the area with smoke. The closure dealt a financial blow to Yosemite at the height of the summer season and caused upheaval for thousands of tourists whose summer trips were canceled. Officials also gained more control over two other major Northern California wildfires, including the largest in recorded state history, even as evacuations were ordered for communities near a new fire in the Fall River Mills area, about 70 miles northeast of Redding. About 350 residents were under mandatory evacuation orders because of the Hat Fire, which began Thursday near a highway. In the south, Cleveland National Forest officials tweeted that the flames outside Los Angeles were growing as fast as crews can build lines to contain them. ""We continue to actively engage, but cannot get ahead of the fire,"" the statement said. Teresita Reyes was among some 20,000 people forced to evacuate, saying she was attending a wedding Wednesday when she received the order. The 51-year-old state health inspector congratulated the couple and left quietly for her house in the city of Lake Elsinore to grab important documents. Since then, Reyes and her husband have been staying at a hotel with a faulty air conditioner while their three dogs and cat are holed up at the family&aposs plumbing business. ""It is nerve-wracking and unreal,"" she said. ""We were on pins and needles for a little while there because it got real close."" The fire was deliberately set. A resident of Holy Jim has been charged with arson and other crimes and appeared in a jailhouse courtroom Friday. Forrest Clark, 51, made several outbursts, claiming his life was being threatened. A court commissioner postponed his arraignment until Aug. 17 and ordered bail to remain at $1 million. ""May I pay for that immediately?"" asked Clark, who could face life in prison if convicted. At one point, Clark covered his face with his long hair and later stared directly at a camera providing a video feed to reporters outside the courtroom. Michael Milligan, chief of the Holy Jim Volunteer Fire Department, has told the Orange County Register that Clark had a decade-long feud with neighbors and had sent him threatening emails last week, including one that said, ""This place will burn."" Crews turned a corner in their battle against Northern California&aposs Mendocino Complex Fire, the largest-ever in recorded state history, getting it 60 percent contained. The fire more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Sacramento has destroyed more than 100 homes and blackened an area about the size of Los Angeles. Near the Northern California city of Redding, the year&aposs deadliest fire was nearly half-surrounded and was burning into remote and rugged forest land. The Carr Fire has burned more than 1,000 homes. The fires all grew explosively in the past two weeks as winds whipped the flames through forest and rural areas full of timber and brush that is bone-dry from years of drought and a summer of record-breaking heat. Air quality has been another problem. A smoky haze stretches from the foothills of the Sierra Nevada range to Sacramento and hovers over the San Francisco Bay Area, with most major population centers in between enduring air quality that&aposs considered dangerous for many residents. The size of the fires brings new horror as the state still reels from enormous blazes last year and has yet to hit its most dangerous months historically. ___ Myers reported from Los Angeles.

1682482,Policy prescription for solving tough issues in Congress: 'Love Thy Neighbor' | TheHill,"Americans are divided. Hate speech and hate crimes are spiking. Fake news is increasing. Terrorism threatens the world and 60 million refugees are displaced across the globe. Elected officials don't seem to get much done regarding the shrinking middle class, immigration reform, climate change, gun violence, and a whole bunch more.  What should we do? ""Love thy neighbor."" That may seem like an odd and simplistic public policy prescription coming from a newly elected member of Congress. It may seem even more odd coming from a Democrat.  But, ""love thy neighbor"" is a concept that can been found across many traditions. If we are going to get Republicans and Democrats to actually come together as people of goodwill in search of the common good, it's going to require us to rely on some shared principles. Faith and religious beliefs are the most effective, existing sources of commonality that need to be emphasized and relied upon. If people of different political philosophies actually believed their opponents were similarly motivated by a common set of values to ""love thy neighbor,"" I believe we would get a lot more talking and problem-solving and less yelling and screaming. According to pew research 77% of Americans believe that religion is either very important or somewhat important in their lives. 69% of Americans attend religious services either once per week or several times per year. Even non-religious Americans have a fundamental belief in the religion-based concept of ""love thy neighbor."" Not only could politicians working across party lines and discussing issues rooted in shared faith and values result in more good work being accomplished, it could be good politics as well. It's always good politics for members of any party to actually get things done on behalf of the people they serve, but I believe it could be particularly good politics for Democrats to talk in terms of faith. Democrats are losing at every level government from the White House (even though we won the popular vote) and Capitol Hill to statehouses and state legislatures. I have listened very carefully to my fellow Democrats over the past month. "" Let's work on the message."" ""Let's target white blue collar men."" ""Let's fire the pollsters."" Changing the message or improving the tactics is what Democrats have worked on for a long time. It hasn't worked. Democrats have a cultural problem. People that have a faith based value system either don't vote for us, or they do, but have reservations. The Democratic Party has a religion problem and they better fix it. According to Pew Research, 56% of the people who attend religious services (of any kind) at least once per week, vote Republican. The good news is that I have found that most of my Democratic colleagues that I have met in my new job, seem genuinely inspired by their faith and have responded positively to the suggestion that we communicate more openly in terms of our different faith traditions. There will be challenges. Tough conversations regarding abortion, equal marriage, poverty, budget priorities, the environment, criminal justice, war and everything else will ensue. Fitting each of these topics into our political debates while also addressing our values emanating from our faith traditions will require rigorous thought and civil discourse. But guess what. It's always been tough. Maybe if we all agree on a starting point to ""love thy neighbor"" we might be a little more effective, but don't take my word for it.  Just look to the American motto - ""In God we Trust.""

1686079,U.S. Treasury publishes white paper in support of tax avoiders | TheHill,"The U.S. Treasury Department has just published a tax policy white paper which amounts to a lawyer’s brief defending the brazen abuses of tax administrative processes clandestinely orchestrated by U.S. firms in cahoots with a handful of European countries. It’s August, and nearly the end of the Administration’s term to boot, so in the ordinary course even tax professionals could be forgiven for ignoring the white paper. But this is not simply another tedious tax policy exercise. Simply put, “business friendly” jurisdictions (like Luxembourg) in substance offered through secret private deals to provide U.S. multinationals with tax shields in the form of their laws and European tax treaties, in return for what in substance were modest fees from the multinationals. All of this was revealed principally by the LuxLeaks scandal. I have worked in the area for 30 years, and I was awestruck by the sleaziness of the operations that came to light. Most observers – including Treasury itself, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, and many tax law academics and tax economists – agree multinationals in general, and U.S. multinationals in particular, are grandmasters at generating what I call “stateless income” – income that is stripped from the country with which it has the closest economic relationship (for example, the country where a firm’s consumers are located) and deposited in a congenial low-tax jurisdiction, like Ireland. This is how U.S. firms have come to hold over $2 trillion in very low taxed offshore earnings, much of it in cash. European countries have been particularly hard hit by these tax depredations, in part because they are not in complete control of their own tax systems. The European Union’s rules mandate that member states show deference to other member states in respect of important tax jurisdiction matters. That system never contemplated a world in which some enterprising member states would facilitate multinationals’ skimming of tax revenues from other member states. The European Commission has no direct authority to intervene in domestic member state tax matters. But the European Commission does have the authority to shut down illegal “state aid” – subsidies of one kind or another granted by a member state and meant to advantage one group of businesses over others. Often the subsidies are obvious, like low-cost government loans to a home country champion, but state aid principles apply in the tax arena as well. The European Commission has invoked the state aid laws to argue that Luxembourg and other countries entered into these secret tax deals in order systematically to privilege multinational firms over domestic European competitors, by creating (for a fee) artificial arrangements that enabled income to be stripped from other European countries without subjecting the shifted income to tax anywhere. The outcome, according to the European Commission, is an illegal tilting of the playing field, just like a subsidy to one favored company. As the Treasury white paper points out, the EC’s arguments are novel, and further are being applied retroactively. But Europe follows the rule of law, and the EC’s arguments ultimately will be tested in court. Treasury and the IRS also develop novel legal arguments all the time, and apply those to taxpayers’ past years that are still under audit, but Treasury has never reproached itself for allowing its thinking to evolve, or for applying that new thinking retroactively. The large companies that Treasury is protecting are all capable of defending themselves in European legal proceedings, and are almost all under sustained IRS audit attack for applying the same tactics to erode U.S. tax revenues. Particularly here, where the deals themselves were secret, it is galling for the United States to argue that the EC has gotten involved too late in the game to be permitted to enforce its own laws in its own jurisdiction. To date European countries rather than the United States have borne the tax revenue costs of the tax strategies covered by the whitepaper. Treasury’s brief thus signals to the world that the United States tolerates stateless income tax planning practiced against others. But Treasury has no business championing the cause of multinational tax avoiders, whether it is the United States or our European counterparts whose oxen are being gored. Treasury’s deeper reason for championing U.S. multinationals here relates not to the empathy they elicit, but to how state aid precepts intersect with corporate tax law. The EC brings a state aid case against a country (say, Ireland), not a company (Apple). But the country in turn is obligated to claw back the illegal state aid from the corporate beneficiary. Treasury’s concern is that if Apple or other affected firms are required to disgorge to Ireland or Luxembourg the taxes they should have paid, but didn’t, then those firms will turn around and claim those disgorgements as foreign tax payments that reduce their U.S. tax bills. Treasury sees U.S. firms holding a $2 trillion pot of very low-taxed offshore income and hopes to engineer an end game in which, as part of corporate tax reform, the United States is first in line to collect tax on that amount. But if those earnings had properly been reported in the first instance to the countries to which the income was most closely tied, U.S. firms would have paid foreign tax to Germany, France, and so on, and the United States would have ceded primary taxing authority to those countries. Treasury now is mustering the same sort of mock hurt feelings and outrage that U.S. companies display every time Treasury promulgates new tax regulations, this time in an effort to scare off the EC and European countries from collecting tax that should have been theirs in the first place.

The event is organized by a comedy group titled ""S#!TSHOW."" Trump shattered decades of precedent during the 2016 campaign by refusing to release his personal tax returns. At a news conference earlier this month, the president said that he had no intention of ever doing so, and argued that journalists were the only ones that wanted him to release the documents. Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway reaffirmed that the president would not release the returns, saying the “people didn’t care.” “The White House response is that he’s not going to release his tax returns,” she said during an appearance on ABC’s “This Week."" “We litigated this all through the election. People didn’t care. They voted for him.” Following Trump's election, a petition was launched on WhiteHouse.gov demanding Trump release his personal income tax returns. The petition has since broke the website's record with hundreds of thousands of signatures.     View the discussion thread.

1692932,Qatar hires Bush AG John Ashcroft for 'crisis response' | TheHill,"Qatar has hired John Ashcroft, the former attorney general under President George W. Bush who oversaw the war on terror's legal proceedings.  The decision to hire Ashcroft, who also previously served as a Missouri senator, comes after the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and several other Middle Eastern states accused Qatar of supporting terrorist efforts in the region.   President Trump escalated the Qatari government’s diplomatic crisis by also accusing it of funding terrorist organizations that aimed to destabilize the region. Bloomberg first reported the big-name hire after Ashcroft's law firm filed a public form with the Justice Department. Lobbyists and attorneys in the United States are queried to disclose efforts conducted on behalf of foreign entities. “The Firm’s work will include crisis response and management, program and system analysis, media outreach, education and advocacy regarding the Client’s historical, current, and future efforts to combat global terror and its compliance goals and accomplishments,” according to file issued on Friday. Ashcroft will take the lead on the efforts, and the law firm will receive $2.5 million as a “flat fee” for the first 90 days of covering expenses, as well as to make the project a ""top priority.” The document says Ashcroft will ""enlist the support and expertise of former key government leaders,” including those who once held ""very senior positions"" within the FBI, the U.S. intelligence community and both the departments of Treasury and Homeland Security “as necessary.” The firm will additionally advise Qatar on “international financial regulations including compliance with United States Treasury rules and regulations.” View the discussion thread.

Ryan is not expected to describe the details of a tax bill during the speech but ""will talk about what tax reform looks like, not just the benefits,"" the Speaker's office said. Ryan will give the speech at the National Association of Manufacturers' (NAM) summit in Washington. The group's president and CEO, Jay Timmons, is expected to moderate a question-and-answer session with Ryan after the speech. Ryan will deliver the speech just ahead of the one-year anniversary of the release of House Republicans' tax-reform blueprint.  The blueprint, which was part of Ryan's ""Better Way"" agenda, has served as a starting point for the tax-reform discussions that heated up after President Trump won the 2016 election. But portions of it, including its border-adjustment provision to tax imports and exempt exports, have received pushback from business leaders and some Republican lawmakers. In recent weeks, Ryan, other congressional leaders on tax reform and members of Trump's economic team have met several times in an effort to reach an agreement on tax reform. Lawmakers and administration officials have said they want to pass tax-reform legislation this year. Ryan's office said that Tuesday's speech is the speaker's first big address on the need for tax reform this year. He previously spoke about the need for tax reform at a roundtable with business leaders in Ohio in May. Ryan is not the only high-profile speaker expected at NAM's summit. Vice President Pence is also set to speak at the event on Tuesday, while House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Labor Secretary Alex Acosta are scheduled to speak on Wednesday.

A Snyder appointee made the decision to switch Flint’s drinking water supply as a cost-savings measure, and the state’s overall response to the growing crisis there has been roundly criticized.  The Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, has taken fire for knowing about the dangers presented by Flint’s drinking water well before the public did. The agency has said it did as much as it could to respond to the crisis by informing officials about their research, but lawmakers have said the agency should have done more.  Several other key players in the Flint saga — including Susan Hedman, the former regional head of the EPA, and Darnell Earley, Snyder’s former emergency manager for the city — will testify before the Oversight Committee.

The New York Times on Tuesday reported that a memo from Comey said the president had asked him to end the federal probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn in February. Comey wrote in a memo shortly after the meeting with Trump that the president told him, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.” The meeting took place Feb. 14, one day after Flynn resigned, according to the Times, which said Comey’s memo was part of his effort to create a paper trail about what the former director saw as Trump's improper influence on the Flynn investigation. The Senate Intelligence Committee has since sent Comey a request to testify publicly. Comey declined the panel’s first invite last week, reportedly preferring public testimony to meeting with members behind closed doors. Trump fired Comey last week.

1717834,Blame the college kids for May's weak jobs report | TheHill,"The employment picture in May was surprisingly weak, with employment outside the agriculture sector growing only 138,000. April employment growth was also revised lower, adding to the general malaise in the report.  The deceleration in hiring was broad-based, as employment in the goods, services and government sector all slowed. All major sectors of the economy showed slower employment growth, except for construction and temporary help services. So what’s going on, and should we be worried? On one hand, an increase in payroll employment of 138,000 is more than enough to keep overall labor market conditions improving and the unemployment rate moving lower. In other words, we’re still moving in the right direction, but the rate of improvement is just slower. That’s not all bad. On the other hand, and this is the important part, history says slowing employment growth is often a sign for worry. Labor markets, in the eyes of economists like myself who follow the ebb and flow of the data quite closely, are “information rich”; they tell us a lot about the overall health of the economy in real time, and there is much more signal than noise in labor market data. How good are labor markets as a signal about the health of the economy? Since 1960, a slowdown in employment growth has preceded every recession. Note, I didn’t say “coincided with"", but “preceded"". One simple way to see this is to compare the current pace of employment growth against the average during any particular expansion. Across multiple business cycles, we find that employment growth gradually increases following any recession and then largely moves sideways for the duration of the expansion. Yes, payroll growth can be volatile from month-to-month, but the change in employment tends to fluctuate around a fairly stable trend during expansions. This pattern is apparent during the long expansions of the 1960s, 1980s, and 1990s and the current recovery.  When employment growth starts to slow below the recovery-level average, watch out. Historically, employment growth drops below the average change in employment during the expansion about a year before the onset of the next recession. The average gain in employment has been about 185,000 per month since 2010. Viewed through this lens, the slowing to 138,000 in May could be legitimate cause for concern. We think not. Instead, we think you should blame it on college kids. Ok, not really. But we believe there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the timing of the survey week meant that college-age workers, who return to the job market in large numbers beginning in May, were undercounted. The survey week for the employment report is the week including the 12th of the month. Hence, the May employment report is really a picture of how mid-May hiring compared to mid-April. But the days of the month vary, and when the survey week for the May employment report falls in the second week of the month, like it did this year, reported employment growth tends to be suppressed since fewer numbers of college-age workers are captured. However, when the survey week for the May employment report falls in the third week of the month, reported payroll growth tends to be stronger since the extra week means the survey has a greater likelihood of capturing their return. We examined private employment growth in the month of May since 1980 and, excluding recessions, found that average growth in private payrolls was 110,000 when the survey week falls in the second week of the month (there were 15 such occasions). Of the 18 times the survey week fell in the third week of the month, private employment growth averaged 176,000, for an average difference of 66,000. If calendar day effects and the timing of the survey week are a factor behind the weaker-than-expected May employment report, and we believe they are, then we are inclined to downplay any negative signal about heightened recessionary risks. Employment should rebound next month, and the economy should remain on its modest growth path. We believe the Fed will see things the same way and look for it to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points in June and proceed to balance sheet runoff in September.  Michael Gapen is the chief U.S. economist for Barclays.

1726401,Conflict of Interest Rule needs to stand | TheHill,"June 22 marks the Financial Planning Association’s Third Annual D.C. Advocacy Day, which we began in response to members wanting to be more active in supporting policies that advance the financial planning profession and making sure legislators heard from actual practitioners about issues than can affect their livelihoods. Last year, as the U.S. Department of Labor’s fiduciary issue was heating up, we were on Capitol Hill meeting with legislators and regulators to advocate for the rule, as well as to advocate for smart, common-sense changes. We sought changes that would still protect American savers and ease some of the compliance and reporting aspects of the rule, including the extension of the implementation deadline. The one-, five- and 10-year reporting was also eliminated. As part of the Financial Planning Coalition, we have advocated in many different ways, but nothing beats a mass of financial planners in the same place, at one time, speaking with a unified voice. And our voice is unique: As an association, we represent our members, most of whom are certified financial planner (CFP) professionals, and we were supportive of a rule that many in the industry fought with lobbyists and money and more lobbyists and money.  And we won. So far. Before we get too altruistic, a fiduciary standard for retirement savers is just part of the puzzle. As CFP professionals, we already were acting as fiduciaries when providing planning advice. It benefits our practices and our clients to give fiduciary service. Now the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) needs to act to cover the rest of the savings gap by extending a uniform fiduciary rule to broker-dealers. Our association is compensation neutral and business model neutral — what draws us together is the fiduciary standard. When we have a client and are providing financial planning, we do it for all of their savings, not just part. Even as I write there are lawsuits mounting with regard to the Department of Labor’s Conflict of Interest Final Rule — the fiduciary rule — and they will take time to work their way through the courts. This June 22, though, we will be on Capitol Hill to try to thwart the latest threat, H.J.R. 88, which would prevent the department from implementing the Conflict of Interest Rule and which will be considered today. It has already passed both houses on a majority vote. The president vowed to veto the bill when it got to his desk — and he did. Now it will take a two-thirds majority in both houses to override the president’s veto, and you can believe our members of Congress are hearing from the industry that would like to see this rule go away. Far away. They will hear from us again this year — and the next year, and the year after that. When, eventually, the SEC moves on fiduciary rule-making, we will be there, too, advocating for our members and American savers. To us, there is no better choice.   Sandy is 2016 president of the Financial Planning Association. View the discussion thread.

1736201,EU regulators nearing decision on Google antitrust case | TheHill,"European regulators appear to be moving toward a decision on whether or not to bring their third set of formal charges against Google. Regulators are reportedly probing contracts related to Google’s AdWords product. Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner on antitrust issues, said that her team was moving forward with the probe, according to Bloomberg. ""I hope that we can end that or come to a preliminary conclusion,"" she said in Brussels. She also said she hoped that she could reach a decision on the case inside of a “reasonable time frame.” If the regulator decides to bring a preliminary case against Google, it would add to a pile of antitrust cases facing the company on the continent. Vestager alleged last year that Google had violated competition laws by favoring its own comparison shopping service. More recently, she brought preliminary charges against the company for allegedly using restrictive contracts for smartphone manufacturers using its Android operating system. Regulators allege that Google used the contracts to push manufacturers to preload its applications. Vestager defended the latter probe on Thursday. “Most of us will never download a new app to replace one we already have,” she said. “So by making sure we start with Google apps, the company can be confident that few of us will ever think about trying its competitors' products.” Google has pushed back on all of the allegations; it will be able to present its case to the regulators after a formal set of preliminary charges are released. American regulators may also be taking a fresh look at Google’s operations. Politico reported this week that the Federal Trade Commission had been discussing Google’s search service with a major American company, at the latter’s request. That could signal that there is willingness at the FTC to revisit concerns about Google’s dominant business. The agency ultimately halted a probe into the issue in 2013. View the discussion thread.

1737334,"Juan Williams: Trump, false promises and the economy | TheHill","“It’s the economy, stupid!” That was Democratic strategist James Carville’s famous bottom line on the 1992 presidential election. Fast forward to 2016 and once again it looks like “It’s the economy, stupid.” Hillary ClintonHillary Diane Rodham ClintonLewandowski on potential NH Senate run: If I run, 'I'm going to win' Fighter pilot vs. astronaut match-up in Arizona could determine control of Senate  Progressive Democrats' turnout plans simply don't add up MORE, the likely Democratic nominee for president, is more trusted than her Republican rival to handle terrorism, income inequality, healthcare and immigration.

Meanwhile, a recent battery of Quinnipiac polls in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, critical swing states, found Trump holding leads over Clinton ranging from 9 points to 14 points as the candidate better trusted to lead the economy. Nationwide, the economy is the number one issue for voters. Trump is winning their confidence without specific economic proposals. So far voters are simply cheering his promise to bring back jobs in manufacturing and coal mining while ending trade deals that allow big companies like Nabisco to leave the USA to make cookies with cheaper workers in Mexico. His backers also cheer when he says — again minus any plan — that he will build a wall and deport illegal immigrants. Part of his reasoning is that this will improve the job market for blue-collar workers. The applause continues when Trump excoriates Clinton and President Obama for increased environmental regulation of the coal, oil and gas industries. Trump’s message echoes the dismal economic drumbeat on conservative talk radio, television and web sites. Among the right-wing faithful, Obama is considered a failure for his handling of the economy.  The only problem here is the facts.  Since Obama took office in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, the economy has added over 14.6 million private sector jobs. There have been 75 straight months of private job growth. The current unemployment rate is 5 percent; effectively full employment. In March 2016, the labor force participation rate — people with jobs and people looking for work because they believe they can find a job — was at its highest level in almost two years. Those good numbers reflect the reality that, for the last seven months, the unemployment rate has been at its lowest levels since before the 2008 financial collapse.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the NASDAQ and the Wilshire 5000 have all more than doubled since Obama became president. He has done all of this while reducing the federal deficit by nearly $1 trillion. Yes, Obama reduced the federal deficit.   A New York Times magazine profile of the president last month began with Obama lamenting that his indisputably successful efforts to revive the economy after the 2008 financial crisis are ignored amid the partisan politics of 2016.  “I actually compare our economic performance to how, historically, countries that have wrenching financial crises perform,” Obama told the Times. “By that measure, we probably managed this better than any large economy on Earth in modern history.” Those comments caught the eye of George Washington University political science professor John Sides. “In an age of polarization, Americans may give little credit to a president not of their own party,” Sides wrote on the Washington Post website. “A good comparison is again to the last quarter of 1983, when consumer sentiment was essentially the same as at the end of 2015. At that point in time, 87 percent of Republicans approved of President Ronald Reagan, as did 30 percent of Democrats. At the end of 2015, Obama’s support in his own party was almost as high, 79 percent, but it was much lower among Republicans, 10 percent —exactly where it had been for almost six years.” Sides’s analysis fits with the president’s assessment of why there is a lack of acclaim for his economic success. Obama told the Times that voters’ attitudes about the economy reflect leading GOP voices constantly telling the party’s base “that things are terrible all the time.” Meanwhile, Trump is refusing to release his tax returns even as he brags that he has made billions. And he startled financial markets recently when he said that, if elected president, he might not pay back the nation’s debts. He then had to walk away from those words. ""I'm the king of debt,” Trump said. “I understand debt probably better than anybody. I know how to deal with debt very well. I love debt. ""This is the United States government,” he explained. “You never have to default because you print the money, I hate to tell you. Okay, so there’s never a default.""  Clinton’s campaign cited Trump’s comments as evidence that he is in over his head when it comes to economics.  But even conservative economists are horrified at the prospect of Trump as the chief steward of the American economy.  “In all my years as an economist… I have never seen such nonsense as we just heard from Mr. Trump and it breaks my heart, it makes me want to cry,” economist and comedian Ben Stein said on television.  Tony Fratto, an official in George W. Bush’s Treasury Department, tweeted about Trump’s comments on the debt: “Dumb as a bucket of rocks.” And yet Trump’s simple bluster has voters preferring him to Clinton when it comes to the economy.

1740145,Last orders: Rise of closing auctions stirs worries in European stock markets,"LONDON (Reuters) - The final five minutes of trading have become the busiest time of day for stock market traders in Europe. Aside from an initial burst of activity after the open in the morning followed by a brief flurry when Wall Street opens, a growing portion of the daily equity volumes is now concentrated into the five-minute closing auctions at the end of the day. The growing popularity of passive and index-tracking funds and tougher regulations are driving the shift, which is draining liquidity in the $11.1 trillion market and raising concerns about big price swings and possible disruption to price discovery. The trend is also fracturing the industry as rivals look to take a slice of the action by launching their own post-close trading products. If sustained, it will likely stir the debate about whether there is even a need in the long term for an elongated trading day. Products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and hedge funds typically use end-of-day prices set during the closing auctions for their daily pricing. Equity ETFs in Europe have ballooned in recent years and are now worth about 500 billion euro ($558 billion). That’s up more than 8% in the first half of the year and a whopping 38% from January 2017, according to Morningstar data. With their rise, the five-minute window between 1530 and 1535 GMT each day is capturing a bigger portion of daily volume, which averaged about 70 billion euros in June. Closing auctions across Europe’s major bourses have on average accounted for 20% of daily average volumes in the first half of this year, and hit their highest on record of 23% in June, according to Rosenblatt Securities which tracks volumes. That’s up from just 13% three years ago. There is a similar trend in the United States, where activity is also clustering in the auctions. Activity typically spikes in the final month of each quarter, as funds scramble to participate in the auctions that set the value of their investments for the quarter. This year though, there has been a pronounced and steady rise each month as banks, brokers and asset managers find the auctions provide the deepest pool of liquidity. “The rest of the day is meaningless and you can’t see flow,” said Andrea Vismara, chief executive office at Italian boutique investment bank Equita. The jump has been particularly noticeable this year as overall trading volumes have slowed amid tighter regulation and rising costs and as investors have in general shunned equities even as prices have soared. Onerous paperwork imposed by the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), which came into force early last year, has also helped drive the shift. The reporting process for regulatory purposes is simpler if trading is executed at the closing auction. The trend has drawn the scrutiny of the French market regulator Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF), which warned last month that lower liquidity may distort price-setting mechanisms and increase price swings. Closing auctions on Euronext's (ENX.PA) Paris blue-chip CAC 40 stock index .FCHI account for as much as 40% of volume, it found. “The associated risks are a deterioration in price formation and liquidity during trading sessions, not to mention the operational vulnerabilities at the end of the day given the volumes concentrated in the closing auction,” the watchdog said in its report. GRAPHIC: Closing auction volumes - here.png While it’s not clear if it has yet disrupted price formation, interviews with a dozen traders and senior executives at international banks, brokerages, wealth managers and exchanges show that the trend is upending how they do business. For a start, liquidity begets liquidity - as more traffic goes through the closing auction, it has a self-amplifying effect. “In many cases, volumes in the closing auctions are so significant they cannot be ignored,” said Derek McCole, head of equity dealing for EMEA at Aberdeen Standard Investments. He has adjusted to the new norm. He tends to place a percentage of an order at the settlement price in the closing auction and then opportunistically trade the rest of the order if a certain price is hit. But some executives say it is getting more difficult to do big block trades during the day, forcing many to save large transactions until the end of the day. That leads to even lower liquidity during the remaining 8-1/2 hours. “The market opens, nothing happens and then the U.S. come in. It’s busy for the first hour and then it quietens down,” said a senior executive at a global bank. “People are struggling to get orders done. If people are looking for blocks, they wait until the closing auction.” For exchange operators like Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) and the London Stock Exchange (LSE.L), the rise of closing auctions provides a rare and much-needed source of revenue. The exchanges often charge higher fees to transact in the closing auction compared with intraday levels. Each bourse has a different fee structure so it’s hard to pinpoint an exact premium. But signs have emerged that the financial industry is divided over the trend, with CBOE Europe and Aquis Exchange (AQX.L) launching rival platforms to break the exchanges’ monopoly. CBOE says it will not charge customers until the end of the year to use its 3C product, while Aquis charges a fixed 10,000 pound subscription. Aquis Chief Executive Alasdair Haynes said he wants his company’s Market at Close product to provide competition to the exchanges. He estimates the fees for closing auctions are costing the industry an extra 75-100 million pounds each year. The product got UK regulatory approval a few years ago, but it has only seen volume pick up in recent weeks, a spokeswoman said. That rise in interest has come as banks aim to slash costs due to razor-thin margins, which have been eroded by the burden of extra regulation and lower volumes. “There is no doubt there is a correlation with banks trying to save money and the interest in our product where there’s a serious cost reduction for the banks,” Haynes said. But the Aquis and CBOE foray has, in turn, stirred worries about drawing liquidity away from the main exchanges. “There’s a perception that the exchanges exploit their monopoly position for the closing auctions, so the lower fees offered by alternative products may be attractive for brokers,” said Rosenblatt Securities’ market structure analyst for Europe, Anish Puarr. But “there may be a danger in fragmenting” liquidity in the auctions, which provide a vitally important official closing price, he said. Investors like Equita and Aberdeen are also worried that alternatives could attract volumes away from closing auctions, distorting price creation. “As these different ways of trading the close appear, that could potentially weaken the existing closing structure if liquidity gravitates away from the primary market onto these other mechanisms,” said McCole.

1744467,Oversight head: Hackers would hit mother lode at Education Department | TheHill,"House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason ChaffetzJason ChaffetzHouse Oversight panel demands DeVos turn over personal email records The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by JUUL Labs - Trump attack on progressive Dems draws sharp rebuke GOP senators decline to criticize Acosta after new Epstein charges MORE (R-Utah) is warning that a hack on the Department of Education would dwarf last year’s massive breach at the Office of Personnel Management. “Almost half of America’s records are sitting at the Department of Education,” Chaffetz said at a Brookings Institution event on Thursday. “I think ultimately that’s going to be the largest data breach that we’ve ever seen in the history of our nation.” The Department of Education's cybersecurity practices have been in the spotlight since a November Inspector General (IG) report found widespread deficiencies. The agency also received an F grade on a federal scorecard that ranks agencies on the implementation of four key provisions of the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA), which was enacted in December 2014. Oversight lawmakers lambasted the department for its poor cybersecurity during a November hearing, hitting the agency for a failure to heed repeated warnings from the IG that its information systems are vulnerable to hackers. The IT practices of federal agencies have been under fierce scrutiny in the wake of the devastating breach of the Office of Personnel Management that was revealed last spring. The agency was widely seen as having “left the barn door open” from a data security perspective, allowing hackers to pilfer the records of 21.5 million federal employees and others. Chaffetz said Thursday that part of the the problem at the Education Department is the sheer volume of systems used by the agency to collect and manage data — 184 in total, according to the November IG report.

During his visit to MacDill Air Force Base, the sprawling base that sits on the Tampa Bay, he'll receive briefings from both Centcom and the U.S. Special Operations Command that are based there. White House press secretary Sean Spicer added that Trump plans to share lunch with soldiers stationed at MacDill before giving a speech to the soldiers. National security adviser Michael Flynn and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford will travel with the president.

1760985,Democrats should not expect a blue wave in mid-term elections | TheHill,"Democrats are dreaming if they expect a Democratic blue wave in the 2018 mid-term elections to carry them to majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives.  Democratic leaders live in an anti-Trump bubble and obsess about Trump’s misbehavior. They believe most voters share their dismay about Trump’s outrageous conduct and thus won’t vote for his Republican candidates in the upcoming elections. They believe Democratic candidates can stress anti-Trump sentiments, expound on socially progressive ideas and identity politics, brand themselves as strong Democrats and win elections. Party leaders are badly mistaken. All politics is local. A winning candidate needs a local focus. Two recent congressional races illustrate the two paths that Democrat candidates can take. Jon Ossoff ran in a conservative district in Georgia and lost. His campaign did not reflect local issues and values. The campaign stressed opposition to Trump, identity politics, and progressive cultural positions that bumped-up against politically and socially conservative outlooks.  In Pennsylvania, Conor Lamb ran and won in a conservative, working class district that had given Trump a 20-point margin in 2016. His campaign focused on local issues, concerns and values. He stressed the economic wellbeing of his district and promised to fight to protect coal-miner worker pensions, Social Security and Medicare. The Ossoff- style and campaign narrative reflected the new Democrat – the one who abandoned the working and middle class in favor of the young, affluent, diverse, well educated, and successful in the new digital economy.  While this may be the majority of the future, today it is reflective only of the West Coast and the Northeast that have prospered in the high-tech economy.  Elections throughout the 50 states will be won by focusing on the working and middle class and by proposing ideas that appeal locally, especially in districts and states that traditionally have supported Republicans. Republicans are in an advantageous position to keep their majority in the Senate.  In the midterm elections, they will be defending eight seats. Democrats will defend 26.  Nevada is the one vulnerable Republican Senate seat. The Democrats, on the other hand, have several Senate seats that are in jeopardy in conservative states that supported Trump and other Republicans. These include Bill NelsonClarence (Bill) William NelsonAl Franken says he 'absolutely' regrets resigning  Democrats target Florida Hispanics in 2020 Poll: Six Democrats lead Trump in Florida match-ups MORE in Florida, Joe ManchinJoseph (Joe) ManchinSunday shows - Recession fears dominate Manchin: Trump has 'golden opportunity' on gun reforms Trump vows to 'always uphold the Second Amendment' amid ongoing talks on gun laws MORE in West Virginia, Heidi HeitkampMary (Heidi) Kathryn HeitkampPence to push new NAFTA deal in visit to Iowa Al Franken says he 'absolutely' regrets resigning  Trump nominees meet fiercest opposition from Warren, Sanders, Gillibrand MORE in North Dakota, Claire McCaskillClaire Conner McCaskillEx-CIA chief worries campaigns falling short on cybersecurity Ocasio-Cortez blasts NYT editor for suggesting Tlaib, Omar aren't representative of Midwest Trump nominees meet fiercest opposition from Warren, Sanders, Gillibrand MORE in Missouri, Joe Donnnelly in Indiana, and Tammy BaldwinTammy Suzanne BaldwinTrade wars and the over-valued dollar Overnight Health Care: Senate panel advances drug pricing bill amid GOP blowback | House panel grills Juul executives | Trump gives boost to state drug import plans | Officials say new migrant kids' shelter to remain open but empty Senators vow to bring transparency to drug pricing MORE in Wisconsin.  If Republicans want to win, they should nominate popular, mainstream candidates. In the House, the Republicans are more vulnerable and could lose their majority -- despite their substantial gerrymandering advantage. Many Republican House members are retiring, and open seats are more likely to be successfully challenged by the opposition party. If Democrats want to win, they will have to run Conor Lamb-style candidates. To win in the mid-terms, Democrats need to leave the anti-Trump bubble and conviction that a new majority of young, millennial, affluent, diverse and socially progressive voters will magically emerge in red states. Republican Senate candidate Roy MooreRoy Stewart MooreGOP Senate candidate 'pissed off' at Trump over health care for veterans Durbin says he has second thoughts about asking for Franken's resignation Alabama GOP senate candidate says 'homosexual activities' have ruined TV, country's moral core MORE in Alabama was a gift to the Democratic Party. He was discredited and lost. Nevertheless, Democrats should not expect many such gifts.  Instead, Democrats must reconnect with the middle- and working-class voters.  They can do this with a broad inclusive message coupled with stress on individual state and congressional district concerns. Polling on the generic ballot, indicating which party voters would support in a congressional election, show the Democratic Party ahead by 4 percent. This is down from 12 percent and means a more difficult path for Democrats to overcome the advantage Republicans have in Congress. With the exception of the reelection of Barak Obama in 2012, Democrats have done poorly over the last four election cycles. To break the pattern requires letting go of their flawed and often demeaning attitude about working-class and red state voters.  They need to address voters with understanding and appreciation of their concerns and values. And they need to remember all politics is local.  Joshua Sandman, Ph.D. is a professor of political science at the University of New Haven, where he has studied the presidency and Congressional politics for 50 years.

The editorial, ""Donald Trump Sure Has a Problem With Democracy,"" comes after Trump praised China’s Community Party for abolishing presidential term limits, effectively giving Xi power indefinitely. “He's now president for life. President for life. No, he's great,"" Trump reportedly told Republican donors during a closed-door event in Florida. “And look, he was able to do that. I think it's great. Maybe we'll give that a shot someday."" The New York Times editorial board said the president's reported comments are reflective of his general world outlook. ""There’s something in the man that impels him reflexively to celebrate the authoritarian model,"" the editorial board wrote. “Mr. Trump was surely joking about becoming president for life himself. But there can be little doubt now that he truly sees no danger in Mr. Xi’s “great” decision to extend his own rule until death,” the editorial board added. ""That craven reaction is in line with Mr. Trump’s consistent support and even admiration for men ruling with increasing brutal and autocratic methods — Vladimir Putin of Russia, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, to name a few."" The editorial board went on to write that Trump lost the popular vote by 3 million ballots in the 2016 presidential election and claimed victory due to the electoral college, “not to mention with some help from Russia."" “It may be understandable that he would be uncomfortable with democracy,” the board wrote.  The editorial also criticized Trump's praise of Xi specifically, noting the Chinese president has enacted increasingly authoritarian measures.  “On the way to amassing more power for himself, Mr. Xi has moved to crush all rivals, silence all dissent, undermine Chinese institutions, promote a cult of personality, weaken the free market economy, destroy any hint of an independent press and otherwise tighten control over a society that is already among the world’s most restricted,” the board wrote.  On his own soil, Trump has been “strangely indifferent” to foreign threats, including Russian interference in the 2016 election, the editorial added. “He has also proven ignorant of and impatient with checks on presidential power, whether they be courts that thwart his unconstitutional actions or a Justice Department that won’t jump to his orders to investigate political rivals,” the board said.  President George Washington, who was elected two terms reluctantly, warned against tyranny but “Donald Trump just doesn’t get it,"" the board wrote.

1767572,Five things to know about Trump’s immigration principles | TheHill,"The White House is putting a high price on any deal that would allow young immigrants who entered the United States illegally to stay in the country and work. In exchange for legislation that would turn the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program into law, the Trump administration wants money for the president’s proposed border wall, sweeping border security measures, crackdowns on so-called “sanctuary cities” and new measures to curb the number of unaccompanied minors crossing the southern border. Democrats are unlikely to agree to the set of demands, raising real questions about the path forward for DACA, the Obama-era program Trump began to wind down last month.  Here are five things to know about the White House’s proposal:  Dead on arrival?  The White House demands were quickly condemned by Democrats. Sen. Charles SchumerCharles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerLewandowski on potential NH Senate run: If I run, 'I'm going to win' Appropriators warn White House against clawing back foreign aid Colorado candidates vying to take on Gardner warn Hickenlooper they won't back down MORE (N.Y.) and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), the top Democrats in the Senate and House, were particularly irked that the proposal included several so-called poison pills that were not a part of last month's talks with Trump — especially the border wall funding.  “This list goes so far beyond what is reasonable,” the two leaders said in a joint statement.  It also has the potential to divide Republicans, who could balk at cuts to legal immigration that were included in the plan. GOP lawmakers from border states are also skeptical of Trump’s proposal to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.  Advocates on both sides of the immigration debate expressed pessimism that a deal could be reached, but stressed the talks are not over yet. Lawmakers could pick and choose parts of Trump’s wish list in an effort to craft a viable proposal.  Doug Andres, a spokesman for Speaker Paul RyanPaul  Davis RyanEmbattled Juul seeks allies in Washington Ex-Parkland students criticize Kellyanne Conway Latina leaders: 'It's a women's world more than anything' MORE (R-Wis.), said House members “will review these principles” and continue to consult with the administration on a bill.  Let’s make a deal The million-dollar question surrounding the plan is whether Trump sees it as a final offer or the beginning of a negotiation.  Trump signaled his willingness to make a deal to protect DACA recipients when he gave Congress a six-month window to broker a solution.  Despite his hard-line rhetoric on immigration, Trump has long spoken favorably about young undocumented immigrants who benefit from the plan. He said in February he wanted to treat them “with heart.” But since then, his team has driven a hard bargain, sparking talk that immigration restrictionists inside the administration are trying to regain control and ensure DACA is permanently quashed.  The proof could come if or when Trump draws any red lines. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said he cannot envision a scenario in which Trump backs away from the wall money. “The president has boxed himself in on the wall issue,” he said.  Groups that favor strict immigration controls also say a new requirement that employers use E-Verify, which is used to verify employees’ immigration status, is nonnegotiable for them.  Both measures, however, would be deal-breakers for Democrats, whose votes Trump will need to pass a DACA fix through Congress.  The citizenship question  Another major fault line is whether DACA recipients would be allowed to become U.S. citizens.  Democrats, and some Republicans, have long called for a path to citizenship for ""Dreamers,"" a group of roughly 1.5 million young undocumented immigrants. Around 800,000 people benefit from DACA.  But a White House official indicated citizenship could be off the table, telling reporters that the administration is “not interested in granting citizenship” in a DACA deal.  Under that model, DACA recipients could live in the U.S. and receive work permits, but without any assurance they could remain long term.  That would satisfy many immigration hard-liners who worry making them citizens could spark a wave of so-called “chain migration” — with DACA recipients’ relatives coming to the U.S. to join them.  But immigrant-rights advocates say it’s a nonstarter, arguing citizenship for all ""Dreamers"" is well within the GOP mainstream.

But White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller is said to have spearheaded the effort to draft the principles and push them on Capitol Hill. He was joined by Attorney General Jeff SessionsJefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsDOJ should take action against China's Twitter propaganda Lewandowski says he's 'happy' to testify before House panel The Hill's Morning Report — Trump and the new Israel-'squad' controversy  MORE, his former boss during their days in the Senate.  Both have long pushed for aggressive measures to curb the flow of illegal immigration and tough new measures to apprehend those living illegally in the U.S.  Miller has solidified his influence inside the West Wing and the principles are one of the clearest examples yet of his ability to shape the administration’s stance on an issue about which he cares deeply. By advancing these principles, Miller could also make it more difficult for Trump to get a deal on DACA — and thus more likely for the program to disappear. Campaign promises Trump has taken heat for months over his inability to secure a legislative victory or whittle down a lengthy list of unfulfilled campaign promises, including the wall.  But Trump has checked a lot of boxes on immigration.  In addition to his decision to scrap DACA, he has issued new directives that dramatically increase the number of immigrants considered priorities for deportation.  The administration has threatened to withhold federal aid to “sanctuary cities” that refuse to help federal authorities enforce immigration law. It has claimed the measures have resulted in a major spike in border apprehensions, and that a surge of new immigration judges are helping to close cases faster.  The latest proposal is an indication that the Trump administration wants to step up its hard-line approach, and not go in the other direction.   View the discussion thread.

1786935,Zinke reprimanded park head after climate tweets | TheHill,"Interior Secretary Ryan ZinkeRyan Keith ZinkeNew policy at Interior's in-house watchdog clamps down on interactions with press Overnight Energy: EPA proposes scrapping limits on coal plant waste | Appointee overseeing federal lands once advocated selling them | EPA lifts Obama-era block on controversial mine Latest appointee overseeing federal public lands once advocated to sell them MORE brought the leader of a California park to his office last month to reprimand him for climate change-related tweets the park had sent via Twitter, two sources close to the situation said. Zinke did not take any formal disciplinary action against David Smith, superintendent of Joshua Tree National Park. And the tweets at issue weren’t deleted, because they didn’t violate National Park Service or Interior Department policies. But Zinke made it clear to Smith that the Trump administration doesn’t want national parks to put out official communications on climate change. And by bringing Smith from California to Washington, D.C., to deliver the tongue-lashing, he also sent a message to the park service at large. One source said Smith “got a trip to the woodshed” and described his one-on-one meeting with Zinke as “highly unusual.” Another source said Zinke expressed concern with the tweets during the meeting, and told Smith “no more climate tweets.” Other sources with knowledge of the meeting confirmed that Zinke wanted to stop tweets about climate change. The Park Service didn’t respond to various questions about the situation, including requests to confirm the Zinke-Smith meeting and to identify who sent the tweets at issue. “Many of our 417 National Park sites have a social media presence and content is generally determined at a local level,” Park Service spokesman Jeremy Barnum said in a statement. Smith did not talk to The Hill for this story, and the Park Service did not make him available for an interview. Heather Swift, a spokeswoman for Zinke, denied the description of the meeting. “You have been given really bad information,” she said, declining to elaborate or to make Zinke available for an interview. The meeting came after a series of 15 tweets were sent on Nov. 8 by Joshua Tree’s Twitter account. The tweets were focused on climate change’s impacts both on national parks in general and on Joshua Tree in particular.  The tweets were based on scientific conclusions, sometimes citing federal government reports and including caveats when necessary. “An overwhelming consensus—over 97%—of climate scientists agree that human activity is the driving force behind today's rate of global temperature increase. Natural factors that impact the climate are still at work, but cannot account for today’s rapid warming,” read the first tweet of the series. “Current models predict the suitable habitat for Joshua trees may be reduced by 90% in the future with a 3°C (5.4°F) increase in average temperature over the next 100 years,” said another. It detailed climate change’s expected impacts on the desert Southwest, including on flora and fauna species like pinyon pine and desert iguana, and linked to a Park Service web page with more details on Joshua Tree and climate change. The tweets got significant attention, garnering far more retweets and likes than the vast majority of tweets from national park accounts. It’s not the first controversy surrounding the Park Service’s social media under the Trump administration. On the day of President TrumpDonald John TrumpTrump pushes back on recent polling data, says internal numbers are 'strongest we've had so far' Illinois state lawmaker apologizes for photos depicting mock assassination of Trump Scaramucci assembling team of former Cabinet members to speak out against Trump MORE’s inauguration, the Park Service’s main Twitter account retweeted a comparison of the inauguration crowd size on the National Mall — which the agency manages — against an obviously larger crowd from former President Obama’s 2009 inauguration. The tweet was soon deleted. Days later, the Twitter account of South Dakota’s Badlands National Park sent out tweets with facts about climate change. They were deleted, and the agency said a former employee with access to the account was responsible. Trump’s opponents celebrated both episodes, along with the Joshua Tree tweets, as rebellion against the new administration, including Trump’s skepticism of human-induced climate change. Conservationists say Zinke’s admonishment over the Joshua Tree tweets is especially troubling, both because of the chilling effect on the agency and as a sign of the administration’s views on global warming. “This meeting shows how little respect Secretary Zinke has for the front-line employees who manage our national parks and public lands. It also reveals how far the Trump administration will go to hide basic facts from the American people,” said Aaron Weiss, spokesman for the Center for Western Priorities, which has fought much of Zinke’s agenda. Zinke’s decision to call the Joshua Tree superintendent to Washington also serves as a window into Zinke’s leadership style. He’s caught significant attention as Interior secretary for his brash style, reflected in direct attacks on the outdoor gear maker Patagonia after it criticized him; accusations that “the dishonest media or political operatives” were trying to tie him to Whitefish Energy’s utility repair contract in Puerto Rico; and his declaration that controversies surrounding his travel spending are “a little BS.” Zinke has instructed employees to raise a flag for the secretary atop Interior’s building when he is there and has had commemorative coins made for him. Maureen Finnerty, a retired Park Service superintendent and career official with the agency, accused Zinke of ignoring science in criticizing the tweets. “The parks should be at the forefront of climate change discussion, because it’s impacting them,” she said. Finnerty is chairwoman of the Coalition to Protect National Parks, a group composed largely of retired Park Service employees who advocate on numerous agency issues. In Zinke’s time as secretary, he’s worked to roll back nearly all of the department’s major climate policies, including a moratorium on new coal mining on federal land and a policy to limit methane emissions from oil and natural gas drilling. The changes have been less pronounced at the Park Service. But the agency did scrap a controversial Obama administration policy from December 2016 that asked parks to formulate plans for preserving natural resources and protecting them from threats like climate change. If Zinke wants park employees to avoid talking about climate change, he should be more transparent about it, Finnerty said. “They should go through the process, they should be transparent about it, they should seek whatever input they need, and then they can change the policy,” she said.

1787071,TrueCar ends car buying partnership with NRA | TheHill,"A car pricing company is cutting ties with the National Rifle Association (NRA), joining a growing list of companies doing so following the Florida high school shooting. TrueCar announced Friday on Twitter that it would end its car buying service relationship with the NRA on Feb. 28. TrueCar is ending its car buying service relationship with the NRA effective February 28, 2018. The partnership with TrueCar allowed NRA members to save an average of nearly $3,400 off retail price on new and used cars, according to the NRA’s website. The company’s tweet follows similar announcements from other car rental and insurance companies — including Enterprise, Hertz, Alamo and MetLife — cutting off ties with the NRA. The gun lobbying group has come under scrutiny amid calls for gun control following the Florida shooting earlier this month, with some companies responding to the pressure by distancing themselves from the organization. The First National Bank of Omaha also ended its business relationship with the NRA, announcing earlier this week that it would end its contract to issue NRA-branded credit cards. The outcry against the NRA comes a week after the school shooting at a Florida high school left 17 dead. Survivors of the shooting have focused much of their attention on GOP lawmakers who have received campaign contributions from the group. View the discussion thread.

NIST's National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence posted a notice on the Federal Register discussing the two initiatives, inviting technology vendors to participate in them. Both projects will use open-source technologies available on the market to develop methods aimed at countering ransomware threats. The first project, called the Identifying and Protecting Assets Against Ransomware and Other Destructive Events, will focus on developing technology methods to identify assets that could fall victim to ransomware attacks and protect them against such attacks. The second, called the Detecting and Responding to Ransomware and other Destructive Events, aims to develop methods to deal with ransomware attacks that do occur--to detect the ransomware and mitigate and contain damage from the attack. NIST is encouraging private technology vendors to participate in the collaboration.   A REPORT IN FOCUS:  MORE EMAIL SECURITY RESEARCH: New research indicates that the vast majority of federal information technology contractors have not implemented an email security tool that helps protect users from phishing attacks. According to a survey released this week by the Global Cyber Alliance, only one of the 50 top federal IT contractors for the federal government is using the anti-phishing tool at its strongest setting, known as the Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) last year mandated that federal agencies and departments operating .gov domains implement DMARC in order to crack down on fraudulent messages. The directive does not apply to federal contractors. When adopted, DMARC allows organizations to report emails that fail authentication tests and potentially block them from entering a recipient's inbox, if the strongest setting is enabled. Twenty-one of the federal contractors reviewed by the Global Cyber Alliance have implemented DMARC on the weakest setting, meaning that no action is being taken to block the fraudulent emails. or quarantine them to a recipient's spam folder. Homeland Security gave agencies and departments until mid-January to begin using the tool, though some appear to have missed that deadline. A study released Thursday by Valimail found that 68 percent of federal government agencies had implemented DMARC.   A LIGHTER CLICK:  Rough week? How about some bitcoin yoga.

1796046,Booker introducing bill to remove Confederate statues from Capitol | TheHill,"Sen. Cory BookerCory Anthony BookerEight Democratic presidential hopefuls to appear in CNN climate town hall Biden, Buttigieg bypassing Democratic delegate meeting: report F-bombs away: Why lawmakers are cursing now more than ever MORE (D-N.J.) will introduce a bill to remove Confederate statues from the Capitol following the violence at a white nationalist rally in Virginia. ""I will be introducing a bill to remove Confederate statues from the US Capitol building,"" he said on Twitter late Wednesday night.  Booker, one of three African-Americans currently serving in the Senate, added that removing the roughly 12 Confederate statues would be ""just one step. We have much work to do.""  I will be introducing a bill to remove Confederate statues from the US Capitol building. This is just one step. We have much work to do. A white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend began as a protest against the Charlottesville City Council’s decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.  But since the rally turned violent and led to the death of one counterprotester, other localities have moved to take down Confederate statues — and some lawmakers think the Capitol should consider following suit.  Booker didn't lay out a timeline for when he would introduce the legislation, which would need 60 votes to pass the upper chamber. The Senate is scheduled to return to Washington in early September.  Currently only states have the power to replace statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck SchumerCharles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerLewandowski on potential NH Senate run: If I run, 'I'm going to win' Appropriators warn White House against clawing back foreign aid Colorado candidates vying to take on Gardner warn Hickenlooper they won't back down MORE (D-N.Y.) threw his support behind Booker's forthcoming legislation, saying Democrats should ""work towards the goal"" of the bill while also continuing to ""denounce and resist President Trump for his reprehensible actions.” A spokesperson for Sen.

""He also believes the Senate needs to work to address the fundamental inequities in our society that have left African-Americans and families of color in this country with far less wealth, higher unemployment rates, fewer opportunities and less protection under the law.” Kaine's state would be impacted by the legislation if it passed.  Virginia, like every other state, currently has two statues included in the National Statuary Hall Collection. One of the state's statues is of Lee and is currently displayed in the Capitol's Crypt. The move could also have political repercussions for Kaine, whose state has been at the center of the debate on removing publicly displayed Confederate monuments.  Corey Stewart, who defended the Lee statue in Charlottesville during his failed Virginia gubernatorial bid, said earlier this year that he was considering challenging Kaine in next year's Senate race.  Also voicing support Thursday for the statues' removal was House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). “There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol or in places of honor across the country,” Pelosi said in a statement. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus have also revived their efforts to get the Confederate statues removed.  ""We will never solve America's race problem if we continue to honor traitors who fought against the United States in order to keep African-Americans in chains. By the way, thank God, they lost,” CBC Chairman Cedric Richmond (D-La.) told ABC News.

1796391,White House says Trump authority is supreme in agency fight | TheHill,"Senior White House officials insisted Saturday that President Trump is legally allowed to appoint an acting director for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which is an independent agency. Officials say Trump has the right to supersede an appointment by the exiting director. The officials called Trump’s appointment of Office of Management and Budget Director Mick MulvaneyJohn (Mick) Michael MulvaneyDick Cheney to attend fundraiser supporting Trump reelection: report Chris Wallace becomes Trump era's 'equal opportunity inquisitor' Appropriators warn White House against clawing back foreign aid MORE to lead the CFPB “a typical, routine move” in line with years of precedent.  Trump appointed Mulvaney on Friday night to serve as acting director of the CFPB, hours before former Director Richard Cordray left the agency. Cordray promoted his chief of staff Leandra English to the deputy director position before leaving. The conflicting appointments mean there are two people who can claim to be the acting director of one federal agency. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which established the CFPB, calls on the agency’s deputy director to serve as acting director until the president appoints and the Senate confirms a permanent replacement. But senior administration officials said Saturday that the Federal Vacancies Act of 1998 empowers Trump to override the CFPB’s line of succession with his own pick. The officials spoke to reporters during a Saturday call under the condition of anonymity. The Vacancies Act allows the president to appoint any Senate-confirmed officer as the acting director or secretary of a federal agency or department.  Legal experts say it’s unclear whether English or Mulvaney is the rightful director of the CFPB, but senior administration officials said years of precedent supported Trump’s decision. One senior administration official said the CFPB’s line of succession “continues to be available as a default,"" but that “the Vacancies Act is also there as a way that the president can supersede the way those agency statutes work.”  “The common objections that you hear in these various blog posts online is that ‘Oh, the CFPB statue said the CFPB deputy director shall serve as the director,' ” said the official. “That’s clear in lots of these statues that the Vacancies Act trumps.” The official said the White House consulted with the Office of Legal Counsel before nominating Mulvaney, and the office will likely release a brief supporting Trump’s move within the day. The official also said the White House doesn’t expect any legal issues with Mulvaney’s appointment, and didn’t expect it to derail the agency’s work. “I know it makes it a better story if things are unpleasant and there’s a clash of two directors, but I don’t think it’s [at] all clear that’s going to happen,” the official said. “I think there’s a very good chance that Director Mulvaney will come in on Monday morning and that will be end of things.” Even so, the official accused Cordray of starting a legal battle ""we’ve gone out of our way to avoid."" Despite the White House’ assurances, the dueling appointments have triggered widespread confusion among experts and concern among the CFPB’s regulated industries. Several groups aligned with Cordray's CFPB have insisted that Mulvaney step aside, while Trump's supporters have defended the president. English, a senior CFPB employee, would likely continue the agency’s aggressive enforcement actions and sweeping lending rules. Mulvaney, a staunch conservative who once called the CFPB “a sick, sad joke” would likely freeze or significantly change the agency’s current agenda. Mulvaney will also have to balance overseeing the CFPB while working with lawmakers to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling before the end of 2017. Failing to do so could risk a government shutdown or the United States defaulting on its debt. The other administration official expressed no concerns that Mulvaney’s role at CFPB would detract from his responsibilities as OMB director. The official said Trump picked Mulvaney because of his work in Congress on the House Financial Services Committee, his budget experience and previous Senate confirmation. View the discussion thread.

1803343,Les Moonves exits as head of CBS | TheHill,"CBS Chairman and CEO Leslie Moonves resigned from his role ""effective immediately"" on Sunday amid fresh allegations of sexual misconduct, the company announced in a press release. CBS announced the move Sunday, hours after The New Yorker published a second story detailing allegations that Moonves harassed female employees and coerced one woman into performing oral sex. As part of his departure, Moonves and CBS will donate $20 million to one or more organizations that support the #MeToo movement, which supports women who have been victims of sexual harassment or sexual assault. The donation will be deducted from any severance benefits that Moonves would have received upon his departure, CBS said in a press release. Chief Operating Officer Joseph Ianniello will replace Moonves on an acting basis while the company's board of directors searches for a permanent successor, the network said. The company did not rule out the possibility of Moonves receiving future benefits, stating that such a payment ""will depend on the results of the independent investigation and subsequent Board investigation."" In a statement obtained by Variety, Moonves spoke fondly of his time leading CBS, and called the allegations against him ""untrue,"" and ""not consistent with who I am."" ""I am deeply saddened to be leaving the company,"" Moonves said. ""I wish nothing but the best for the organization, the newly comprised board of directors and all of its employees.” The announcement arrived as the network was reportedly negotiating Moonves's exit and a possible settlement. The New Yorker's Ronan Farrow published a report in July in which six women accused Moonves of sexual harassment, with four describing forced touching or kissing, and dozens of other employees detailing a culture of gender discrimination. Moonves denied allegations of sexual assault or intimidation at the time, but acknowledged trying to kiss an actress and writer working for the network. The network appointed an independent investigator to look into the allegations, but did not take further action against Moonves at the time. On Sunday, Farrow published a follow-up piece in which six more women accused Moonves of exposing himself, threatening their careers or, in one case, forcing a woman to perform oral sex. Moonves, in a statement to The New Yorker, admitted to three of the sexual encounters, but insisted they were all consensual. Moonves is the latest major media industry figure to step down amid allegations of sexual assault or harassment.

1807760,NJ couple and homeless man who raised hundreds of thousands on GoFundMe accused of making up story to scam people | TheHill,"A New Jersey couple who raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for a homeless good Samaritan in an online fundraiser last year actually plotted with the man to make up a “fictitious story,” prosecutors say. Mark D’Amico and Kate McClure appeared to create a GoFundMe campaign in an effort to assist homeless Marine veteran Johnny Bobbitt Jr., when actually all three were in on the plan to trick unsuspecting donors, according to a complaint filed in court obtained by NBC News. The three accumulated more than $402,000 in donations from more than 14,000 people. They were able to trick the donors by preventing donors from acquiring information about the campaign and its background and “failing to correct their story,” according to the complaint. The story began last fall, when it was reported McClure’s car ran out of gas in Philadelphia and she was assisted by Bobbitt, who at the time was homeless. Bobbitt reportedly gave McClure his last $20, and she repaid him by setting up a GoFundMe account for him with D’Amico. Bobbitt’s kind deed became a viral sensation and spurred the hundreds of thousands in donations. But it was later reported that the couple was withholding the funds from Bobbitt and that he was still drug-addicted and living on the streets. Bobbitt accused the couple of withholding the money from him and using it as a ""personal piggy bank."" Bobbitt’s attorney alleged the couple spent some of the money on a BMW and luxury vacations. Bobbitt sued, and in August, a judge ordered the couple to turn over all remaining money that had been donated. All three are now facing charges including conspiracy and theft by deception. A lawyer for the couple had no comment Thursday and an attorney for Bobbitt could not immediately be reached for comment, according to NBC News. View the discussion thread.

1810674,9/11 Commission leaders: Time for a new strategy to stop spread of violent extremism | TheHill,"After nearly two decades, the global fight against terrorism has reached a critical phase. The eviction of the Islamic State from territory it once held in Iraq and Syria and the beginning of negotiations in Afghanistan are significant achievements. Yet these tactical victories should not be construed as strategic success. We are defeating terrorists, but extremism thrives. To declare victory now would only condemn us to repeat history – sending our troops to fight in foreign lands when the terrorist threat resurfaces. And resurface it will. Despite the courage and skill of our military, intelligence, diplomatic, and development professionals, since 2001, the number of Salafi-jihadist groups has more than doubled; their membership has tripled; and they are present in more countries than ever. To stop endless wars and to protect America a new approach is needed – one that seeks to prevent extremism from taking root in the first place by addressing the conditions that enable it to spread. To address this need, Congress tasked the U.S. Institute of Peace to “develop a comprehensive plan to prevent the underlying causes of extremism in fragile states.” We were honored to lead this effort. We worked with a bipartisan Task Force comprised of fifteen talented foreign policy and private sector professionals. All of us understand the importance of the problem as well as the difficulty of a solution. Our principal recommendation is both simple and daunting: we need a high-level political commitment to prevention. Our goal should not be to topple governments or install new ones, but to strengthen vulnerable states and societies so that they can better defend themselves. Open-ended military intervention and nation-building are neither effective nor sustainable. Prevention is a counterterrorism policy for the long haul.  The challenge is not that we lack the tools for preventing extremism. We have capabilities and expertise spread across the government. Rather, our past efforts have been disjointed, piecemeal, and lacking in urgency. To successfully get ahead of the extremist threat, we must align, coordinate and prioritize prevention. First, we must bring to an end political disagreements over the nature of terrorism. Nearly two decades of research and experience make clear that, while the specific factors that drive individuals to violence vary widely, extremism is fundamentally a political, economic, and ideological challenge. Extremists’ attempts, in the Middle East and Africa, to establish an absolutist state ruled by a rigid and twisted interpretation of Islam resonate most in societies where the existing state has failed its people. Stopping extremists from exploiting grievances, provoking instability, and establishing themselves in fragile states thus requires strengthening and reforging the contract between citizens and their government. This, however, is not a task for the U.S.. Rather the U.S. should adopt a government-wide focus on identifying, encouraging, and building partnerships with leaders in fragile states – nationally and locally, in government and civil society, with women, youth, and the private sector – who are committed to improving the political conditions in their states and societies. Second, building and sustaining such partnerships, particularly in environments as challenging as fragile states, will require coordinated engagement. That is why we recommend that Congress should authorize and fund, and the Executive Branch implement, a Strategic Prevention Initiative to give U.S. agencies the resources, and authorities they need to operationalize this shared framework for the long haul. In particular, government agencies would benefit from a clearer division of responsibility, more flexible-longer term funding and robust efforts to ensure that all assistance, including security cooperation, is aligned with efforts to address extremism. Finally, the U.S. need not – and should not – shoulder the burden of preventing extremism alone. Other countries are also menaced by the continued spread of extremism and are spending significant resources to confront the threat. We should ensure that these efforts are coordinated in pursuit of the same objectives. Therefore, we recommend that the U.S. use its unparalled convening power to launch a Partnership Development Fund, a vehicle to rally and align international political support and resources behind a prevention strategy. With this strategy in place, rather than create dependent clients, we can strengthen the sovereignty of weak states and the resilience of vulnerable communities so they can withsatand extremist onslaughts. If we help leaders govern inclusively, empower women, and create opportunities for youth, the next time the Islamic State attempts to establish a caliphate, it will be the people, and not our troops, who will turn them away. This is the right moment for a new approach. The Islamic State’s weakening creates an opportunity to get ahead of the threat; an opportunity we must seize. We must not only defeat today’s terrorists but also alleviate the conditions that spawn tomorrow’s. Our policy should be prevention. Our future security depends on it. Thomas H. Kean co-chairs the United States Institute of Peace Task Force on Extremism in Fragile States and the Bipartisan Policy Center’s National Security Program. He served as governor of New Jersey from 1982 to 1990 and was the president of Drew University from 1990 to 2005. Kean also served as chairman of the 9/11 Commission from 2002 to 2004. Lee H.

Carbon, a major greenhouse gas contributor, is projected to increase in the atmosphere by more than 2 percent in 2018 following nearly three years of no growth, a study by the Global Carbon Project found. The increase in emissions are largely tied to the output of the fossil fuel industry, which has increased every decade since the 1960s. The burning of coal, oil and gas were the top contributors to carbon emissions last year, the study found. With coal contributing 40 percent of the climate change linked emissions globally. China was the largest contributor to emissions last year at 27 percent, with the U.S. following it at 15 percent and the 28 countries within the European Union at 10 percent, according to the report. The findings follow closely behind a federal report that in late November sounded the alarm on the growing impact of climate change. The report, the first of its kind released under the Trump administration, found that climate change is expected to interrupt the way people live day-to-day as it ravages infrastructure, impacts human health, poses challenges to the global economy and threatens the world's energy supply.   Read more.   EPA EYES ANOTHER COAL RULE ROLLBACK: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is expected to formally propose rolling back an Obama administration climate change rule for coal-fired power plants. The rule at issue, written in 2015, would have put strict new limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal plants. Emissions from such plants would have to be at a similar level to what plants would achieve with carbon capture and storage (CCS), a technology that is not generally commercially used. The Trump administration this week will propose to significantly weaken the rule while keeping some form of it in place, in part as an effort to make new coal plants easier to build, two people familiar with the plans said. Axios was first to report the regulatory plan. The rollback is not likely to spur many new coal-fired power plants. Coal has been in a multiyear decline, due not just to regulations, but also competition from natural gas and renewables.

1821343,Report: National security panel clears T-Mobile-Sprint merger | TheHill,"A national security panel has approved the proposed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal on Monday. The move helps push the deal closer to final approval, though the companies still need a sign-off from the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice. According to the Journal, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) approved the merger on Monday.   But according to the Journal, CFIUS’ approval is not resting on any such conditions, though national security officials have pressured companies to sever ties with Huawei, which is believed to have inextricable ties to the governing Communist Party in China. Both Sprint and T-Mobile are controlled by foreign firms. The German Deutshe Telekom AG owns a controlling stake in T-Mobile and Sprint is owned by the Japanese firm SoftBank. Neither company responded to requests for comment. A Treasury spokesperson for CFIUS declined to confirm the report, citing a legal obligation not to reveal any information about the panel’s reviews. “By law, information filed with CFIUS may not be disclosed by CFIUS to the public,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “Accordingly, the Department does not comment on information relating to specific CFIUS cases, including whether or not certain parties have filed notices for review.” View the discussion thread.

1823499,Senate panel again looks to force Trump’s hand on cyber warfare strategy | TheHill,"A Senate panel is attempting again to dictate a cyber policy strategy — even after the Trump administration submitted its own, classified strategy to Congress last month. The Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday approved a new version of the annual defense policy bill, formally known as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), 25-2. The panel's version would set a cyber warfare doctrine stating that the United States will use “all instruments of national power” — including military force and offensive digital operations — to counter cyberattacks that deliberately threaten American lives or critical infrastructure. The bill also would make it U.S. policy to “employ all instruments of national power, including the use of offensive cyber capabilities, to deter if possible, and respond when necessary, to cyber attacks that target U.S. interests with the intent to cause casualties, significantly disrupt the normal functioning of our democratic society or government, threaten the Armed Forces or the critical infrastructure they rely upon, achieve an effect comparable to an armed attack, or imperil a U.S. vital interest,” according to a bipartisan summary released Thursday afternoon.  Lawmakers on the committee have increasingly raised alarm over the threat of cyberattacks, particularly in the wake of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Many have also expressed frustration with successive administrations on having no comprehensive strategy for deterring and responding to attacks in the cyber realm.  “The lack of decisive and clearly articulated consequences to cyberattacks against our country has served as an open invitation to foreign adversaries and malicious cyber actors to continue attacking the United States,” a bipartisan group of senators wrote to Trump in March.  A similar provision was included in the version of the NDAA approved by the committee last year. That provision never made it into the final bill after the Trump administration objected to it. Instead, the 2018 legislation instructed President TrumpDonald John TrumpFacebook releases audit on conservative bias claims Harry Reid: 'Decriminalizing border crossings is not something that should be at the top of the list' Recessions happen when presidents overlook key problems MORE to submit a cyber warfare strategy to Congress — which he did last month.

1823955,Anti-sanctuary state measure qualifies for Oregon ballot | TheHill,"Voters in Oregon are set to decide whether to repeal the state’s ""sanctuary"" policies for undocumented immigrants after activists gathered enough signatures to force an initiative for November’s ballot. The measure would repeal a statute passed in 1987 that prohibits state law enforcement agencies from arresting someone solely for violating federal immigration law. It would allow state law enforcement agencies to verify the immigration status of anyone arrested for a criminal offense and work with federal immigration agencies. Supporters of the group Oregonians for Immigration Reform submitted more than 97,000 valid signatures, well over the 88,184 required to make the ballot, according to the Secretary of State’s office. “Across the state, hundreds of grassroots Oregonians worked to gather the signatures of tens of thousands of voters,” the group’s president, Cynthia Kendoll, said in a statement. “All are eager to end Oregon’s sanctuary policy and see their state do its part to combat, not promote, illegal immigration.”  The group, which is listed as an anti-immigrant hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, has won political fights in Oregon before. They organized against a 2014 ballot measure that would have allowed undocumented immigrants to receive driver’s licenses, an initiative that lost by almost a two-to-one margin. The measure is backed by three Republican state representatives who represent rural districts. Business and community groups started organizing against the initiative even before supporters filed their petitions. An opposition umbrella group, Oregonians United Against Profiling, counts businesses like Nike and Columbia Sportswear Company, the American Civil Liberties Union and the state Democratic Party as opponents of the measure. “Oregon’s existing ‘sanctuary’ law has been protecting Oregonians from unfair racial profiling for 30+ years. No Oregonian, including those who may be undocumented immigrants, should have to live in fear of harassment or their families being torn apart,” the group said in a tweet earlier this month. Oregon’s existing ‘sanctuary’ law has been protecting Oregonians from unfair racial profiling for 30+ years. No Oregonian, including those who may be undocumented immigrants, should have to live in fear of harassment or their families being torn apart. Oregon is one of three states, along with Illinois and California, and dozens of cities and counties that the Justice Department has designated as sanctuary jurisdictions that limit or preclude cooperation with federal immigration officials. The Justice Department in January sought records from nearly two dozen jurisdictions, including Oregon, relating to their sanctuary policies. View the discussion thread.

1824725,Trump administration releases funding for Syria's 'White Helmets' | TheHill,"The United States will release some $6.6 million in previously frozen funding for a humanitarian aid group in Syria, the State Department announced Thursday. The move comes over a month after the Trump administration froze funding for the Syrian Civil Defense – known as the ""White Helmets"" – a group of volunteer first-responders that provides aid to war-ravaged areas of Syria.  The funding, which comes from the State Department and USAID, is intended to help provide the White Helmets with equipment, vehicles and other resources.  In the past, the U.S. has typically provided about a third of the White Helmets' funding. The decision to release the funding came a day after the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international chemical weapons watchdog, determined that sarin and chlorine were very likely used in a pair of chemical attacks in northern Syria in 2017. Part of the funding will also go to the United Nation's International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism, which is charged with investigating and prosecuting crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. President TrumpDonald John TrumpFacebook releases audit on conservative bias claims Harry Reid: 'Decriminalizing border crossings is not something that should be at the top of the list' Recessions happen when presidents overlook key problems MORE ordered the State Department in March to freeze $200 million in recovery funds for Syria as he weighs the future of the United States' role in the country. In addition to providing humanitarian aid, the U.S. has also been working to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), though American troops have primarily been working in advisory roles. In March, Trump declared that the U.S. ""would be coming out of Syria very soon,"" foreshadowing a possible withdrawal from the country, which has been ravaged by civil war for more than seven years. He has also suggested that other countries in the Middle East should contribute more to Syria. View the discussion thread.

The rates of sea level rise have increased rapidly over the last century and are projected to consume many American cities’ infrastructure by mid-century. We won’t be able to adapt through engineering. Nor can we rely on the power of Paris-type climate talks, particular policies in America, or the proof behind climate science and data.  It’s often assumed that this will move the dial — that the fight is mostly about securing voluntary carbon-cutting contributions from each country or persuading the few remaining media holdouts to report accurately on climate science. But a conversation among a select few won’t bring the change we desperately need to slow those rapidly rising seas. There are at least six other ways, mentioned below, the climate community could ramp up its engagement. We need more money, “me” time, and a moderate majority, as well as more common sense, charismatic messengers and a better message. Let’s deal with the money factor first. It’s no secret that the fossil fuel industry heavily lobbies Congress with well over $150 million. Renewable industries are spending less than one-seventh of what fossil fuel is forking out. This equation has to change if the sustainable fuel sector wants to make itself heard. Second, we need more “me” time. There’s much to be done on a personal level, such as moving off meat to more plant-based diets (since one unit of meat protein uses 150 times the greenhouse gas emissions that one unit of soy protein uses) and off heavily polluting and petroleum-dependent “fast fashion” that speeds up production and marketing of clothing. Environmentalists need to lead by example and others will follow, especially when they see that carbon-light lifestyles — such as veggie-based diets — also make you a healthier human. Third, it’s time to engage the moderate majority which, by every polling measure, is on board with the idea that humans contribute to climate change but hasn’t meaningfully changed behavior. This middle of America isn’t tracking climate talks, isn’t following the environmental legal battles and isn’t reading the financial pages. We need to go to them.  The conversation about climate action has to take place on and in mass media and in multiple languages. We know where Americans are overwhelmingly getting their news — on outlets such as CBS, NBC and ABC News. If we’re not on those airwaves, we’re not being heard. Fourth, Americans across the political spectrum want policies that make both common sense and fiscal sense. So the primary climate message going forward should be: There’s money to be made and saved in this energy transition. Energy efficiency makes economic sense. Renewables make economic sense. Health benefits from climate action make economic sense. So the primary climate message going forward should be: There’s money to be made and saved in this energy transition. Let’s do it. Fifth, we need more charismatic messengers and evangelists in order to build this movement. Various mayors and governors have impressive 2050 targets and timelines. CEOs and celebrities have also made climate change a priority and should be more visible. Hopefully, they will see the dire circumstances and become the campaigners the climate community needs. Sixth, we need a different way to tell our story. “Energy independence” was once touted as the go-to narrative for many climate advocates.  The idea was simple: Let’s get off petrol state dependence and reliance as it’s too volatile and comes with too much security and market risk. While America is achieving energy independence, we’re now producing more oil and gas than ever before, all under the “energy independence” rubric. Instead, we should promote the “democratization of energy” — our right to harness the sun and the wind and to be free of utility control. Even libertarians might like that idea. Going forward, we can’t continue to rely primarily on elite climate talks, discreet policy and scientific evidence. We need money, messengers, mainstream approaches and more. And we need them now.

1827896,Older Americans much more likely to favor ‘tougher’ foreign policy | TheHill,"   The American public favors President TrumpDonald John TrumpFacebook releases audit on conservative bias claims Harry Reid: 'Decriminalizing border crossings is not something that should be at the top of the list' Recessions happen when presidents overlook key problems MORE getting “tougher” in his policies toward multiple foreign powers, according to a new Hill.TV poll. In a new American Barometer survey, a majority of 1,000 registered voters said they wanted the United States to “be tougher” in its relations with Saudi Arabia, Iran, North Korea, China, and Russia. While there were some partisan differences in the survey, the bigger dividing line appears to be age, with younger voters much more interested in maintaining the status quo or drawing closer to the nations than older voters. Among respondents who were between the ages of 18 and 34, North Korea was the only country toward which a majority wanted to see a “tougher” foreign policy. Strong majorities of voters between 50 and 64 years old and those older than 65 favor more strident American foreign policy. Iran was the most unpopular among those over the age of 65, with 81 percent of respondents saying they wanted the U.S. to get “tougher” toward the Middle Eastern nation. North Korea was the most unpopular among voters between the ages of 50 and 64, with a strong majority of 75 percent saying they wanted a “tougher” policy toward the isolated Asian country. Voters between the ages of 35 and 49 were almost evenly split in dealing with the five countries. A majority wanted a “tougher” policy toward Iran, North Korea, and Russia while a majority wanted to keep relations the same or make them closer with regard to China and Saudi Arabia. The American relationship toward the Saudis has come under strain in recent weeks after the country’s monarchy was accused of kidnapping and murdering Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who became a permanent resident of the U.S. after he criticized Saudi policy. Since emerging as a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump has been a frequent critic the Iraq war and American involvement in the Middle East. As president, Trump has also accused Democrats of trying to start a war in Syria. Due to his lack of experience in political office, some Trump critics believed he might start large armed conflicts. “I think going into the presidency, I heard a lot in focus groups people being worried that he would start a war, start a war. And I think the longer we go without him starting a war, people sort of relax a little bit,” Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg said Monday on Hill.TV’s public opinion show “What's America Thinking.” In the American Barometer survey, Republicans were much more aggressive toward Iran, which Trump has made a frequent target during his short political career. Seventy-nine percent of self-identified GOP voters said they wanted a more bellicose foreign policy toward Iran. A smaller majority of Democratic voters, 52 percent, said they wanted the same. Among independents, 61 percent favored “tougher” relations with Iran. Partisans were split on the subject of relations with China, with 61 percent of Republicans favoring more pugnacious relations toward the country in comparison to just 41 percent of Democrats. Trump has also made China a frequent target of criticism, accusing it of “stealing” American jobs and manufacturing and benefitting unfairly from global trade policies. Self-identified independents were in the middle with 49 percent wanting “tougher” policies and 51 percent wanting to keep things with Beijing the same or closer. In regards to U.S. dealings with Russia, the survey found comparatively little partisan disagreement with 61 percent of Republicans and 62 percent of Democrats wanting more hard-line policies. Voters who identified themselves as “moderate” were less interested in having the U.S. get “tougher” with Moscow, but tougher policies still see 55 percent support. The American Barometer survey was conducted online between Oct. 13 and 14 among 1,000 registered voters by HarrisX. The sampling margin of error of the poll is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. —Matthew Sheffield  An overwhelming majority of voters are concerned that the U.S. will enter a recession in 2020, according to a Hill-HarrisX poll released Monday. A majority of Republican voters -- 62 percent -- identify as both fiscally and socially conservative, according to a new Hill-HarrisX poll released on Friday. More than half of voters would not consider reelecting President Trump in 2020, according to a new poll released on Thursday. Top-tier candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Two-thirds of voters said in a poll released Tuesday that President Trump’s next round of China tariffs will increase prices on U.S. consumer goods. Mental illness, weak gun laws and hateful public rhetoric are largely to blame for mass shootings in the United States, according to a new Hill-HarrisX poll. Just over half of Republicans — 51 percent — said in a new Hill-HarrisX poll that the federal deficit is a problem that the government needs to deal with immediately.  Less than half of U.S. voters trust companies headquartered in Mexico and China, according to a new Hill-HarrisX poll. President Trump’s job approval rating has dropped six points among voters between the ages of 18 and 34 in the latest Hill-HarrisX poll. A plurality of voters — 44 percent — say they think President Trump responds more fiercely to critics who aren’t white, according to a Hill-HarrisX poll released on Tuesday. Almost half of voters polled — 47 percent — say there was no clear winner from last week’s Democratic presidential primary debate in Detroit, according to a new Hill-HarrisX poll. Twenty-seven percent of Americans said that they thought the latest two-year budget deal would have no impact on their financial situation, according to a new poll out Friday. Support for impeachment proceedings against President Trump has slipped among Democratic voters following special counsel Robert Mueller’s public testimony before Congress last week, according to a poll released on Thursday.

1830695,White woman charged with assaulting black teen at swimming pool | TheHill,"A white woman dubbed “Pool Patrol Paula” on social media has been charged with assaulting a black teenager at a community pool in South Carolina. Stephenie Sebby-Strempel, 38, allegedly confronted a 15-year-old boy and his friends at a community pool in Summerville, S.C., on Sunday, CBS affiliate WCSC reported. Sebby-Strempel reportedly told them they “didn’t belong” there and had to leave, according to the incident report. The teenagers began collecting their things and started to leave, a victim told police. Sebby-Strempel, however, allegedly began calling them “punks” and using racial slurs. The incident was captured on video and was posted to Facebook by user Rhe Capers on Sunday. It has been viewed more than 1 million times as of Friday morning.  The video shows Sebby-Strempel threatening to call the police and telling the teenagers to “get out!” It appears to also show her reaching for the camera before the video abruptly cuts off. She allegedly struck the teenager at least three times.  Sebby-Strempel was later charged with one count of third-degree assault and battery and two counts of assaulting, beating or wounding a police officer while resisting arrest, according to court documents. When Dorchester County Sheriff’s Office detectives attempted to serve Sebby-Strempel with an arrest warrant on Monday, she allegedly bit one detective and pushed another into the wall, WCSC reported. A judge set a surety bond of $65,000 on Tuesday for Sebby-Strempel.  She is also prohibited from contacting the victims in any way, including electronically. The victim’s mother, Deanna RocQuermore, told the outlet that the incident should have never happened. The victims told CBS they do not live in the community where the pool was located but were invited to use the pool by someone who does. “No child including mine or anybody else’s ever, ever, deserves that type of abuse or treatment,"" RocQuermore said. “And to be struck not once, not twice, but three times by someone that is upset because of the color of someone’s skin, and they don’t belong at their swimming pool.” She also applauded her son for showing self-control during the altercation. “I think in this situation — he’s seen how these situations go. We’ve seen exactly the opposite of what could happen if you attempt to defend yourself or act in any way that could be perceived as defending yourself,”  his attorney Marvin Pendarvis said. Sebby-Strempel’s attorney said at her bail hearing on Tuesday that there are two sides to every story. CBS News reported that Sebby-Strempel has been terminated as an independent consultant with skincare company Rodan + Fields. ""After assessing statements from law enforcement and determining that this former Independent Consultant's actions violate our policies, she is no longer affiliated with Rodan + Fields,” the company said in a statement. The video sparked outrage online, the latest in a series of widely publicized incidents caught on video.  Two black men were arrested in a Philadelphia Starbucks in April for sitting in the cafe without ordering anything. A white resident nicknamed online as “Barbecue Becky” called police on a black family who were setting up a charcoal grill in a public park. A viral video from earlier this month showed a white woman dubbed “Permit Patty” calling 911 on a black girl selling bottled water in San Francisco. View the discussion thread.

1830808,"One year in, Trump’s tax law faces test with filing season | TheHill","President TrumpDonald John TrumpFacebook releases audit on conservative bias claims Harry Reid: 'Decriminalizing border crossings is not something that should be at the top of the list' Recessions happen when presidents overlook key problems MORE signed his much-anticipated tax overhaul bill into law on Dec. 22, 2017. One year later, it has fallen short of GOP expectations on several fronts. Politically, the tax-cut law was expected to help at the polls, where House Republicans ended up losing their majority during the November midterm elections. Republicans had hoped the law would become more popular after the IRS updated its withholding tables in early 2018, but polls consistently showed that many taxpayers either didn’t notice more money in their paychecks or they thought the tax cuts benefited corporations and wealthy Americans more than everyone else. The next key test for the law will come early next year, when taxpayers start filing their returns under the new code for the first time. Republicans are hopeful that’s when voters will view the law in a new, more positive light. “I think come January through April, they’re going to see tangible tax relief,” said Rep. Kevin BradyKevin Patrick BradyRepublicans' rendezvous with reality — their plan is to cut Social Security The Social Security 2100 Act is critical for millennials and small business owners House panel releases documents of presidential tax return request before Trump MORE (R-Texas), the outgoing chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. Democrats, on the other hand, are worried that some taxpayers who are expecting refunds will end up owing money, or that they will receive smaller refunds than they budgeted for. “It’s going to be a hit and a surprise to a lot of them,” said Rep. John Larson John  Barry LarsonThe Social Security 2100 Act is critical for millennials and small business owners Warren introduces universal child care legislation Unchain seniors from chained inflation index MORE (D-Conn.), a member of the Ways and Means panel. The tax law is considered the GOP’s signature legislative accomplishment during the first two years of Trump’s presidency. Its main provisions include lower tax rates across-the-board for individuals, slashing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and a 20 percent deduction for income from noncorporate businesses. Republicans last year touted the overhaul as a middle-class tax cut that would boost the U.S. economy. They have also argued that the tax cuts will pay for themselves. Economists across the political spectrum disagree with the notion that the tax cuts won't add to the deficit, and the federal deficit has increased since the law’s passage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated in April that the law will add about $1.9 trillion to the deficit from 2018 to 2028. Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that from a fiscal perspective, the tax law was a “major mistake.” Economic growth has been strong in 2018, and is on track to hit Republicans’ desired goal of 3 percent for the year. ""Tax cuts and regulatory relief actions by the Trump Administration have led to more investment in America, strong economic growth, higher wages, and more Americans going back to work,"" Treasury Secretary Steven MnuchinSteven Terner MnuchinFive key players in Trump's trade battles Pelosi warns Mnuchin to stop 'illegal' .3B cut to foreign aid Trump phoned bank CEOs as stock market plunged Wednesday: report MORE said in a statement Friday. Business groups that pushed for the tax-cut law continue to argue it has been beneficial to the economy. “From the beginning, the Chamber said it would judge any tax reform plan on whether or not it would spur economic growth and benefit the American people,” said Caroline Harris, vice president for tax policy and economic development at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “Based on that standard, tax reform is working.” But it’s unclear whether the law will provide a long-term benefit to the economy. White House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett said on a call with reporters this week that the tax law is meeting the administration’s economic expectations, and he thinks growth will be sustained. “The people who said we couldn't have 3 percent growth last year are saying it about next year, and I think that they're as incorrect now as they were last year,” he said. The Federal Reserve estimates growth will fall below 3 percent next year. “I think we should expect the economy will slow. The question is, to what?” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the right-leaning American Action Forum. He said the question is whether growth rates will return to their pre-tax law levels or slow more modestly. Democrats have highlighted that corporations spent more money in the past year on repurchasing their own shares than on wage increases and bonuses for employees. But analysts who are supportive of the law say it will take time for the tax cuts to show up as increased productivity and higher wages. While the long-term economic effects remain to be seen, it’s clear the tax cuts weren't the political asset that Republicans hoped they would be in the 2018 midterm elections. While most people in all income groups are expected to receive a tax cut for their 2018 income under the law, higher earners are expected to see the greatest increases in their after-tax incomes. Democrats and progressive groups have hammered home that point. “We demonstrated that when people were shown what the tax bill did, they recognized it for what it was and they did not fall for the GOP spin,” said Maura Quint, executive director of Tax March. Republicans are hopeful that voters will ultimately warm to the tax law when they file their taxes next year. Most of the law’s changes to the tax code for individuals take effect for the 2018 tax year, with the filing season on tap for early 2019. Democrats, on the other hand, say they are worried taxpayers will receive an unwelcome surprise and have to pay the IRS money in the spring, due to the new withholding guidance and the fact that many people didn’t update their withholding this year. A group of Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee introduced a bill last week that would protect taxpayers from penalties next year if they did not have enough taxes withheld from their paychecks. The Treasury Department has estimated that under the new withholding guidance, 73 percent of taxpayers with wages will get refunds next year, compared to 76 percent if prior laws had still been in place. A survey by H&R Block found that 47 percent of respondents think they will see bigger refunds next year. “In aggregate, we expect that people’s tax rates are going down, their tax liabilities are going down, but how that manifests in tax refunds will be very specific to one’s individual circumstances,” said Kathy Pickering, executive director of H&R Block’s tax institute. Pickering said the taxpayers most at risk for having decreased refunds next year are homeowners in high-tax states, those with unreimbursed business expenses and people who itemize deductions and don’t have dependents. In the coming year, House Democrats plan to hold hearings on the tax law, but they're unlikely to get any rollback legislation through the GOP-controlled Senate. And Democratic presidential candidates for 2020 are likely to propose eliminating parts of the law to show how they would pay for their various domestic policy proposals. “I think that taxes are going to be very big in the presidential campaign,” said Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness.

1836252,Trump administration asks Supreme Court to hear DACA case ahead of appeals courts | TheHill,"The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to preemptively step into the legal fights over its decision to end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and decide this term whether the move was lawful. Solicitor Noel Francisco filed a petition with the court on Monday asking the justices to hear their case and issue an opinion before the 2nd, 9th and D.C. Circuit courts of appeals have ruled. In February, the Supreme Court denied the government’s request to hear its appeal of a district court’s order forcing the government to maintain the DACA program ahead of the 9th Circuit's review. The justices said then that they assumed the appeals court would proceed expeditiously. Francisco told the court Monday “that has not happened.” “Although the court of appeals heard oral argument on May 15, 2018, it has yet to issue its decision,” he said. “And while no one, respondents included, contends that the legality of DACA’s rescission will be finally resolved without this Court’s review, absent prompt intervention from this Court, there is little chance the Court would resolve this dispute for at least another year.” The Department of Homeland Security announced in September 2017 it is winding down the program, which protects young people who came to the country illegally as children. Francisco said the New York-based 2nd Circuit, the D.C. Circuit and the California-based 9th Circuit all have lower court rulings before them that conclude the rescission of DACA is likely unlawful. He said those decisions are wrong. The challengers in those cases have argued the administration’s decision flouted notice and comment rulemaking requirements, was arbitrary and capricious and denied so-called Dreamers equal protection and due process of law. But the government argues that the Department of Homeland Security has concluded the DACA policy is unlawful and risks being invalidated by a separate multistate lawsuit led by Texas challenging the Obama-era policy. --Updated 7:20 p.m. View the discussion thread.

1839003,Timeline: Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court | TheHill,"Brett Kavanaugh appeared to be a lock for the Supreme Court for much of the summer before his nomination was thrown into question last month by allegations of sexual misconduct going back to his high school days in the early 1980s. The allegations brought forward by Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford, followed by two other women, roiled an already contentious confirmation battle over Kavanaugh's views on abortion, presidential power and individual liberty. The months-long effort, buoyed on both sides by millions of dollars in spending from outside groups, came to a dramatic head when both Kavanaugh and Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in a rollercoaster hearing Sept. 27.

Immediately, rumors about Trump's replacement for the swing vote justice begin to swirl in Washington, as the president pledged during the 2016 campaign to nominate conservative justices who would support causes long sought by the right, such as overturning Roe v. Wade. July 9: Trump taps Kavanaugh  Less than two weeks after Kennedy's announcement, Trump makes his decision on a replacement by nominating Kavanaugh, a 12-year veteran of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Kavanaugh, a former clerk of Kennedy's, was long seen as the front-runner to succeed his former boss on the court. “If confirmed by the Senate, I will keep an open mind in every case,” Kavanaugh said at the time.

Other concerns over his views on Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that legalized a woman's right to an abortion, also persist. Aug. 20: Feinstein meets with Kavanaugh Kavanaugh meets with Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, to discuss his nomination to the Supreme Court. During the meeting, Feinstein does not bring up the confidential letter written to her by Ford. Aug. 22: Dems press for delay in Kavanaugh hearing Democrats, including Feinstein, call for Kavanaugh's hearings before the Judiciary Committee to be delayed following a claim from longtime Trump lawyer Michael Cohen in court documents that Trump ordered payments to be made during the 2016 election to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, two women who have said they had affairs with Trump in 2006. Republicans refuse the Democratic plea. Sept. 4-7: Confirmation hearings kick off Kavanaugh appears on Capitol Hill for confirmation hearings. During the hearings, he is questioned by Democrats on his views of presidential power, judicial precedent and the possibility of a conservative Supreme Court overturning the landmark abortion case Roe v.

Sept. 12: Reports begin to surface of accuser's letter Five days after the end of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, progressive news outlet The Intercept details reports from ""multiple sources"" of the letter sent by Ford to Feinstein detailing her sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh, though Ford's name does not appear in the article. Sept. 13: Feinstein says she sent letter to FBI Feinstein acknowledges the letter's existence, and says in a brief statement that she has sent the information to the FBI, which at that time had already completed its background check into Kavanaugh. Sept. 16: Ford comes forward in The Washington Post Ford comes forward publicly with her allegation in an interview with The Washington Post, detailing an alleged incident at a high school party in 1982 during which she says Kavanaugh held her down on a bed, muffling her screams for help with his hand and forcibly groping her while trying to remove her clothes. Kavanaugh denies the accusation in a statement from the White House. Sept. 23: Second Kavanaugh accuser emerges A second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, comes forward in an interview with The New Yorker detailing an accusation of sexual misconduct dating back to her time at Yale University with Kavanaugh. The judge denies the allegation, but several Democratic senators release statements demanding that the White House rescind his nomination. Sept. 26: Avenatti reveals statement of third accuser A day before the Senate Judiciary Committee is set to have a special session to hear from Kavanaugh and Ford over her allegations of assault, attorney Michael Avenatti reveals the identity of a third woman, Julie Swetnick, who alleges that the judge was present for ""gang rapes"" at high school parties in the 1980s. Kavanaugh calls the claims ""ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone."" Sept. 27: Kavanaugh, Ford testify in dramatic hearing Ford details her allegation against Kavanaugh in an emotional session before the Senate Judiciary Committee, during which she says she is ""100 percent"" certain that it was Kavanaugh who sexually assaulted her. Kavanaugh responds in his own testimony later in the day, at times becoming angry and breaking into tears as he defended himself against the allegations from Ford, Ramirez and Swetnick.

1839290,Ex-Capitol Hill aide shares political lessons from soccer | TheHill,"A veteran of Capitol Hill and a former Obama appointee says congressional staffers could improve their legislative game simply by kicking around a soccer ball. “Everybody has access to information all the time. You don’t have time to think and reflect, which really looks a lot like soccer,” Peter Loge says of working as a staffer in Congress. Loge, who spent years on the Hill in senior positions with former Democratic Sens. Edward Kennedy (Mass.) and Sam Coppersmith (Ariz.), Rep. Brad ShermanBradley (Brad) James ShermanHillicon Valley: Trump seeks review of Pentagon cloud-computing contract | FTC weighs updating kids' internet privacy rules | Schumer calls for FaceApp probe | Report says states need more money to secure elections Here are the 95 Democrats who voted to support impeachment Maxine Waters says her committee will call in Zuckerberg to testify about Libra MORE (D-Calif.) and former Rep. Steve Kagen (D-Wis.) is releasing a book about his favorite sport. “Soccer Thinking for Management Success,” is out in July, timed to be released as the 2018 World Cup, which begins this week, wraps up in Russia. Several of the lessons in his new book, for which Loge interviewed dozens of current and former soccer players, grew out of his experiences on Capitol Hill and in politics. One tip? Scoring a goal at the Capitol can actually be easier with some relaxation. “If you watch a soccer game, you’ll see a lot of players stand still for a lot of the time, they walk, they move slowly,” says Loge, who’s now an associate professor at George Washington University’s School of Media and Public Affairs. “When they have to, they sprint. Because they know that if they don’t take a break, if they don’t relax when they have the opportunity, they won’t be able to sprint when they need to.” “You never move just to seem to be moving, which is what we do in politics all the time,” says Loge, who also served as an Obama-appointed senior adviser to former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Robert Califf. “Staff feel the need to appear to be busy,” Loge adds. “You’re losing your effectiveness because you’re focusing on every shiny object at the moment.” Another frustration born out of Loge’s time in Congress was offices not banding together. “Nobody was working as a team, everybody was working on ‘their thing,’ ” laments Loge. In the “good offices,” Loge says, staffers would be in constant communication and would work hand-in-hand on a “shared mission.” “Soccer Thinking for Management Success,” currently available for preorder, is poised to be released on July 27.

1844517,UK Brexit compromise talks break down | TheHill,"Talks between the United Kingdom's Conservative and Labour parties have ended with no deal for the country to amicably leave the European Union after weeks of negotiations, party leaders announced Friday. The Associated Press reported that Prime Minister Theresa MayTheresa Mary MayTrump, Boris Johnson discuss Brexit, trade issues in Monday phone call Pence to travel to United Kingdom, Ireland and Iceland in September Pelosi vows no UK free trade deal if Brexit undermines Good Friday accord MORE blamed Labour's internal divisions over the issue as a key reason for the talks' failure, pointing to members of the party who would prefer the party seek a second referendum on whether to leave the EU over a deal to successfully do so. “In particular, we have not been able to overcome the fact that there isn’t a common position in Labour about whether they want to deliver Brexit or hold a second referendum, which could reverse it,” she said. But Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn pointed to May's own coalition, which has been battered by the resignation of top advisers in recent months and reports indicating that May herself might step down within weeks, as the culprit behind the inability of the government and the opposition to reach an agreement. The talks with May, Corbyn said, have “gone as far as they can.” “We have been unable to bridge important policy gaps between us,” he wrote in a letter to May that the party later released, according to the AP. In a statement Friday, May said that lawmakers in the U.K. now faced a choice: Deliver her plan for Brexit or deliver uncertainty and economic hardship for British citizens. Lawmakers “will be faced with a stark choice: that is to vote to ... deliver Brexit, or to shy away again from delivering Brexit with all the uncertainty that that would leave,” she said, according to the AP. The British Parliament voted earlier this year to extend the country's deadline for leaving the EU without a deal to October after it looked unlikely for a deal to be reached by the original March 5 deadline.

1846280,Chicago police fire four over alleged cover-up of Laquan McDonald shooting: reports | TheHill,"The Chicago Police Board on Thursday evening fired three officers and a sergeant for their roles in the alleged cover-up of the police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, according to reports. Ex-Chicago officer Jason Van Dyke was sentenced in January to six years and nine months for McDonald’s murder in 2014, and the nine-member board reportedly found that officers Ricardo Viramontes and Janet Mondragon and Sgt. Stephen Franko had all made false statements exaggerating the threat McDonald posed. Officer Daphne Sebastian was accused of bringing discredit to the department, though she was not accused of making false statements, The Chicago Tribune reported. Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) fired the city's police superintendent in late 2015 amid widespread outcry over the handling of the McDonald case following the release of dashboard video of the incident. Cook County's top prosecutor was also voted out of office months later amid controversy over their defense of police actions in the case. McDonald was high on PCP when he refused officers’ demands to drop a knife. He was shot 16 times after trying to walk away. View the discussion thread.

1847785,Dershowitz: Why did Mueller team distort Trump attorney voicemail? | TheHill,"The controversy over the selective editing of a voicemail from a former attorney of President TrumpDonald John TrumpFacebook releases audit on conservative bias claims Harry Reid: 'Decriminalizing border crossings is not something that should be at the top of the list' Recessions happen when presidents overlook key problems MORE in the report by Robert MuellerRobert (Bob) Swan MuellerMueller report fades from political conversation Trump calls for probe of Obama book deal Democrats express private disappointment with Mueller testimony MORE has added fuel to the arguments against the appointment of special counsels. The report says attorney John Dowd reached out to Robert Kelner, a lawyer for Michael Flynn, after Flynn withdrew from a joint defense agreement with the Trump legal team and asked Kelner to give him a heads up. The report characterized the voicemail as an attempt by an attorney of the president to obstruct the cooperation of Flynn with the Mueller investigation, and that is also how much of the press covered it. According to the Mueller report, on November 22, 2017, after Flynn had already withdrawn from the joint defense agreement he had with the president, Dowd left a voicemail for Kelner that said, “I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms … it wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve gone on to make a deal with … the government … if there’s information that implicates the president, then we’ve got a national security issue … we need some kind of heads up … just for the sake of protecting all our interests if we can … remember what we’ve always said about the president and his feelings toward Flynn … that still remains.” The very next day, “Flynn’s attorneys returned the call from the president’s personal counsel to acknowledge receipt of the voicemail” and they restated that “they were no longer in a position to share information under any sort of privilege. According to Flynn’s attorneys, the president’s personal counsel was indignant and vocal in his disagreement. The president’s personal counsel said that he interpreted what they said to him as a reflection of Flynn’s hostility towards the president and that he planned to inform his client of that interpretation,” the report outlines. Only after Judge Emmet Sullivan ordered the government to release a full transcript of the voicemail did it become clear that the Mueller report mischaracterized it. The full message said, “Hey, Rob, this is John again. Maybe I’m sympathetic. I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t … state it in … starker terms. If you have … and it wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve gone on to make a deal with, and work with the government, I understand that you can’t join the joint defense, so that’s one thing.” It continued, “If, on the other hand, we have, there’s information that … implicates the president, then we’ve got a national security issue … I don’t know … some issue we’ve got to deal with, not only for the president, but for the country … then you know, we need some kind of heads up … just for the sake of … protecting all our interests, if we can, without you having to give up any … confidential information … and if it’s the former, then, you know, remember what we’ve always said about the president and his feelings toward Flynn … that still remains, but well, in any event, let me know, and I appreciate your listening and taking the time. Thanks, pal.” The edited version released by the special counsel omits the following important words: “I’m sympathetic … I understand that you can’t join the joint defense, so that’s one thing. If, on the other hand … we’ve got a national security issue … some issue we’ve got to deal with, not only for the president, but for the country … without you having to give up any … confidential information.” The Justice Department claims that the full transcript of the voicemail is consistent with the overall incident. Dowd disagrees, pointing out that by “taking out half my words, they changed the tenor and the contents” of his conversation with Kelner. He notes the irony of Mueller “who kept indicting and prosecuting people for process crimes” but then later “committed a false statement in his own report.” Dowd accused Mueller of seeking to “smear and damage the reputation of counsel and innocent people.” He said the special counsel “never raised or questioned” him about any of these allegations “despite numerous opportunities.” Dowd, a highly respected and veteran Washington lawyer, is rightly upset. The full transcript shows that he is not trying to obstruct the investigation. Instead, he is respectful of the decision by resigned national security adviser Flynn to withdraw from the former joint defense agreement and does not expect his lawyer to disclose any confidential information. Further, he is not only worried about what cooperation by Flynn means for his own client, the president, but also for the country. The request by Dowd was not only entirely proper for an attorney of the president but certainly obligatory for any defense attorney seeking critical information necessary to build his defense. By editing the transcript to fit their narrative, the special counsel team distorted the facts. If a lawyer were to provide a quotation in a court submission that omitted key words that undercut his argument, he would be subject to discipline. The public must be told who approved the decision to remove important words from the Dowd quotation and for what reason. Did Mueller approve the cuts? Did the person who made the cuts inform his superiors precisely what he was omitting and why? Even more than ordinary prosecutors, Mueller and his team have a particular obligation not to engage in this kind of selective editing. Their report is, by its nature, one sided. The public needs to trust what the special counsel lays out in his report. That is why I argued that the report should have been given to attorneys of President Trump before its release, so they would have a chance to vet it and respond to inaccurate characterizations. The public could then decide which narrative was more credible. I hope this is the last time a special counsel is appointed and a one sided report is issued. It would have been much better to have created an independent commission to look into Russian efforts to influence our 2016 election. Now the latest revelation of the Mueller team exposes once again the structural flaws of the office of the special counsel and why it is time to finally abolish it. Alan M.

1849754,Top Dem challenges EPA for skipping hearing on mercury pollution | TheHill,"The chair of a House panel is crying foul over the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) failure to provide an expert to testify on the effects of toxic mercury air pollution.

The agency announced last December it will reconsider the reasoning behind mercury pollution standards for power plants. An EPA spokesperson, however, pushed back on DeGette’s characterization, saying it was “misleading.” “We offered a witness for a different date as we were unable to have someone available tomorrow due to scheduling conflicts. This is customary. We also offered up a briefing to staff,” the spokesperson said. DeGette’s office did not respond to a request for comment on EPA’s supposed scheduling conflict. Other witnesses slated to testify before the committee include Janet McCabe, former acting assistant administrator of the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation. This is not the first time House Democrats and agencies have butted heads when it comes to congressional oversight hearings. Since Democrats took back control of the lower chamber this year, they have increased the number of oversight hearings related to pollution rollbacks and their effects on climate change, often leading to heated arguments. Earlier this month, Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, got in a back and forth with new Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, whom the committee alleged would not set a time to testify in front of the House. Bernhardt’s office said the secretary first wanted to have one-on-one briefings with lawmakers on the committee. His office later agreed to a compromise and testified last week after first sitting down with Grijalva. At the hearing, Grijalva made a pointed comment about the battle over timing. “The committee needs to know what kind of relationship we're going to have with you as an equal branch of government from now on,” Grijalva asked Bernhardt. “Can we expect to have a healthy relationship with the Interior Department?” View the discussion thread.

1852113,"Allbirds, known for its wool sneakers, is getting into the apparel business","Allbirds, the San Francisco-based brand that's amassed a cult-like following of people who wear its comfy wool sneakers, is expanding beyond shoes — starting with socks. The shoemaker said Tuesday that it will begin selling three styles of socks, retailing between $12 and $16, online and at its five bricks-and-mortar shops in the U.S. Like its existing lineup of shoes, the socks will be made from sustainable materials — including plants and recycled plastic bottles. And they're 100% carbon neutral, meaning there's no net release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere during production. The company, recently valued at $1.4 billion, has always intended to grow outside of shoes, according to co-founder Tim Brown. ""Allbirds has never been just about wool or just about footwear."" ""Socks are a start,"" Brown said in an interview. ""Apparel is a whole new business, a whole new supply chain. ... Socks in many ways are obvious [for Allbirds]. ... We are starting as a team to really grow."" Allbirds' move into a new category comes as other so-called Silicon Valley unicorns, which are private start-ups valued at north of $1 billion, expand beyond the products that made them famous. Mattress maker Casper, valued at $1.1 billion, now sells night lights, bedside tables and dog beds. Luggage maker Away, valued at $1.4 billion, sells carry bags, and according to a recent job posting, was looking to hire a ""head of apparel."" ""The brands that are the strongest — the ones with the best flywheel for sales — tend to grow outside of their categories,"" Web Smith, founder of retail subscription platform 2PM, said. Before branching out, however, brands should make sure they have ""absolute command over the category you started in,"" he said. Another reason to move into new categories is to be able to reach shoppers who might not be able to afford the brand's core product, according to Web. Not every person will buy a $1,200 mattress from Casper, he said, but maybe shoppers will go for one of the brand's pillows or bedside lamps. Most important for Allbirds continues to be its focus on utilizing quality materials, like the merino wool it sources from New Zealand, tree fibers from South African farms and sugar cane from southern Brazil, according to Brown. The new socks are made from a proprietary yarn called Trino, which Allbirds made by blending its existing tree and merino materials. ""We didn't invent wool. We didn't invent shoes,"" he said. ""But we're bringing this idea of material invitation,"" to the masses. ""As a company, we can show that you can build a sustainably minded business. ... There's a growing conversation around the environment and the need for businesses to find a better way to make stuff,"" Brown said. Consumers are increasingly thinking about how the things they're buying are made. Forty percent of consumers said sustainable materials were either ""very"" or ""somewhat"" important when thinking about buying shoes, according to a February survey from The NPD Group. A little more than 25% of people said they would pay a small premium to have sustainable footwear, too. Other brands jumping at this opportunity include Rothy's and Greats, which both make shoes out of recycled plastics. ""Brands need to educate customers on their efforts ... to make a lasting connection,"" NPD Group accessories and footwear analyst Beth Goldstein said. Having officially launched in March 2016, Allbirds sold its millionth shoe in just two years in business. The team has raised $77.5 million to date, according to data from Crunchbase, with actor Leonardo DiCaprio participating in Allbirds' latest fundraising, a Series C round, in October.",4.5

""It is preposterous to argue that as we expand Medicare For All that people with cancer and other illnesses will not get the care that they need. In fact, under Medicare For All, the good news is that we will end the horror of millions of people going into bankruptcy and financial distress simply because they need hospital care for serious conditions,"" he added. Biden has called for building upon the Obama-era Affordable Care Act and making a public option such as Medicare available to those who want it. “He said you're going to have to raise taxes on the middle class. He said it's going to end all private insurance,” Biden told reporters Friday of Sanders’s health care plan.  “I don’t want to start over. How many of you out there have had someone you've lost to cancer? Or cancer yourself? No time, man. We cannot have a hiatus of six months, a year, two, three to get something done,” he added. The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill regarding Sanders’s statement. Health care has emerged as a key issue dividing the progressive and centrist candidates on the campaign trail. Several 2020 White House contenders have expressed support for Medicare for All, including Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as well as former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro.   Candidates have been more reserved about whether they support eliminating private insurance, with Warren and New York City Mayor Bill de BlasioBill de BlasioDe Blasio brushes off low poll numbers: 'The vast majority of Democratic voters are going to make their decision late' NYPD fires officer in Eric Garner case Senate Democrats push Trump to permanently shutter migrant detention facility MORE (D) saying they would favor such a move and Harris initially expressing support but later backtracking.

Despite Trump’s insistence that politics should stop at the water’s edge, his criticism of Pelosi largely mirrored comments he made in a Fox News interview on Thursday at the Normandy American Cemetery in France before a D-Day commemoration.

1868402,"Super PACs were biggest spenders in 2018 midterms, report finds","Super PACs aligned with the two major political parties spent more in the 2018 midterms than the parties’ congressional committees did, the first time that’s happened in a midterm election cycle and a milestone that shows the power amassed by the big-money outside groups, a new report released Thursday found. During other midterm elections, party committees like the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee have been the biggest spenders. But in 2018, preliminary totals indicate the three biggest spenders in the election were all super PACs, the Campaign Legal Center’s review found. Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC that worked to elect House Republicans, spent at least $137 million, the report found. The Senate Democrat-aligned Senate Majority PAC spent $112.8 million, and Senate Leadership Fund, the Senate GOP PAC, spent $95 million. The fourth- and fifth-largest spenders were the DCCC and the NRCC, which spent $84 and $74 million respectively. House Majority PAC, which is aligned with House Democrats, spent $72 million. “At the same time that more money was becoming concentrated in a handful of politically connected super PACs, those same super PACs were finding new ways to disguise their spending,” the report said.  Chief among those tactics, it said, were an increased tendency among super PACs to delay naming their donors and a habit among some groups of obscuring their identities while placing political ads on the internet, which is possible due to gaps in disclosure rules. Politico and ProPublica in October identified more than 60 super PACs that had spent money in primaries or general elections but delayed disclosing their donors until after voters went to the polls. That practice sharply increased in 2018: During the 2016 elections, super PACs spent $9 million during congressional primary elections that they delayed disclosing until after voting finished. In 2018, that total increased to more than $15 million. The trend continued during the final days of the election, the Campaign Legal Center found. The group identified 17 super PACs that spent more than $29 million that had not yet reported any contributors or had spent dramatically more than they’d reported raising.",4.0

1872592,Graham: Trump says GOP senators opposing him are ‘playing with fire’,"President Donald Trump said Senate Republicans considering opposition to his emergency declaration on the border are ""playing with fire,"" according to Sen. Lindsey Graham, who met with the president on Tuesday morning. The South Carolina Republican said his meeting with the president focused mostly on the border and the number of illegal crossings as Trump faces certain bipartisan defeat on his emergency declaration in the Senate later this month.  Four Republican senators have said they will join 47 Senate Democrats in voting to block the national emergency declaration, though Trump will veto it and Congress likely won't be able to muster the votes to override it. And though Trump is not waging a massive campaign to convert Republicans to his side, he's acutely aware of the politics of the issue. ""He says he thinks Republicans are playing with fire here because most Republicans, anyway, most people I hope, will see that the border is in a state of crisis,"" Graham said, adding that Trump believes GOP senators that defy him are likely to face a political backlash. ""That's his observation, but he's not out there calling people out or anything."" Graham said Trump also groused about the wide-ranging investigations launched by the Democratic House, and questioned why Democrats are eager to probe his administration and 2016 campaign but not cooperate on legislation. ""He believes they are taking a wrecking ball to his life. Clinton said that about us. They're going nuts,"" Graham said. ""'It seems like nobody wants to solve any problems.' He said that a couple times. He said he's surprised. He thought it would be in everybody's interest [to do] infrastructure and stuff like that.""",4.5
1873585,"Supreme Court leaves Conn., N.Y. assault weapons bans in place","The Supreme Court will let stand bans on assault weapons in Connecticut and New York, laws passed in the wake of a 2012 mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. The court’s decision Monday to reject separate challenges to each state’s law leaves in place measures that ban weapons like the one used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that left 20 children and six faculty members dead. Those laws also prohibit the sale of the type of gun used by terrorist Omar Mateen to kill 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The June 12 terrorist attack at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub has prompted renewed calls for gun control legislation, but the debate has centered mostly on banning individuals on a terrorist no-fly list from purchasing weapons. The discussion has largely avoided calls for a fresh ban on assault weapons, which were banned for a decade and only became legal again in 2004.  Connecticut and New York are two of seven states that ban assault weapons, along with the District of Columbia. The high court’s decisions not to hear the two cases, Shew v. Malloy for Connecticut and Kampfer v. Cuomo for New York, are the latest in a string of such rejections. The Supreme Court has not heard a case pertaining to second-amendment rights since 2010, when it overturned a Chicago law banning handguns. ",3.5
1875513,Trump gets his campaign trail mojo back,"Donald Trump warmed up for his first campaign rally as president, delivering on Friday what amounted to an abbreviated stump speech a day before he will formally return to the trail for a swing state rally this weekend. Trump’s address at a Boeing facility in North Charleston, South Carolina, had nearly all the makings of the mega rallies he hosted throughout his rise from a once-long-shot Republican presidential candidate: a friendly crowd — which he insisted was record size — that at one point chanted “U-S-A.”  The differences between Friday’s photo-op and a campaign rally were subtle, the most notable distinctions being that Trump refrained from attacking the media and spoke with a new Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner behind him instead of his own personal aircraft. Trump himself even noted one variance from what had the unmistakable aura of a campaign rally. “In the old days, when I made this speech, I got paid a whole lot of money. Now I have to do it for nothing,” Trump said, prompting laughter. “Not a good deal, but that’s OK. We love it.” Speaking in a state where he claimed victory in the primary and general election, Trump reflected on South Carolina as a state that was supposed to be “tough to win” but, as he phrased it, “we won in a landslide.” He thanked officials who have supported him from the state, including current Gov. Henry McMaster and former Gov. Nikki Haley, the president’s ambassador to the United Nations. His remarks — he spoke for about 15 minutes — were a condensed version of things he said during the campaign, sprinkled with rhetoric paying homage to his locale.  Trump heaped praise on the aircraft behind him, congratulating the men and women who built it. The plane, he said is “beautiful.” It’s “an amazing piece of art,” he added, and “an amazing piece of work,” even if it is 30 years old.  “Can you believe it? What can look so beautiful at 30?” Trump asked — and answered. “An airplane.” He also detailed the specs of the aircraft: The 330-seat plane is made of carbon fiber and is 18 feet longer than the prior version. “And this airplane can fly for half a day before it touches the ground. The name says it all: Dreamliner,” Trump said. “Great name. Our country is all about making dreams come true.”  “Over the last number of years that hasn’t been necessarily the case, but we’re gonna make it the case again,” he continued. “That’s what we do in America. We dream of things and then we build them. We turn vision into reality, and we will be doing a lot more of that — believe me — in the months and years to come.” It marked a warm-up act, of sorts, as the president will next get a jumpstart on his 2020 campaign with a Saturday afternoon rally in Melbourne, Florida, just one month after being inaugurated as America’s 45th commander in chief. It’s been a tumultuous month for Trump, whose administration has been dogged by leaks, protests, unfavorable court decisions, Cabinet delays, potential investigations over ethics violations and ties to Russia, conflicting narratives coming from his top aides, the withdrawal of his original labor secretary nominee, the ouster of his national security adviser and the rebuffing from the official whom Trump asked to replace him. But Friday represented an opportunity to begin to reset the narrative. Trump will get a break from Washington and spend the next few days at his weekend White House, his Mar-A-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Largely sticking to the script on Friday, Trump spoke of rebuilding the military to create “peace through strength” and of his America-first strategy that he says will slash regulations, lower taxes, bring back jobs, punish companies that leave the country but try to sell their products here, and put an end to “tremendous cheating” in foreign trade. “Already, American industry is roaring back, and believe me, if we, not me — I’m a messenger — if we didn’t have this victory, we wouldn’t be even talking about it,” Trump said. “Since November, jobs have already begun to surge.” For as much as Friday’s event seemed like a rally, though, it also had hints of pandering. Trump at one point used the plane and the plant as a symbol for what America can achieve. “Working together as a unit, there is nothing we cannot accomplish: no task too large, no dream too great, no goal beyond our reach,” Trump said. “Just like you built this incredible airplane behind me — both of them, when you think about it — we are going to rebuild this country.” And if it wasn’t clear that he was playing to the crowd there, it was unmistakable in closing. “God bless you,” Trump said. “May God bless the United States of America. And God bless Boeing.”",2.5
1876540,Parties reserve $65 million for Senate battle,"On Tuesday, it became clear just how expensive the battle for the Senate will be: Democrats and Republicans combined to reserve about $65 million of television airtime for this fall — and that’s just the beginning of it. Party strategists said the $37 million locked up by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the $28 million from the National Republican Senatorial Committee represent just the tip of the iceberg. Indeed, each party picked five presidential battleground states for its initial round of reservations, leaving off states that are sure to be contested in the November battle for the Senate but perhaps not at the presidential level. Both Republicans and Democrats are moving in April to reserve ads that won’t air for months for fear the presidential campaign will drive up prices as the general election draws near. Republicans currently hold 54 seats, and if Democrats retain the presidency they need to net just four seats to take back the majority. But GOP aides and officials say that their party and outside groups may become increasingly committed to holding the Senate if their presidential prospects sink with the nomination of Donald Trump. The NRSC will place the bulk of its money in efforts to aid its at-risk incumbents. Republicans reserved $6.8 million to defend Sen. Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire; $6.7 million to help Sen. Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania; $5.9 million to assist Sen. Rob Portman in Ohio; and about $2 million in Wisconsin, where Sen. Ron Johnson faces a steep path to reelection. Republicans have also reserved $6.3 million in Nevada, where the GOP is angling to take the seat being vacated by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. “We know that Democrats have their sights set on our majority, and we are taking nothing for granted,” said NRSC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek. “While the DSCC announced today that they are hanging many of their candidates out to dry in supposedly targeted races, we are spending smartly and playing offense.” The DSCC is committing $10 million each in Florida and Ohio, two pricey and massive states with multiple media markets that are key to Democrats’ hopes of netting the seats needed to win back the majority. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is leaving the Senate this fall, which has touched off a scramble in both parties to succeed him. While national Democrats favor Rep. Patrick Murphy over liberal bomb-thrower Rep. Alan Grayson in the Florida primary, Democrats’ $10 million in spending announced Tuesday is committed to the general election and not the primary. Democrats are also spending $8 million in New Hampshire, where there’s an increasingly brutal battle between Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan and Ayotte. Outside groups have spent millions there on each candidate, with Planned Parenthood becoming the latest entrant on Tuesday with a $400,000 ad buy aimed at Ayotte. The DSCC also plans to spend $5 million in Colorado to defend its lone vulnerable incumbent, Sen. Michael Bennet, and $4 million in Nevada, where it hopes to hold Reid’s seat against a challenge from Rep. Joe Heck, the favored Republican. “The DSCC is in a strong position to retake the majority this year and support our candidates in the fall, and it’s laughable that the NRSC is claiming to be on offense when their ad reservations show what a difficult job they’ve got defending vulnerable incumbents across the country,” said Sadie Weiner, a spokeswoman for the DSCC. Both parties are leaving the bright blue state of Illinois off their initial plans. While the race between GOP Sen. Mark Kirk and Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth is sure to see eye-popping spending numbers, party officials believe they can place ad buys later because the state is not expected to be closely contested at the presidential level. Meanwhile, Democrats have recruited a number of candidates in redder states like North Carolina, Missouri and Arizona but have not yet tipped their hand on who will get air support from the national party as Democrats try to expand the map beyond the seven battlegrounds of Illinois, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Hampshire, Nevada and Florida. Republicans will spend the next six months almost entirely on defense, defending 24 seats and hoping to give Bennet a spirited challenge in Colorado.",2.5
1876635,Clinton: 'I never worried about' the FBI's email investigation,"Hillary Clinton was “never worried about” the FBI’s investigation into the private email server she used as secretary of state. After a year-long probe into her email practices at the State Department, FBI Director James Comey said that the former secretary of state and her aides were “extremely careless” with their handling of classified information but concluded that their actions fell short of criminal wrongdoing, a finding he reaffirmed this past Sunday.  “Oh, to be honest with you, I never worried about it,” Clinton said in an interview with “The Morning Walking Crew” that was broadcast Tuesday. “I really didn't understand what they were doing, but I was absolutely confident that it would come out as they said it did [Sunday].”  “And I think most people have processed all of that,” she continued. “We’ve got to move on. We’ve got to worry about what we're going to do to help everybody in America.""",4.5
1883779,Democratic women sweep into office in state elections,"Female candidates swept into office in Virginia and other state and local elections around the country Tuesday, giving Democrats the first taste of a force reshaping their party in the first year of President Donald Trump’s administration. Women running for office for the first time might have wrested control of the Virginia House of Delegates from Republicans, who held the chamber since the 20th century. Another female Democrat flipped the Washington state Senate to her party’s control, alongside Democratic women who picked up state legislative seats in Georgia and Michigan, while Manchester, New Hampshire, elected its first Democratic mayor in decades in Joyce Craig — who is also the city’s first female mayor. The Virginia races especially, some of which are currently in the recount process, outperformed Democrats’ wildest expectations before the 2017 elections. And as the party looks ahead to 2018, that success has prompted progressives, pro-abortion groups and Democratic candidate recruiters to double down on encouraging female candidates and running on issues like women’s health and equal pay in the midterm elections and beyond. “Gender played a huge role in the campaigns this year,” said Joshua Ulibarri, who served as Virginia House Democrats’ pollster in 2017. “The excitement among women can’t be measured other than last night with those 16 seats,” Ulibarri added, referring to the 16 or more House of Delegates seats Democrats appeared likely to pick up as of Wednesday. Trump’s election a year ago nudged several of the successful female candidates into politics. So did January’s Women’s March, where they got a taste of politics while organizing female activists in their areas. Hala Ayala, a first-time candidate for office who won her race in suburban Prince William County, helped organize buses to Washington, D.C., so that women could attend. Several days after the march, after Ayala learned that her delegate supported having a “day of tears” mourning abortion, she decided to make a run. “I said ‘I’m running for office, I can’t see those Trump policies in my backyard,'” Ayala said. She soon found herself in a cohort of first-time female candidates in the Northern Virginia suburbs. They bonded over the course of the year, checking in often about balancing the pressures of candidacy with work and child care, and texting one another, “How are you holding up?” after attacks from opponents. Tuesday’s elections will at least double the share of women represented in Virginia’s House of Delegates. They also represented close to half of the candidates this year, and two-thirds of the candidates running in the crucial 17 House of Delegates districts that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. “The energy among Democratic women to step up and run for office is a moment we have been waiting for at EMILY’s List for 32 years,” said Stephanie Schriock, president of the political-action committee that backs female Democratic candidates. The group backed 16 women running for the Virginia House of Delegates, at least 13 of whom won. (One race is still too close to call.) Ahead of the 2018 midterms, EMILY’s List has roughly doubled the number of U.S. House districts where it is recruiting candidates, Schriock said. The group is attempting to recruit candidates in more than 80 districts and has backed 47 female candidates. Then there are districts like Virginia’s 10th, where multiple Democratic women are running to take on GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock and EMILY’s List is not picking sides. Republicans have meanwhile recruited several female candidates who they hope will show promise in 2018, such as Kimberlin Brown Pelzer, a former soap opera actress who spoke at last year’s Republican National Convention. In Virginia, Republican lieutenant governor candidate Jill Vogel accrued more votes than any other woman running for a statewide office in the state’s history, according to the state Republican Party. The success of Democrats in Virginia underscored the importance of Republicans’ do-or-die push this fall to overhaul the tax code, one national Republican argued on Wednesday. Tax reform “is something that is really applicable and relatable to a lot of female voters out there. There are a lot of women who feel financially stressed at home, they’re often the ones who are balancing the checkbooks,” said one GOP operative focused on House races. “That’s important when it comes to finding issues that will resonate in 2018.” Some Democrats looking to Virginia as a test case for the 2018 elections meanwhile made the case that the elections show the party can successfully focus on women’s health and abortion, which remains a divisive stance. Northam, who blew out Gillespie in an unexpected 9-point victory, routinely talked about protecting women’s right to chose on the campaign trail. Statewide exit polling found that a bigger share of women supported Democrat Ralph Northam than had backed Clinton in the 2016 elections. White, college-educated women voted to elect Northam by 58 to 42 percentage points, a jump from the 50 percent of white college-educated women who supported Clinton and 44 percent who supported Trump last year, according to exit polls released by The Washington Post. Planned Parenthood officials discussed previously unreleased polling on Wednesday, conducted in late October, that found messaging about women’s health made voters who lean Democratic 4 percentage points more likely to support Northam for governor. Northam won among women by 22 percentage points, a higher share than Clinton, according to exit polls. “The No. 1 thing that is activating any person in the U.S. right now is this feeling that women are under attack,” said Deirdre Schifeling, executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes. National Democrats also pointed to Tuesday’s wins in Virginia as a reinforcement for their party’s strategy for taking back the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018 by targeting suburban areas where minority populations have grown in recent years and educated, white women are seen as a key demographic for Democrats looking to grow support. For example, in Loudoun County, which consists of both suburban and exurban areas, Northam beat Gillespie 59 percent to 39 percent.  “Women voters are going to drive the future of those districts, and they’re voting Democrat,” Schriock said.",3.5
1885408,Pence retains outside counsel as Russia probes deepen,"Vice President Mike Pence has retained his own attorney as two congressional committees and special counsel Robert Mueller investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible ties between members of Donald Trump’s campaign team and Moscow. Pence has retained as outside counsel Richard Cullen, a partner at McGuireWoods, the vice president's office confirmed on Thursday. ""I can confirm that the Vice President has retained Richard Cullen of McGuireWoods to assist him in responding to inquiries by the special counsel. The Vice President is focused entirely on his duties and promoting the President's agenda and looks forward to a swift conclusion of this matter,” Jarrod Agen, Pence’s communications director, said in a statement to POLITICO. Pence considered several candidates to provide legal counsel and selected Cullen earlier this week. The Washington Post was the first to report the news. Cullen served as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia under President George H.W. Bush and later as Virginia’s attorney general. He also served as former Sen. Paul Trible’s special counsel during the Iran-Contra affair and worked on the staff of former Rep. M. Caldwell Butler during the Watergate investigation. Rounding out his legal bona fides, Cullen worked on George W. Bush’s legal team during the contested 2000 presidential election. Cullen has represented high-profile clients before, including former Rep. Tom DeLay, former FIFA president Sepp Blatter and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Jeffrey Lacker. Pence has come under increasing scrutiny in recent months. He chaired Trump’s transition, which included hiring Michael Flynn as national security adviser. Flynn was later fired for allegedly misleading Pence about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador. Pence also defended Trump’s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, pointing to recommendations from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. But Trump later said that he would have fired Comey regardless of those recommendations and that he had the Russia investigation in mind when he made the decision. That firing has prompted Mueller to reportedly look into whether Trump obstructed justice by firing the FBI director and by earlier attempting to get Comey to drop the investigation of Flynn. Trump denies the latter, even though Comey described the conversation in congressional testimony. Comey testified that the vice president was among the officials in the Oval Office whom Trump asked to leave before he allegedly requested that the then-FBI director “let this go,” referring to the federal probe into Flynn. Pence is among many senior White House aides likely to be questioned by Mueller’s investigators as they look into potential obstruction of justice.  “Anybody in the presence of the president when the room was cleared” should expect a call from Mueller seeking an interview, said Lanny Davis, a former senior Clinton White House legal adviser. Darren Samuelsohn contributed to this report.",4.0
1888606,Trump calls for ‘complete American energy independence’,"Donald Trump outlined an ""America first"" energy agenda Thursday that includes eliminating a slew of environmental regulations, expanding fossil fuel development, killing the Paris climate deal and ending U.S. reliance on OPEC — with the aim of creating what he called “complete American energy independence.”   “This plan will make America wealthy again,” Trump told an audience in North Dakota, an epicenter of the U.S. oil boom, which has been suffering in the past two years from a global plunge in petroleum prices. He said: “It’s a choice between sharing in this great energy wealth or sharing in the poverty promised by Hillary Clinton.” Trump outlined a test for any regulation under his administration: ""Is this regulation good for the American worker? If it doesn’t pass this test, this rule will not be under any circumstances approved."" He continued, ""In a Trump administration, political activists with extreme agendas will no longer write the rules, because that’s what’s happening now.” The presumptive GOP presidential nominee said he'll repeal President Barack Obama's climate regulations for power plants, as well as the Waters of the U.S. Rule, an EPA regulation that has drawn fierce resistance from the energy and agriculture industries. And he declared that he would ""cancel"" the Paris climate deal, while blocking climate-related funding to the United Nations.  On OPEC, Trump said, ""We will become and stay totally independent of any need to import energy from the OPEC cartel,"" adding, ""We don’t deal with them. We’ll handle them just fine.” He said renewable energy has a place in his agenda, ""but not to the exclusion of other forms of energy."" His administration will focus on ""real environmental problems,"" like clean water.  Trump also promised to lift moratoriums on energy development on public lands and ""remove obstacles"" to oil and gas development. He added that he'd use ""revenues from energy production"" to fund infrastructure improvements.  It would be difficult for a Trump administration to quickly overturn environmental regulations that have already been finalized, and challenging OPEC could result in retaliatory price increases.

1890850,"Flyers will pay more for carbon offsets but not tax, study finds","LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Travelers are willing to pay more for flights if they believe the extra money will be used to tackle carbon emissions, researchers said on Friday. Passengers were more likely to book flights that carried an extra fee if it was labeled as carbon offset than if it was called a carbon tax, researchers at the University of British Columbia found. Offsetting aims to mitigate the climate damage carbon emissions cause by paying to prevent or reduce emissions elsewhere. “Taxes feel like you’re charging people money for nothing,” said David Hardisty, an assistant professor of marketing and behavioral science at UBC Sauder School of Business. “Whereas an offset is the idea that, ‘Sure we’re paying, but we kind of have an idea where that payment is going, to make the environment better,’ which is what people want.” The findings were published this week in the Journal of Environmental Psychology and suggest a possible way for the global airline industry, under pressure over carbon emissions, to improve its record. The study consisted of two separate online surveys of more than 1,800 participants in the United States. The aim was to gauge consumers’ reaction to a $14 carbon fee that was presented to them in several different ways at the time of a hypothetical ticket purchase. Consumers were more likely to pick a flight that included a carbon price when it was called “carbon offset for aviation fuel production and import” as opposed to “carbon tax for airplane travel”. They even chose more expensive tickets with a fee described this way over cheaper tickets that did not have the $14 fee attached, according to the study. As global concern over the environment grows, many people are choosing to shun flying altogether rather than offset their emissions. A survey published this week found that one in five travelers reports flying less. Meanwhile, celebrities who speak out about climate change, from actor Emma Thompson to Britain’s Prince Harry, are facing growing scrutiny over their jetsetting. Air travel already accounts for about 2.5 percent of global emissions and the rapid growth means that by 2050, aviation could take up a quarter of the world’s “carbon budget”, according to the United Nations.

1891616,Highest Indian monsoon rains in 25 years to boost winter crops,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Monsoon rains in India were 10% above average in 2019 and the highest in 25 years as seasonal rainfall continued longer than expected, the weather department said on Monday. Extra June-September monsoon rainfall will help farmers expand areas under winter-sown crops such as wheat, rice rapeseed and chick peas, improving their earning potential and helping revive tepid rural demand that has stung Indian economic growth. The longer monsoon could also restock reservoirs and help replenish ground water, helping assuage water shortages in pockets of the country of 1.3 billion people. But heavy rainfall in some areas has damaged summer-sown crops like cotton, soybean and pulses that are close to harvest. The monsoon delivers about 70% of India’s annual rainfall and determines the yield of rice, wheat, sugarcane and oilseeds, such as soybeans. Farming accounts for about 15% of India’s $2.5 trillion economy but employs more than half of its people. “Even in the first half of October, above average rainfall is expected due to a delay in the withdrawal of the monsoon,” said an official with the India Meteorological Department (IMD), declining to be named as he was not authorized to speak with media. The monsoon generally begins in June and starts to retreat by Sept. 1, but rains have lasted longer this year, triggering fatal floods and killing hundreds of people. Rains are unlikely to start receding before early October, more than a month later than usual, the head of the weather office said on Friday. “Excessive rainfall wasn’t of much benefit to summer crops due to erratic weather patterns, but it will help winter crops. Reservoirs are holding more water than normal,” said Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai. The 2019 monsoon season got off to a bleak start with the driest June in five years and below-average precipitation in July, suggesting an initial prediction for lower than normal rainfall from the country’s only private forecaster, Skymet, could come to pass. The weather department had also said in May that rains this year would amount to 96% of the long-term average. But August saw heavy rains and flooding in some states and the strong monsoon has stretched into this month. Water levels in India’s main reservoirs were at 89% of their storage capacity as on Sept. 27 against 74% a year earlier, government data shows. The average for the past 10 years is 72%.

1898966,Donald Trump creating committees to raise big money for GOP,"Editor’s Note: This story has been updated to reflect the fact that POLITICO did not contact official spokespeople for the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee before publishing this article and that the RNC disputes this reporting. It is our policy to do so and we regret the error.  Donald Trump, facing calls to mend the rift he created in the Republican Party, is putting the final touches on two separate fundraising committees that will allow him to solicit massive checks to help the GOP candidates with whom he’ll share the November ballot, according to three sources familiar with the plans. Trump’s presidential campaign is poised to form a joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee and at least 10 state parties, according to the sources. If such a committee were to accept maximum donations for the general election funds of each of its component committees — $2,700 for the general election to Trump’s campaign, $33,400 to the RNC and $10,000 to each of the state parties — the total would come to $136,100 per person.  Plans call for a second joint committee that would include the Trump campaign and the GOP’s two congressional campaign committees — the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee, said to the sources. If such a committee were to accept maximum donations for the general election funds of each of its component committees — $2,700 for the general election to Trump’s campaign and $33,400 each to the NRSC and the NRCC — the total would come to $69,500 per person. Both committees could accept much accept larger maximum checks if they were to include maximum donations to special party funds created in 2014 for conventions, legal expenses and headquarter-building improvements. The donation limits for each of those funds is $102,000, so, if they were included in the Trump joint fundraising committees, the maximum allowable donation could soar to about $440,000 or more per person for each of the two joint committees, though most of that cash could not be spent directly on campaign-related expenses. The sources, who declined to be identified discussing ongoing negotiations, said they expected the joint fundraising agreements to be finalized this week. The creation of the joint fundraising committees comes as Trump and the Republican Party are taking steps to mend the wounds left by a contentious primary during which the anti-establishment candidate repeatedly called out the GOP’s leaders and donors — sometimes in deeply personal terms. Officials from the Trump campaign, the RNC, the NRSC and the NRCC declined to comment on the joint fundraising committee negotiations. The official spokespeople for the RNC and NRSC were not contacted and the RNC has disputed this reporting. But the creation of the committees will represent a formal about-face from the billionaire candidate’s primary campaign boasts about self-financing his White House bid. His lack of investment in fundraising has left Trump scrambling to lay the groundwork to raise $1 billion for a general election campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton’s well-funded political machine. Clinton created an unprecedented joint fundraising committee with the Democratic National Committee and 32 state party committees that can accept checks as large as $356,100. The Hillary Victory Fund, as the group is known, has helped Clinton raise $213.5 million for her campaign and more than $46 million for the Democratic Party through the end of April. Trump, by contrast, had brought in $49 million through the end of March, $36 million of which had come from loans from his own pocket. The joint fundraising committee with the RNC and the state parties would help the party build get-out-the-vote operations in key states that would benefit Trump and other Republicans on the ballot, who some party leaders feared could be harmed by a Trump-led ticket. The massive joint committees were legalized by a 2014 Supreme Court decision called McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission that struck down aggregate limits on total giving to federal campaigns. That allowed wealthy donors to donate to as many candidates, party committees and PACs as they want, paving the way for joint fundraising committees including many more committees.",4.5
1900224,Wendy Davis leaves door open to Planned Parenthood gig,"Subscribe to Women Rule on Apple Podcasts here. | Subscribe via Stitcher here. AUSTIN, Texas — Could Wendy Davis, the former Texas state senator who rose to national prominence after her marathon 2013 filibuster protesting an anti-abortion bill, be in the running to be the next head of Planned Parenthood?  The prominent Democratic surrogate isn't ruling out the possibility.   The one-time Texas gubernatorial candidate spoke to POLITICO’s Anna Palmer for a live taping of the Women Rule podcast Monday at the South by Southwest festival and sidestepped questions about her interest in joining the organization. Planned Parenthood’s current president, Cecile Richards, announced her plans to step down earlier this year. She is slated to leave the organization in May.  Planned Parenthood has set up a committee and is working with a search firm to find her replacement. Davis is one of several Democratic women who are privately being discussed among Democratic operatives and donors as a potential successor to Richards.  In many ways, Davis could be an attractive candidate. She has a national fundraising operation and is skilled at raising large amounts of money online, is a regular on the Democratic political circuit and is a much sought-after surrogate. She recently backed two candidates in Texas who could be the first Latina congresswomen from the state. Davis said she expects to get more involved in races across the country during the 2018 election.  And, she has a long history of working with Planned Parenthood. Davis rose to national fame in 2013 as a Texas state senator when she orchestrated a marathon filibuster, which helped to temporarily block an abortion bill that, among other things, banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The filibuster delayed the bill's passage, though it eventually did pass.  When asked Monday whether she could see herself running the organization someday, given her active involvement, Davis praised the work of the group. She didn't directly address whether she was interested in Richards' position.   Davis currently runs Deeds Not Words, an organization helping empower women to fight for gender equality and seek policy changes.  “Planned Parenthood and the mission of Planned Parenthood — the health care provided by Planned Parenthood — is always going to be part of the core of who I am,” she said. “I’m so proud that I’ve had an opportunity to travel all over this country and help Planned Parenthood affiliates to be successful.” While her comments were sparse on specifics, Davis added: “I’m going to continue to do everything I can to stand for the work that they do and, obviously, for women’s reproductive freedoms in general.”  She also credited much of her personal and professional success to the group’s services.  “I know — without a doubt — that without Planned Parenthood, without the contraceptive care that I received from them so that I could prevent a second unplanned pregnancy, I know I wouldn’t be here today,” she told Palmer. Davis, who once had an ectopic pregnancy, had previously said that a procedure performed by Planned Parenthood saved her life.",4.5
1904245,Conway to CNN's Cuomo: Trump is not sheltering Russia 'and don’t you say that again',"Kellyanne Conway, the incoming counselor to President-elect Donald Trump, took exception Friday morning to the assertion of CNN anchor Chris Cuomo that her boss is “sheltering Russia” by refusing to concede that the Kremlin was behind election-year cyberattacks against U.S. political targets. “He’s not sheltering Russia, and don’t you say that again. He’s not sheltering Russia,” Conway shot back. “What the heck has the current president done vis-a-vis Russia for the last eight years to make you proud? Name it. Tell me.” That exchange came amid a contentious interview between Cuomo and Conway on CNN’s “New Day” in which the anchor attempted to corner Trump’s former campaign manager on the president-elect’s unwillingness to accept the conclusions of the intelligence community he will take control of later this month. Conway contended that Trump and his team are “against any foreign government hacking or interfering with the United States” but that the intense focus on the cyberattacks is the work of “those out there who are trying to delegitimize his presidency, review the election results and you know it.” Conway said that there is no evidence that Russian interference played any role in Trump’s surprise victory and suggested that there is an agenda on the part of some media, CNN included, to attribute the win to anything other than the president-elect’s successful campaign and his connection with the American people. “I think you want your viewers to believe that the election results, it all came down to 70,000-plus few votes in three states. It came down to so much more than that,” she told Cuomo. “Remember, the moment you mention Russian hacking and the election in the same sentence, you know what the impression is for a lot of the viewers out there. You know what’s afoot here.” When Cuomo suggested that it was “troubling” that Trump might ignore the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia did indeed launch cyberattacks against American political targets, Conway responded, “No, it’s not. Really, you're making conclusions up now.” Trump is scheduled to be briefed on Friday by the heads of multiple intelligence agencies on Russia’s cyberattacks, activity that he has thus far been unwilling to pin on the Kremlin despite the assessment of 17 federal intelligence agencies to the contrary. His briefing will cap a week in which he devoted significant time to casting doubt upon the intelligence community and its conclusions, at times siding with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who said he did not receive any hacked emails from a foreign state, and derisively placing the word “intelligence” in quotation marks in multiple posts to his Twitter account.  Ultimately, Conway said, whether or not Russia was in fact to blame for the cyberattacks will not matter in light of Trump’s Election Day victory. “I don't want to relitigate the election, because we won,” she said as Cuomo tried to talk over her. “No, I don’t want to relitigate the election. We won, and that says a lot. That finishes many sentences.”",3.5
1908563,Trump now says Russia is meddling in elections — for Democrats,"President Donald Trump on Tuesday claimed that he is ""very concerned"" that Russia will be ""pushing very hard"" for Democrats in the upcoming midterms, contradicting his earlier statement he does not believe Russia is still interfering in U.S. politics and renewing his allegation of potentially rigged elections. ""I’m very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election. Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me, they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats. They definitely don’t want Trump!"" the president tweeted. The tweet follows a week of backlash from Republicans and Democrats alike from the president’s summit with Vladimir Putin, in which he appeared to side with the Russian president over his own intelligence officers on whether Moscow interfered in the 2016 election. During that same news conference, Putin explicitly stated that he did want Trump to win, which undercuts Trump's Tuesday tweet. Trump also stated last week that he does not believe that Russia is still targeting U.S. elections — a claim the White House later tried to walk back. The White House is currently taking steps to schedule a second Trump-Putin meeting in Washington D.C. this fall. The Kremlin, however, said Tuesday that Russia hasn't begun preparations for another meeting between Trump and Putin, according to Reuters.  “There are other options which our leaders can look at,” Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said. He suggested possibly coordinating an event during a G20 meeting in Argentina in November, Reuters reported. “Maybe there will be other international events which Trump and Putin will take part in,"" Ushakov said. Trump has called elections rigged in the past, often saying during the 2016 campaign that the presidential election was rigged in favor of his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.  The president's tweet Tuesday also appears to be an attempt to manage expectations around Republicans' performance in the midterms, which usually favor the party that is not in control of the White House.

1918867,Iranian Baby Impacted By Trump's Travel Ban Doing Well After Life-Saving Surgery,"An Iranian baby who had been banned from traveling to the US for life-saving surgery was finally allowed to enter the country and is now ""out of the woods"" after her surgery on Friday. Four-month-old Fatemeh Reshad and her family flew to Portland, Oregon, where their relatives live, on Feb. 17 after receiving a waiver to enter the US. Reshad received surgery the same day. Her physicians say it was more complicated because it's typically performed within days or weeks, rather than months, after birth, but that the family's delay in flying to the US wasn't necessarily enough time to affect her condition, according to the Associated Press. ""Her heart function looks beautiful,"" said Dr. Laurie Armsby, who works at the Oregon Health Sciences University's Doernbecher Children's Hospital. Earlier this month, Reshad and her family had an appointment in Dubai to get a tourist visa to the US, before Trump's executive order caused it to be canceled. The order banning travel to the U.S. by people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iran. Fatemeh was forced to return home. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement on Feb. 3 the infant, who was banned under President Donald Trump's executive order, would be allowed to travel for the emergency procedure to correct serious heart defects. The baby's uncle Samad Taghizadeh, a US citizen, told the Oregonian his relatives were planning to travel from Iran to Dubai, where they would seek a visa to enter the US. But with the travel ban, their appointment at the US Embassy in Dubai was canceled and the trip to seek treatment for baby Fatemah was called off. “My father was so excited to see his granddaughter for the first time,” Taghizadeh said. “Our whole family is in a depression.” But on Friday, Governor Cuomo said Manhattan's Mount Sinai Medical Center had offered to perform the critical surgery, but the family finally chose to do it in Portland, Oregon, both because of the hospital's pediatric cardiology expertise and proximity to the baby's uncle and grandparents. ""Bizarrely, the federal ban would prevent this child from receiving medical care and literally endanger her life. It is repugnant to all we believe as Americans and as members of the human family,"" the governor said in a statement. ""This evening we were pleased to learn that the federal government has now granted Fatemeh Reshad and her family boarding documents to come to the United States. ""We will continue to work with the International Refugee Assistance Project and their partners to ensure this baby receives the treatment she needs, and fight for those being unfairly shut out of America's gates by this policy.""",3.5
1919178,"Six Patriots Players Are Refusing To Meet Trump, Raising The Pressure On Their Teammates","Martellus Bennett after winning Super Bowl 51 on Sunday. Fresh off their win at the Super Bowl, six members of the New England Patriots have backed out of the traditional post-game meeting with President Donald Trump — a sharp new sign of deepening American divisions. Tight end Martellus Bennett was the first player to back out of the meeting at the White House, which is typically held for members of the team that won the Super Bowl. Bennett announced he wouldn't be attending the meeting shortly after the Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday. The next day, safety Devin McCourty joined Bennett, saying he would not attend the meeting because ""I don’t feel accepted in the White House."" ""With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won’t,” he said in an interview with Time. Other team members soon followed: On Wednesday, linebacker Dont’a Hightower said he wouldn't attend. Then, on Thursday, running back LeGarrette Blount, defensive tackle Alan Branch, and defensive end Chris Long all said they would not be attending the meeting with Trump. Devin McCourty, left, and running back LeGarrette Blount hold a Super Bowl trophy Tuesday in Boston. Five of the players planning to skip the meeting are black. The sixth, Long, who is white, announced he wouldn't attend in response to an open letter in the New York Daily News criticizing a ""pathetic sea of NFL white silence this year."" In addition to the Daily News letter, fans have also been stepping up pressure for team members to boycott the White House meeting, and expressing support for those who won't attend. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is a well-known friend of Trump who skipped a post-Super Bowl visit to the White House in 2015 while Obama was president. At the time, Brady cited a ""prior family commitment."" Rob Gronkowski's rep told BuzzFeed News that the tight end ""doesn't have a comment as of right now."" The past year, however, has seen the NFL became increasingly politicized as Trump rose to the presidency on a platform many have described as racist, and as police shootings against black men continued to make headlines. Most notably, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick repeatedly refused to stand during the national anthem last year, prompting other players to do the same.",2.0
1920246,People Want This Politician To Resign After He Said Southern Europeans Spend On Booze And Women,"Earlier this week, Dijsselbloem spoke to the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. ""During the crisis of the euro, the countries of the north have shown solidarity with the countries affected by the crisis,"" he said. ""As a Social Democrat, I attribute exceptional importance to solidarity. [But] you also have obligations. You can not spend all the money on drinks and women and then ask for help."" In a post on Facebook, Matteo Renzi, the former Italian prime minister, called Dijsselbloem's remarks ""stupid"", and said ""if he wants to offend Italy, he should do so in a bar, not while holding public office."" Meanwhile, the leader of the group of social democratic MEPs, Gianni Pittella, said Dijsselbloem wasn't fit for public office, and called his comments discriminatory. On Wednesday, Portugal's socialist prime minister, Antonio Costa, chimed in, demanding Dijsselbloem's resignation. Costa described the Dutch finance minister's remark as ""racist, xenophobic, and sexist."" Renzi, Pittella, and Costa's stance is likely to weigh heavily on Dijsselbloem's fate, as their political parties and the Dutch finance minister's Labour party are all part of the same centre-left alliance in the European parliament. But Dijsselbloem's loose-lipped comments also caused some anxiety among centre-right politicians. The whole incident caps a bad 10 days for Dijsselbloem. In last week's Dutch elections, his Labour party collapsed to nine seats from the 38 it held five years ago. The poor result means that Dijsselbloem and Labour, currently the junior coalition partner in the Netherlands, are unlikely to be in government much longer.",3.5

According to the Economist, bots attempted to purchase 5 billion tickets from Ticketmaster in 2016, which is 10,000 tickets per minute. The official terms and conditions of Taylor Swift Tix say that “a purchase or payment of any kind will not increase your chances.” Further down, it also says, “You may then take one (1) or more of the following OPTIONAL fan engagement actions (“Boosts”) listed on the site and as defined below to improve your position in line to purchase tickets to Taylor Swift’s upcoming concert tour.” Despite the fact that the website says ""no purchase or boost activity is necessary to enter or receive an access code,"" fans are still encouraged to participate in ""boosting"" activities that involve spending money in order ""to improve [their] position in line to purchase tickets."" Therefore, the more money fans spend on merchandise and on copies of Swift's album, the more likely they are to gain access to purchase tickets for a future concert.

1929360,People Indulged In Some Serious Retail Therapy After A Long 2017,"Holiday shoppers ended the year with plenty of retail therapy, brightening up an otherwise bleak year for retail. Sales in November and December last year increased to $691.9 billion, up 5.5% over the same period in 2016, according to the National Retail Federation, a trade group. Shopping at online or other nontraditional stores accounted for about $138.4 billion in sales, according to the trade group. That is an increase of 11.5% in online sales over the year before. “Retail today doesn’t look like retail 10 years ago, and it certainly won’t look the same in another 10 years,” Matthew Shay, the National Retail Federation’s CEO, said in a statement. “But retail is retail, and will always be here to serve its customers.” The holiday sales numbers end a year of tumult within the retail industry as companies wrestled with how to ramp up their digital strategies to reach consumers who, thanks to Amazon, expect fast and seamless buying and delivery experiences. Amazon, which added 4 million Prime members in just one week over the holiday season, dominated online shopping throughout November and December. The company controlled 38% of the online holiday shopping season, according to Slice Intelligence, an e-commerce data analysis company. Best Buy came in second but far behind, with just 4% of online sales. While Amazon increased its holiday season market share by a half of a percent, competitors like Target tried to keep pace. The big-box retailer grew its market share by just over half a percent, according to Slice Intelligence. This suggests its strategy to convert some of its brick-and-mortar retail spaces into online distribution center spaces and smaller stores is working. Digital sales helped grow Target’s sales by 3.4% over November and December compared with the year before, the company reported Tuesday. Its stores fulfilled 70% of Target’s digital orders over the holiday season, meaning that stores enabled about 80% of the company’s comparable sales growth in that period. Holiday spending was up in part because unemployment is low and consumer confidence is high. The unemployment rate was 4.1% in December for the third consecutive month, bringing the total number of unemployed people to 6.6 million, according to the Bureau of Labor. People were also feeling more optimistic about their finances in December than they had in 17 years, according to a December report from the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. About 50% of all consumers reported that their finances had improved, and they said they planned to shop more during the holiday season. And though department stores took a battering in 2017, with a number of stores closing and consumers moving online, they also saw their sales go up this holiday. Macy’s reported that during November and December, its sales increased by 1% compared with last year. JCPenney reported a 3.4% growth in sales, compared with a decrease of 3.1% in the same period last year. While it remains unclear how department stores and shopping centers will fare in the post-holiday shopping year, several retailers’ stocks rose on Friday after news of the improved holiday sales. People in the industry are relishing the bright spot in sales reports. “It was a very positive season,” Stephanie Cegielski, a spokesperson for the International Council of Shopping Centers, a global trade association of the shopping center industry, told BuzzFeed News. “I think that also goes to show consumer confidence is at a good point and people have settled down a bit and they’re spending money — which is what we want them to do.”",3.5

1937501,Australia's Crown Resorts sees profit dip on China gambling lull,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian casino giant Crown Resorts Ltd (CWN.AX) said on Wednesday its annual profit fell on less gambling by Chinese tourists, and it again denied media reports alleging the company flouted visa rules that have triggered three regulatory probes. Crown is battling multiple headaches stemming from the world’s biggest source of tourists. A spending slowdown in China has slashed turnover, while the allegations of inappropriate visa practices have brought regulatory scrutiny. The company’s normalized net profit, which removes variance in win rates, fell 4.7% to A$368.6 million ($249.7 million) in the year to end-June, just below the A$369.8 million average forecast of analysts polled by Refinitiv. “VIP” sales, largely made up of Chinese tourists on package holidays, fell 26.1%, the company said. The company founded and part-owned by billionaire James Packer said it was working with authorities after media reported last month that Crown hired travel agents with ties to drug traffickers to bring Chinese gamblers to Australia. The reports also said Crown knowingly allowed gamblers to launder money at its casinos and pressured immigration officials to fast-track visas for high rollers. Crown has denied the allegations, which triggered a probe by the gambling authority in the company’s home state of Victoria and neighboring New South Wales state, where Crown is building a new complex on the Sydney waterfront. Australia’s law enforcement anti-corruption watchdog is also investigating the allegations. “It comes as no surprise that various regulators and other agencies have launched inquiries given recent media reports and the sensationalist nature of the allegations raised,” Crown Executive Chairman John Alexander said in a statement. “Crown has zero tolerance for criminal elements and we view these inquiries as an opportunity to continue our cooperation with regulators and other agencies,” he added. Chinese high-rollers have scaled back their spending, reflecting the far-reaching effects of a trade war between the United States and China, which has slowed growth in the world’s second largest economy. “Visitation has been good but average spend has been in decline,” Alexander said on a call with analysts. Crown shares were trading half a percentage point higher by midsession, compared to a 1% dip in the broader market , as investors hoped that the company’s domestic revenue would act as a buffer against volatile package holiday spending. Non-VIP gambling revenue at its main casino in the city of Melbourne rose 1.5% to $1.2 billion, including a 2.8% rise in poker machine revenue. “Crown’s main floor gaming and nongaming revenue has demonstrated resilience, mitigating volatility within its VIP business,” said ratings agency S&P Global Ratings Australia Pty Ltd. Crown maintained its final dividend at 30 Australian cents per share. Reporting by Byron Kaye in SYDNEY and Niyati Shetty and Aditya Soni in BENGALURU; Editing by Darren Schuettler",2.5
1940981,Howard Schultz’s Pitch To Fix America Is A Lot Like His Pitch To Fix The NBA. That Resulted In A Disaster.,"Howard Schultz cheering the Seattle SuperSonics as they play the Vancouver Grizzlies on Friday, Jan. 12, 2001, in Seattle. The news arrived with much fanfare. Howard Schultz, the Starbucks mogul, was going to make a “big announcement, really great announcement,” the public relations staff told reporters. There were “balloons everywhere” and “festive music playing.” What Schultz was doing was cast as “great thing,” a heroic act. It was 2006, and Schultz was announcing that the Basketball Club of Seattle, of which he was the face and the largest stakeholder, had sold the Seattle SuperSonics and the WNBA’s Seattle Storm to Clay Bennett, a businessperson from Oklahoma City. The sale, Schultz said at the time, was the best hope for keeping the team in Seattle. Bennett insisted he had no plans to relocate the team. By the 2008 season, the Seattle SuperSonics were the Oklahoma City Thunder. Steve Kelley, a former sports columnist for the Seattle Times who wrote extensively about the Sonics, recalled it as “the most insulting, disingenuous press conference that I’ve ever been in,” just “lie after lie after lie.” “It was,” he recounted, “the worst day in Seattle sports history.” Twelve and a half years later, Schultz made another announcement. In lieu of balloons, there was a newly formed Twitter account. In lieu of festive music, the tick-tick-tick-tick intro of CBS’s 60 Minutes, where Schultz announced that he was seriously considering a bid for president as a “centrist independent.” The two major parties, he charged, were engaged not in making things better for the American people, but in a “reckless failure of their constitutional responsibility.” Someone “not in bed with either party,” Schultz said, was the best hope for fixing the country’s ills. In the two weeks since, Schultz has been raked over the coals by Democrats, who think a third-party candidate will pull away enough votes from the Democratic nominee to hand President Donald Trump a reelection. Once again, Schultz has become the villain of the story. Schultz’s initial forays into the presidential arena have strong echoes of his early days as the owner of the Sonics. Then as now, he has presented himself as a successful businessperson ready to extend himself beyond Starbucks and remake troubled institutions. Now, Schultz told the Seattle Times when he announced his potential campaign, “I think the American people are longing for and desiring leadership they can trust and a government that is working for them.” Then, Schultz told David Shields, in remarks published in the book Body Politic: The Great American Sports Machine, “If I look at the fracturing of the SuperSonics over the last few years, the word ‘trust’ is all over this thing, because the fans lost trust in this team, the players lost trust in one another, the players lost trust in the organization, the organization lost trust in the players."" Schultz’s presidential bid is fundamentally a quest to change campaign politics as we know it. In New York last week, at an event ostensibly to promote his new book, released a day after he announced his potential presidential aspirations, he posited that an independent candidacy could radically alter how the president is elected. Instead of it all coming down to seven to 10 swing states, he proposed, “What if an independent candidate could create a 50-state race?” Schultz near the end of a game against the San Antonio Spurs during the Western Conference Semifinals during the 2005 NBA Playoffs at Key Arena on May 19, 2005, in Seattle. Similarly, he proposed in 2001, the NBA’s culture and ownership model needed to be overhauled. Like a government that no longer worked for the people it purported to represent, the NBA was not doing right by its fans. “The players too often play selfishly and with a disrespect for the fans and their game. Too often, the owners have made the whole experience of going to a game too commercial,” he told the New York Times then. “The concept of owning and operating a sports team today has to be reinvented,” he added. “What has to be done, essentially, is exceed the expectation of the fan and community."" When Schultz bought the Sonics, fans and sports columnists thought he might be what the team needed. He held “town meetings” with fans to hear their concerns about the team and how the experience of attending a Sonics could be made better. He reduced the cost of tickets to make games more accessible, and reduced the cost of concessions for the first hour of the game. He instituted a policy of letting fans hang out courtside before the game, while the team warmed up. He wrote a cheery, semi-regular column for the Seattle Times about what he was learning as a new owner. ""I don't want to presume that I can come in and do to my basketball team what we've been able to accomplish with Starbucks,"" Schultz said in the 2001 New York Times story about changing the culture. ""But I can try to take a slice of that and bring it to a professional team. Nearly 18 years later, Schultz is careful not to suggest that his experience running Starbucks directly qualifies him to be the leader of the free world. But asked in New York why he’s qualified, he points to his “life experience,” which, he says, “I believe, has given me a level of understanding of people who are falling behind and don’t have access to the American dream and I have been fortunate also to be on the other side of wealth creation, and understanding the responsibility that goes with wealth and power. And I believe I can bring that.” “Howard’s full — sort of like his presidential run now — he’s full of good ideas, but in a lot of ways he’s full of shit,” said Kelley. Speaking to the press following the 2006 announcement that he had sold the team, Schultz confessed to “some naiveté coming in.” From the start, the team was a money suck, losing “tens of millions of dollars” each year, by Schultz’s own estimate. The KeyArena, where the Sonics played, was small for an NBA venue, limiting profits on tickets and concessions. And much of the money that did come in went to the City of Seattle, which had helped fund construction of the KeyArena, leaving a debt that the team had to pay back, plus rent, until the lease ended in 2010. It was, Schultz said at a book event in Seattle last week, in a mea culpa for his role in the Sonics leaving, “the worst professional sports lease, not only in basketball but perhaps in any other sport. And I knew that going in. I had the personal belief, and at the time, the naiveté that I would be able to convince the city council and the mayor that we were buying the team, and that we couldn’t possibly make a profit, but we didn’t want to lose so much money — could we renegotiate the lease to make it more equitable.” By 2004, rumors were circulating that Schultz wanted out. Three years into his “five-year plan” to turn the Sonics into a championship team, the team had made the playoffs only once. In 2003, the Sonics had traded Gary Payton, a 13-year veteran of the team and a future Hall of Fame point guard, after a contract dispute that played out in the press in increasingly personal terms, and culminated with Payton skipping the first day of training camp. On the first day of training camp in 2004, Schultz admitted he had thought about selling the team, but heading into the new season, he told reporters he remained committed. “He always sounds real convincing about how he feels about things,” recalled Kelley. But the KeyArena remained a sticking point. Schultz and the Sonics owners wanted public funding to build a new arena or renovate the current one. It was a luxury that had been afforded, in some form, to the city’s football and baseball teams, and the city council made clear it was not eager to do so again. The offers that were made were deemed insufficient by Schultz and the other owners. “The basic thrust of it was: We like sports, any kind of sports is fine, but the public has to receive a fair handshake, and we need to get back any money we put out,” recalled Nick Licata, then a city council member and a member of Citizens for More Important Things, a group founded in the ’90s to push back on public funding for a facility for the Mariners, and reinvigorated in the fight with the Sonics. “The political powers at the time were not interested in doing anything to help the owners of the Seattle SuperSonics renegotiate the lease or do anything to help us,” Schultz said last week. Efforts to push it through the state legislature were hamstrung by the body’s operating speed. Carl Hirsch, whose sports advisory business consults on things like helping teams get new stadiums built, and who was brought in to help the Sonics negotiate for a new stadium, said Schultz was getting a bad rap. “I do this for a living. I’ve done this in a lot of places, so this is a deal that should’ve gotten done. This is a community that at that time just wasn’t ready to do it,” he told BuzzFeed News. “If you’re asking my opinion, none of this falls to the Sonics as their fault,” he added. “They were very proactive in trying to do it.” Schultz began to say publicly that without a new deal, the current ownership would likely have to sell or move the team. Seattle, said then–NBA commissioner David Stern in an April 2006 conference call, was making clear it was “not interested in having the NBA there."" Schultz presents a jersey to Oklahoma City businessperson Clay Bennett, Tuesday, July 18, 2006. At the press conference announcing the Sonics sale to Bennett in 2006, Schultz cast the sale as a way to keep the team in Seattle, suggesting that Bennett would be better able to negotiate a new arena deal. He thought, he explained in Seattle last week, that the threat of an out-of-state owner moving the team would give Bennett more political leverage. It was a confidence shared by few. On Feb. 10, 2006, the Associated Press had run a story about a group of investors forming a group to acquire a stake in an NBA team with the express purpose of bringing that team to Oklahoma City. ""The bottom line is, we want a team for this market,"" said Bennett, who brought the group together. Nate McMillan, who coached the Sonics for most of the Schultz era, said as much upon learning of the sale. ""I would just think if someone from Oklahoma bought a team, they're going to want to see that team,"" McMillan, who by 2006 was coaching the Portland Trailblazers, told the Columbian. Even Schultz didn’t seem to believe it, Kelley said. “Howard’s a cool dude, and he’s charismatic, and he’s always in control and here he is, he’s got flop sweat,” Kelley recalled, describing Schultz as he went to speak to reporters individually. “Even he understands how crazy this is and how insulting it is to the reporters. And he was sputtering, he was stammering, he was being un-Howardlike. And it was like, ‘What’s going on here? Just tell us the truth.' And he couldn’t. And I’ve never seen him so uncomfortable and off balance.” Schultz, who grew up in New York, was intimately familiar with the pain the relocation of a sports team brought to fans. ""As a young child, there are certain intrinsic events that become part of your sports DNA,"" Schultz recounted at the 2002 Associated Press Sports Editors convention, according to the Seattle Times. ""The Dodgers decided to leave Brooklyn, and my father announced to the family that from this day on, we will not watch, listen or mention the Dodger name in this household. And I remember that as if it was right now."" Schultz’s family became Yankees fans after that. But he rooted for the Red Sox in the 2018 World Series when they faced the Dodgers, according to Gen. Peter Chiarelli, who is working with Schultz and who his nascent political operation put on the phone to discuss the ill-fated Sonics. In New York last week, Schultz described selling the Sonics “the biggest professional mistake I’ve made.” “I’m human, I’m not perfect, I can’t undo it, and I feel terrible about it,” he added. But Schultz evidently did not relish his role as the big bad responsible for sending away the Sonics. “He felt betrayed or hurt by a lot of the columnist-type people in this town,” said Kelley, who spoke to him often when he owned the Sonics. But he heard about those bad feelings through others. “He told everybody else. He never did call. ” Kelley said. Schultz with Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban before an April 2002 game in Seattle. Chiarelli — speaking as someone working on this Schultz effort, but, he noted repeatedly, not for Schultz himself — said he felt Schultz was bearing an unreasonable brunt of the blame. A Seattle native, Chiarelli grew up a Sonics fan — by happenstance, he said, he had worn his Sonics socks to work that day. “I was in Iraq when he sold the team, and I remember reading all the clippings from Baghdad as I was commanding the First Cavalry Division and going to bed crying at night,” he told BuzzFeed News. “This was my team. They were the beginning of my love of professional sports.” But, he said, “I’ve always looked at NBA leadership and Seattle City leadership as being the real culprits here."" “I am not in any way giving him a free pass on what happens,” he went on, but noted that Schultz wasn’t the only owner, nor even the majority stakeholder. “I think for everybody to focus all their ire on Howard Schultz in this thing is, to me, unfair.” “I really believe he learned from his mistakes,” he said. Besides, he said, “If the Sonics ever came back,” as some in Seattle are trying to make happen, “this stuff about Howard Schultz, it would be yesterday’s news.” Many Sonics fans, who still hold a candle for the team, are unwilling to forgive. An apology ""seems pretty insincere and a little late to the game and opportunistic at this point,” said Jason Reid, who along with Adam Brown, produced the 2012 documentary Sonicsgate: Requiem for a Team. At the Schultz book event in Seattle last week, a large crowd formed outside to protest. Reid and Brown were among them. Reid gave a speech, and they handed out DVDs of the film “to virtually anyone who would take them.” The goal of being there, as was the goal of making Sonicsgate, said Reid, was to “hold all the guilty parties toward the wrongs they did to the citizens of Seattle, and the number one villain on the list is Howard Schultz.” “Our wound is still fresh and not healed here,” he told BuzzFeed News. “I was more concerned that he would run as a Democrat and then I’d have to be sort of anti-Schultz when he was running against Trump,” said Reid. In Seattle, the politics has collided with the personal. In 2005, Seattle Times reporter Jayda Evans posed a series of questions to the people who were then the power centers in the Sonics organization, among them: what would you “rather lead, [a] country or [a] company? As Schultz mulls a presidential bid, some are wishing the answer he gave then had been dispositive. ""Since my experience has been based on 25 years of building and leading a company,” Schultz said. “I'll stick with what I know.”",3.0
1941633,Robert Kraft Allegedly Paid For A Sex Act On The Day Of The Patriots' AFC Championship Game,"Robert Kraft, the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots, allegedly paid a spa worker in Florida to perform a sex act on him on the morning of the AFC Championship Game between his team and the Kansas City Chiefs, according to authorities. The Patriots later won. Kraft, 77, has been charged with two counts of soliciting another to commit prostitution. The first-degree misdemeanor is punishable by up to a year in prison, a $5,000 fine, a mandatory 100 hours of community service, and a class on the dangers of prostitution and human trafficking. Kraft is one of more than 300 people facing charges of soliciting prostitutes as part of a months-long prostitution sting on spas in various Florida counties, including Palm Beach County, where Kraft has a home. In addition to the dozens of men arrested for soliciting sexual acts, several parlor owners have also been arrested.Kraft has been issued a summons to appear in court, but does not need to make a public appearance himself, the Palm Beach County state attorney said Monday. On Jan. 19 and 20, Kraft allegedly paid women to perform sex acts on him at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter, Florida, according to a probable cause affidavit released Monday. Orchids of Asia Day Spa Hours before the Patriots were set to play the Kansas City Chiefs in Missouri, Kraft was seen entering the spa at 10:59 a.m. on Jan. 20, according to surveillance video that had been covertly installed by police in the spa on Jan. 17. Kraft — dressed in a dark long-sleeved shirt, blue shorts, and a blue baseball cap — was seen on video paying cash to a woman at the front desk. He was allegedly escorted to a massage room where and he and a woman spa employee hugged each other. After Kraft took off all his clothes and laid face up on the massage table, the woman hugged him again, according to the affidavit. At around 11:02 a.m., the woman ""began manipulating Kraft's penis and testicles and then put her head down by his penis"" for several minutes, the affidavit said. She then wiped his genitals with a towel, helped him get dressed, and hugged him again, the affidavit said. Kraft was seen giving her a $100 bill along with another bill, and he left the room at around 11:13 a.m. He then left the establishment in his blue Bentley, according to surveillance video. He paid spa workers for a similar illicit act the previous evening and left the establishment in a white Bentley, according to the affidavit. Kraft's spokesperson on Friday ""categorically"" denied that Kraft had ""engaged in any illegal activity."" The NFL on Monday said that its personal conduct policy ""applies equally to everyone in the NFL."" The statement said: ""We will handle this allegation in the same way we would handle any issue under the Policy. We are seeking a full understanding of the facts, while ensuring that we do not interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation. We will take appropriate action as warranted based on the facts."" Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was reportedly seen hugging Kraft on Monday morning after they flew from Los Angeles to Boston together in a private jet, TMZ reported. Representatives for Brady did not respond to BuzzFeed News' request for comment. ""These cases aren’t about any one defendant or any group of defendants,” Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said Monday. “The larger picture, which we must all confront, is the cold reality that many prostitutes in cases like this are victims, often lured into this country with promises of a better life, only to be forced to live and work in a sweatshop or a brothel, subject to force, fraud or coercion.” Martin County Sheriff William Snyder told BuzzFeed News on Friday that the ""true monsters are the men"" who frequent these establishments. ""We do not treat these women as suspects,"" Snyder said. ""The true monsters are the men. The men who go in there have the key to their freedom. If they stop frequenting these places, the sex trafficking would stop.""",4.5

1946009,"CBO expects deficit to grow more than projected, warns tariffs could harm growth","Federal deficits are expected to swell to higher levels over the next decade than previously expected, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a new report Wednesday. The CBO also said that President Donald Trump's tariffs are projected to shrink gross domestic product by 2020, and warned that further tariff hikes could stifle economic growth. The U.S. budget deficit is expected to hit $960 billion in 2019, and average a whopping $1.2 trillion per year between 2020 and 2029, according to the CBO's look ahead at the U.S. budget and economic outlook over the next decade. The new deficit projection for 2019 rose $63 billion from the last report, which came out in May. The CBO says this is mainly because of the massive new budget deal, which passed both houses of Congress and was signed into law by Trump in early August. ""The nation's fiscal outlook is challenging,"" CBO Director Phillip Swagel said in the report. ""Federal debt, which is already high by historical standards, is on an unsustainable course."" Swagel said that the debt is projected to rise even higher after 2029, due to the aging of the U.S. population, growth in health-care spending and rising interest costs. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the new CBO report. Trump regularly touts the strength of the U.S. economy and the stock market, suggesting it be used as a barometer for the success of his own presidency and a case for his reelection in 2020. The president has pushed back on reports that an economic slowdown could be on the horizon, claiming that Democrats and the media are trying to create a recession by worrying investors. But Tuesday afternoon in the Oval Office, Trump offered both fiscal and monetary policy proposals to give the economy a boost. He once again trashed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and reiterated his call for a full percentage point cut in interest rates. He also floated the possibility of a payroll tax cut. Trump's remarks would appear to clash with Swagel's prescriptions for addressing the U.S. fiscal outlook. ""To put it on a sustainable course, lawmakers will have to make significant changes to tax and spending policies,"" such as increasing revenues, reducing spending or a combination of both, Swagel said. And while his trade war with China rages on, the CBO also says that the tariffs imposed under Trump since January 2018 are expected to make U.S. GDP roughly 0.3% smaller than it otherwise would have been. ""Trade policies"" are weighing on economic activity, ""particularly business investment,"" the CBO said. The slowdown in growth in 2019 largely stems from weaker growth in business investment, according to the report. Tariffs affect business investment ""by increasing business' uncertainty about future barriers to trade and thus their perceptions of risks associated with investment in the United States and abroad,"" the CBO said. ""If trade barriers rose higher or concerns about such developments increased, domestic investment and output could be slower than we project,"" the agency added. The CBO's projections come as the Trump administration gears up to slap new tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of Chinese imports. Trump has already imposed 25% tariffs on about $250 billion in Chinese goods, and has vowed to apply 10% duties to roughly all remaining Chinese imports by mid-December. Some of those tariffs will go into effect Sept. 1, while other were recently delayed until Dec. 15 to avoid harming U.S. consumers during the holiday season, according to the president. Beijing has retaliated by taxing about $110 billion in U.S. imports, and more recently by announcing that it would no longer buy U.S. agriculture products. -- CNBC's Jacob Pramuk contributed to this report.",3.5
1946161,Negative-yielding debt poses major risks for investors,"Government bonds aren't the only instruments producing negative yields these days, with corporate debt recently passing the $1 trillion mark in a continuing sign of global financial displacement. Investors these days are facing huge amounts of fixed income instruments that carry no yield. Various estimates of sovereign debt in that category put the total in excess of $15 trillion, a number that has been escalating over the past several years while central banks drive interest rates to zero and below. Negative-yielding corporate debt, though, is a relatively new thing, rising from just $20 billion in January to pass the $1 trillion mark recently, according to Jim Bianco, founder of Bianco Research. The trend poses a potentially dangerous threat, especially if market winds shift and bond holders looking for price gains rather than yield get stuck holding too much risk. ""The interest rate risk that these bonds carry is huge,"" Bianco said in a recent interview. ""The financial system doesn't work with negative rates. If the economy recovers, the losses that investors would take are unlike anything they've ever seen."" Negative yields have been confined to places outside the U.S., though some Federal Reserve officials have toyed with the idea at least in a hypothetical sense. Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan recently jolted some investors when he said there was nothing actually standing in the way of negative U.S. rates. Most of the negative-yielding corporate debt is in Switzerland, while some also is in Japan, Bianco said. Investors don't actually pay to borrow money, but the negative yield is symbolic of how much above par investors are willing to pay for these bonds. That's because those who buy negative-yielding bonds are essentially making a bet that rates will stay low and prices will rise, which is the traditional relationship when it comes to fixed income. Should rates start to rise even a little, that will start to eat into the capital appreciation that bond holders have been enjoying. For instance, Bianco said, if yields on Swiss bonds go up just 2 percentage points, it would amount to a 50% loss for holders. While some individual investors might be able to absorb such losses, they would be catastrophic for institutions. On the sovereign side, Germany is the starkest example of negative rates, with yields all along the curve there trading below zero. That has pushed prices up dramatically. In Tuesday trading, buyers were paying the equivalent of $195.87 for every $100 in 20-year German bunds, all for a technical yield of minus-0.386%. Bianco attributes the negative-yield trend to entities including the European Central Bank pumping money into the financial system and pulling investors along for the ride. ""They've so flooded their financial system with money that there's not enough alternatives,"" he said. ""That's why you have people paying such astronomical prices that you wind up with negative yields."" On the corporate side, the picture isn't much prettier outside the U.S. The $27.8 trillion of non-U.S. dollar investment grade global debt is collectively yielding just 0.11%, according to Hans Mikkelsen, credit strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Of all global investment grade debt delivering any yield, 95% is from the U.S. ""We continue to think there is a wall of new money being forced into the global corporate bond market,"" Mikkelsen said in a recent note to clients. ""The trigger is lower interest rate volatility or simply the passage of time, as a lot of foreign investors are being charged (negative yields) for being underinvested."" Mikkelsen said there's investment opportunity at the front and back ends of the yield curve. Investors worried more about recession should be taking on U.S. investment grade debt with short duration, while those more confidence in the economy should focus on longer-term instruments. He said he prefers investments ""out the curve"" as he sees recession probability lower than what is currently being priced in. U.S. credit quality remains good, despite the influx of corporate bonds into the market. Nonfinancial business debt was at $6.4 trillion at the end of the first quarter, a 73% increase from mid-2009 when the current expansion began. However, as a portion of equity it's only 33.7%, from its recession peak of 69% in early 2009. Covenant protections, or the buffers investors demand in case of default, are at record lows, according to Moody's Investors Service. However, default rates are projected to remain low — 2.9% for the year ahead, compared with the long-term average of 4.7%.",3.0

1957931,"John J. Riccardo, Former Chairman of Chrysler, Dies at 91","John J. Riccardo, who as chairman and chief executive of Chrysler recruited Lee Iacocca before stepping aside as the automaker neared bankruptcy, died on Saturday in Ann Arbor, Mich. He was 91. His family confirmed his death. Chrysler was in turmoil by the time Mr. Riccardo took over in 1975. The Arab oil embargo had sent shock waves through the American auto industry in 1973, as high gasoline prices and long lines at the pump prompted many consumers to turn to foreign-made imports that were more fuel-efficient. Chrysler, at the time, was caught flat-footed, with cars like the New Yorker, a four-door sedan that was a shade over 19 feet long and weighed more than two tons. Beyond that, Chrysler did not have the resources of its much bigger domestic rivals, General Motors and Ford, and it faced safety and environmental regulations from an increasingly assertive government. Lynn A. Townsend, Mr. Riccardo’s predecessor, said Chrysler needed a new leader because it faced a new era in which “it will have to change substantially.” Mr. Riccardo, an accountant who joined Chrysler in 1959, did not have an easy time ahead. He was known as “the flamethrower,” in recognition of the tough, aggressive way he approached his job and demanded performance from those under him, The New York Times reported when he was named chairman and chief executive on July 8, 1975. One of his biggest priorities was to fight back against what he saw as excessive government regulation. Within weeks of becoming chairman, he made a speech in Michigan in which he argued that the federal government’s increasing interest in safety and the environment imposed unnecessary burdens on manufacturers like Chrysler and were a threat to the nation’s prosperity. Chrysler’s research, he contended, showed that new emissions standards were “substantially more stringent than necessary to protect the public health.” Failing to bring that research to the attention of the public, he said, would be “the worst form of corporate irresponsibility.” Still, it was Mr. Riccardo who gave the green light to develop a new generation of smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. He approved $700 million to build the new front-wheel-drive vehicles known as K-cars, introduced in 1980. The alternative was to spend about $300 million less on an existing rear-wheel-drive design. “For a company facing the genuine possibility of bankruptcy, it was an almost unbearable call, and it was John Riccardo’s responsibility to make,” David Halberstam wrote in his 1986 book about the auto industry, “The Reckoning.” But it would not be Mr. Riccardo who made the K-car a success. That job fell to Mr. Iacocca, the brash Ford executive who was largely responsible for the Mustang, and whom Mr. Riccardo recruited to be Chrysler’s president in 1978. Mr. Riccardo retired in September 1979, as Chrysler was trying to persuade the federal government to bail it out of its financial problems. The company’s request for a $1.2 billion package of loan guarantees had already been denied once by President Jimmy Carter. In announcing his retirement, Mr. Riccardo cited poor health. But he also worried that remaining as chairman might make winning approval for government aid more difficult. “In the minds of many I am closely associated with the past management of a troubled company,” he said. He was replaced by Mr. Iacocca, who quickly championed the K-car. To the federal government, he offered it as evidence that Chrysler could adapt. To consumers, he appeared in advertisements with the daring line, “If you can find a better car, buy it.” Mr. Riccardo’s bet would pay off. The next year, Chrysler was given $1.5 billion in federal loan guarantees. And in 1983, Chrysler paid off its loans, about seven years early. K-cars like the Dodge Aries and Plymouth Reliant had been “instrumental in the financial recovery of the company,” Chrysler said at the time. They would also pave the way for the company’s next success. In 1984, the mechanical underpinnings would form the basis for an innovative family vehicle the automaker called a minivan — a new form of car that would be broadly imitated. Mr. Riccardo was born on July 2, 1924, in Little Falls, N.Y., to Mary and Peter Riccardo. His father was a bicycle maker. Mr. Riccardo, who lived in the Detroit suburb of Birmingham, Mich., is survived by his wife, Thelma; and five children, Mary Kay Billington, Terry Riccardo, Lynn Duffy, Peter Riccardo and the Rev. John Riccardo. In World War II, Mr. Riccardo drove a truck for the Army on the Burma Road. He received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in economics from the University of Michigan. After joining Chrysler in 1959, he rose quickly through the ranks to become president in 1970, five years before becoming chairman. But his departure was swift as well — driven, Mr. Iaccoca would later say, by Mr. Riccardo’s desire to see Chrysler get the government bailout and survive. “But one thing was perfectly clear: John was sacrificing himself to save the company. He was over his head and he knew it,” Mr. Iacocca wrote in “Iacocca. An Autobiography” (1984). “He blew himself out of the water to bring Chrysler back to life. And that is the test of a real hero.”",4.0
1959750,"Rocket Suggests North Korea Made Small Gains in Technology, South Says","SEOUL, South Korea — The rocket launched by North Korea on Sunday had a longer range and carried a heavier payload than the one used to put a satellite in orbit in 2012, indicating that Pyongyang had made modest advances in its rocket technology, the South Korean Defense Ministry said on Tuesday. The launch on Sunday was condemned by South Korea, the United States and other countries, which consider such efforts by the North to be a cover for developing intercontinental ballistic missile technology. The rocket, the Kwangmyongsong, or shining star, put a satellite into orbit nine minutes and 29 seconds after its takeoff from the Tongchang-ri launch site in the country’s northwest, according to Defense Ministry officials, who briefed journalists on the condition of anonymity. It resembled the Unha-3 rocket that North Korea used to launch a satellite in 2012, but the officials said the satellite on Sunday was heavier. The ministry’s analysis indicated that the new rocket, if successfully reconfigured as a missile, could fly more than 7,400 miles with a warhead of 1,100 to 1,300 pounds, compared with 6,200 miles for the Unha-3 launched in 2012 — in both cases, far enough to reach the West Coast of the United States. But North Korea has never flight-tested a long-range ballistic missile, which requires technology that enables a warhead to survive re-entry into the atmosphere. It is also unclear how close North Korea has come to miniaturizing a nuclear bomb so it could be mounted on a missile. The North’s 2012 launch was its first successful attempt to put a satellite into orbit, but South Korean officials later said that the satellite appeared to be tumbling out of control and that the North was unable to communicate with it. The Defense Ministry officials said on Tuesday that it was too soon to tell whether the satellite launched on Sunday was functioning normally. After the 2012 launch, South Korea said it had salvaged the wreckage of the rocket’s first stage and found that many of its components were off-the-shelf items made by other countries. The first stage of the rocket launched on Sunday disintegrated over the ocean west of South Korea, in a deliberate effort to ensure that it could not be recovered and analyzed, the Defense Ministry officials said. Also on Tuesday, President Park Geun-hye spoke by telephone with President Obama and later with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, reaffirming their intent to push for “strong and effective” new sanctions against North Korea at the United Nations Security Council, Ms. Park’s office said. They also agreed to pursue additional sanctions independent of the United Nations, Ms. Park’s office said.",3.5
1965054,Iran’s Missile Tests and the Nuclear Deal,"Iran has infuriated American critics over the past few weeks with missile tests that skeptics say violate a United Nations Security Council resolution and call into question Iran’s commitment to the landmark nuclear agreement that took effect in January. The critics, including members of Congress from both parties and the Republican presidential candidates, say the Obama administration was naïve in asserting that the nuclear deal would lead to a more amicable atmosphere with Iran after more than three decades of enmity. Q. Is Iran honoring the agreement? A. Yes, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear-monitoring arm of the United Nations. The agency reported on Feb. 26, in its first assessment since the deal took effect, that Iran is complying with the terms that are meant to block pathways to a nuclear weapon. Q. How do we know Iran is not cheating? A. The agency has a detailed accounting of Iran’s sharply reduced supply of nuclear fuel, working centrifuges and other equipment, and is empowered to monitor them. “The agency’s job is to make sure there is no backsliding,” said Daryl G. Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, a nonproliferation advocacy group based in Washington. Q. Are the missile tests prohibited under the nuclear agreement? A. No. Such launchings are considered a separate issue. Q. Are critics correct that Iran has violated provisions of a Security Council resolution banning missile launchings? A. That depends on your interpretation of the resolution, 2231, adopted in July, that put the nuclear agreement into effect. That measure terminated all other resolutions that had penalized Iran for its nuclear program, but it called on the country to refrain from engaging in ballistic missile activity “designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons.” Iran contends that the wording does not prohibit launchings and that since it has no nuclear weapons, there is no violation. Q. What is the Obama administration doing, if anything, about the missile tests? A. American officials contend that Iran may be in violation of Resolution 2231 and that they may bring a formal complaint to the Security Council, which could lead to new sanctions. Other critics have called Iran’s behavior an ominous sign. “If Iran sees it can violate U.N. missile sanctions with no consequence, it will violate this nuclear deal too,” said Representative Ed Royce, a California Republican who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and is a leading skeptic of Iran’s promises. Q. Iran’s parliamentary elections last month were supposed to have strengthened moderate supporters of President Hassan Rouhani, the architect of the nuclear deal. So why is Iran provoking its critics by testing missiles? A. The tests have been carried out by the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which endorsed the nuclear agreement but rejected any constraints on missile tests. If nothing else, the launchings demonstrate the Revolutionary Guards are not under Mr. Rouhani’s control. Q. Regardless of who is carrying them out, how does Iran justify the missile tests? A. While the United States and its Middle East allies accuse Iran of meddling and being threatening, and of sowing regional instability, Iran says it is a peaceful nation surrounded by hostile powers. The United States Navy’s Fifth Fleet patrols the Persian Gulf. American forces are deployed in Iraq to the west, Afghanistan to the east and in other regional neighbors including Turkey, Bahrain and Qatar. Iran has especially poor relations with Saudi Arabia, its biggest regional rival. And Iran regards Israel, which possesses nuclear weapons, as its most intractable enemy. Q. When should the United States expect to see tangible benefits from the nuclear deal? A. Proponents argue the most important benefit — an Iran with no nuclear weapons — is already obvious. Iran remains off limits to most American businesses because many other non-nuclear sanctions still apply. The nuclear agreement did permit a resumption of some types of commerce, most notably sales of civilian aircraft. Q. What if the next president of the United States wants to abandon or renegotiate the nuclear deal with Iran? A. The next president theoretically will be free to renounce the deal, but experts in nonproliferation and multinational agreements say the consequences could be onerous for the United States and damaging to its credibility. The nuclear deal also was negotiated by other big powers and has the force of international law because it was approved by the Security Council. Many countries in Europe have since resumed commercial activities with Iran, including purchases of Iranian oil. Any unilateral attempt by the United States to reimpose sanctions on Iran would likely fail because of resistance from American trading partners. An answer in a Q&A article on March 11 about whether Iran’s recent missile tests call into question its commitment to the landmark nuclear agreement reached last year with world powers misstated the official position of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps concerning the agreement. The corps endorsed the agreement, but opposed any constraints on Iranian missile tests; it did not object to the agreement as an infringement on Iran’s sovereignty. Another answer in the article reversed the location of Iraq and Afghanistan relative to Iran. Iraq is to the west, and Afghanistan to the east.

1967267,Something Is Missing in High School Hazing Stories: Adults,"Sports of The Times BERWYN, Pa. — On my way to Conestoga High School last week to learn about accusations of brutal hazing by the football team, I felt as if I’d been to this place before. I hadn’t been to Chester County. That’s where Thomas P. Hogan, the district attorney, charged three high school seniors this month with crimes related to an assault inside their football team’s locker room. But this scene, this issue, was all too familiar. Young athletes accused of behaving badly, criminally badly, because of a twisted group mentality, and a town that is left both stunned and divided. On my way to the prosecutor’s office, I cut through southeast Pennsylvania farmland dotted with silos and gentle hills. Then I headed to Conestoga High School, past quaint and quiet downtowns and busy strip malls. The school is about 25 miles west of Philadelphia, yet it seems a world away. After school, children were playing lacrosse, ultimate Frisbee and baseball on nearby fields while parents read newspapers in the parking lot. Down the street from the school, a long line of students and families waited at Handel’s Homemade Ice Cream and Yogurt, as students and families have been doing for years. Now Conestoga High School is the latest data point on a grim tally: ■ Three high school basketball players were charged in Sevier County, Tenn., in December with raping another player with a pool cue so violently that the boy had to undergo surgery because of the extent of his internal injuries. ■ Four high school wrestlers in Norman, Okla., were charged in February with raping two other wrestlers, including one 12-year-old boy, in a school bus on the way home from a tournament. ■ In Leechburg, Pa., the police are investigating a high school basketball team for a hazing ritual involving what it called a stick, which possibly had been used for 10-plus years to penetrate younger teammates. The list goes on. I came to Chester County to inquire about “No Gay Thursdays,” the term the district attorney says players used for the hazing. One Thursday in October, the prosecutor said, a freshman player was held down and assaulted with a broomstick as seniors poked him between the legs with it, eventually penetrating him while teammates looked on. Some in the community rose up to defend the players, saying the victim was a bad and cocky kid who had caused trouble before. Others said the issue should have been dealt with by school administrators, not the police. News trucks lined the school’s parking lot, prompting the principal, Amy Meisinger, to hold class assemblies last Wednesday, so she could address what was happening. “The principal told us, ‘We can’t let this ruin our pride for ’Stoga, because we are very proud of our school and our accomplishments, and you should be, too,’ ” said Aubrey Taicher, a junior at the school. “I think she is absolutely right. Besides, nobody really believes any of the accusations really happened.” What makes the accusations especially jarring for Conestoga is that the high school has a reputation as one of the best in the state, but not for its sports — for its academics. Every year, it proudly announces where its graduates are going to college, and the lineup is always impressive. Last year, for example, according to the school district, four students went to Yale, four to Princeton and five to Columbia. This year, the list might include juvenile detention. Neither the principal nor the school district’s superintendent, Richard Gusick, returned my telephone calls or responded to written messages. But Mark Cataldi, the district’s director of assessment and accountability, said in an email that the district was “in the process of investigating a serious matter.” Hogan, the district attorney, wanted to talk about the case, though. He wants everyone to know about it. He took the case public, though its documents are sealed because the defendants are juveniles. He told me that if hazing can happen at Conestoga, it can happen anywhere. He played sports, and he has two teenagers who play sports. He told me he felt it was his job to make the facts of this case known, so it can raise awareness about hazing and protect athletes from this recurring “hazing garbage,” which he sees as a growing problem. “If you want to have a kid stand up and sing a silly fight song, then it’s all right, or let the freshmen carry the Gatorade onto the practice field, go ahead,” Hogan said. “But kids have to stop doing things that will have lasting physical or psychological damage to other kids.” When investigating this case, Hogan did a quick Internet search for other cases and was floored by what he saw. Hazing cases were popping up all over the country. Why so many? Susan Lipkins, a psychologist and an expert on hazing, said it was happening because hazing is a sports tradition that has endured for generations, and coaches and administrators often let it happen. The adults in the room — well, they leave the room and let the mayhem ensue. Lipkins said coaches considered hazing a way for their team to bond — and that bonding supposedly helps them win. Those adults also have an “it happened to me, so it will happen to you” attitude about hazing and just consider it a part of sports, she said. “Most of them think that hazing provides a form of bonding, a form of discipline, and is a way to maintain the hierarchy,” Lipkins said. “It’s a management practice, and coaches just look the other way.” Coaches who leave students in charge of their own locker room are basically leaving “the inmates in charge of the asylum,” she said, adding that the adults in charge are only asking for trouble when they leave teenage boys unsupervised because those boys are often testosterone-fueled and power-hungry, a perfect combination for hazing to occur. According to Lipkins, hazing episodes have grown more violent and sexual — including, at times, the use of broomsticks, golf balls and pine cones covered in Mineral Ice — because those doing the hazing try to put their mark on the tradition, so they take it to an even more wicked level. An obvious fix, it seems, is to make adults accountable. Require them to be present in, or at least within earshot of, the locker room and to ride on team buses. Force them to realize that it’s their job to keep their athletes safe. Otherwise, they won’t have a job. Parents, too, have to be vigilant about what their children are up to; they shouldn’t just hand them over to coaches with blind trust. From Hogan’s perspective, every locker room should have a coach in it. And everyone who even hears about a ritual like No Gay Thursdays — including Conestoga’s coaches, who Hogan said “must have known” — should take a stand against it. He said he hoped this case would at least remind families, coaches and administrators that hazing is a problem. To stop it, he said, people must be proactive. In Conestoga’s case, the coaches were in offices down the hall and around the corner. So it’s possible they didn’t hear the assault occur. But did they know about No Gay Thursdays? Sam Bouhdary, a senior lacrosse player, said that the phrase No Gay Thursdays did “float around the school,” but that no one took it seriously. He said he was friends with some of the football players but hadn’t heard of any hazing going on. He doesn’t doubt, however, that it is a continuing problem on some other teams, in other places, because he’s read about it in the news. “Getting rid of it is not as easy as, let’s say, doing a simple algebra equation,” he said of hazing. At some point, let’s hope that the denial will give way to proper supervision. “No one wants to talk about it,” Hogan said. “They want to say not in my high school, not here. It’s a dirty little secret that gets swept under the rug, and I say, no more.”",3.0
1967494,"Spin-Splaining, Lindsey Graham Edition","Politicians and the consultants who get rich off them devote enormous time and energy to “spin”: the effort to convince reporters and sometimes the general public that they should believe a fabricated version of events rather than their own eyes and ears. Spin is never really convincing, but certain attempts are so completely lame that they make you laugh and then stick in your mind. My personal favorites include Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York telling his constituents in 2014 that they should not be upset with him for disbanding his much-publicized anti-corruption committee because it was never actually intended to do anything in the first place. And I will never forget Secretary of State Jim Baker, who had been brought into the White House in 1992 to save President George H.W. Bush’s doomed campaign, telling reporters on an airport tarmac in Wyoming that we should believe that Mr. Bush would win because Mr. Baker, we all knew, was “far too cynical to associate myself with a losin’ campaign.” Now comes Senator Lindsey Graham, who, you may recall if you pay too much attention to politics, was running for president for a while until he got beaten pretty much everywhere by pretty much everyone else in the Republican nomination contest. During his campaign, he told the world that Donald Trump was a fool and a dangerous one to boot. He said that his fellow senator, Ted Cruz of Texas, was also dangerous and that the rest of the Senate hated him. Now he is backing Mr. Cruz, so it’s time for some spin. His fellow senators, Mr. Graham explained earlier this week, are “afraid of Trump’s voters and they hate Cruz.” But, he said, “if I can swallow my pride, they can, too.” Surely he can come up with something better than that.",4.0
1971206,"Donald Trump Invokes Memories of ... 7-Eleven? - First Draft. Political News, Now.","Join us for New York primary live updates. BUFFALO — On the eve of New York’s primary, Donald J. Trump told a crowd here that he wanted to talk about something close to his heart. “I was down there, and I watched our police and our firemen, down on 7-Eleven, down at the World Trade Center, right after it came down,” Mr. Trump said on Monday evening. “And I saw the greatest people I’ve ever seen in action.” Mr. Trump did not seem to realize that he had invoked a chain of convenience stores, and the crowd did not seem to mind. He continued speaking without hesitation, recalling the bravery he witnessed after the attacks. But he quickly drew some attention on social media for misspeaking. Mr. Trump was addressing an enthusiastic crowd at an arena, the First Niagara Center, where he was introduced by the head coach of the Buffalo Bills, Rex Ryan. After recalling the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Trump explained that he wanted to talk about “the New York values that we all know so well” — offering a very different take on those values than Senator Ted Cruz. “Despite its problems, we love this state,” Mr. Trump said. “We know it’s going to come back. If I’m president, it’s going to come back so fast, you won’t even believe it.”

1972836,"North Korea Sentences American to 10 Years for Spying, Reports Say","SEOUL, South Korea — An American who has been held in North Korea since October was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor on Friday for spying and other offenses, news agencies reported from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. The man, Kim Dong-chul, is the latest United States citizen to receive a harsh sentence in North Korea, which has often used Americans held there as leverage in dealing with Washington. His sentencing came a month and a half after North Korea sentenced an American college student, Otto F. Warmbier, to 15 years of hard labor for trying to steal a political banner from his hotel in Pyongyang. Mr. Kim’s sentence was handed down by North Korea’s Supreme Court, meaning that it is final and cannot be appealed. The verdict was reported by China’s state-run Xinhua news agency and the Japanese news service Kyodo. The State Department has not explicitly confirmed Mr. Kim’s detention in North Korea, saying that discussing such cases publicly does not help its efforts to free Americans held in the North. But the North has released a copy of Mr. Kim’s American passport, and officials in South Korea said Mr. Kim was a Korean-born American citizen. In March, Mr. Kim appeared at a government-arranged news conference in Pyongyang and apologized for trying to steal military secrets in collusion with South Koreans. The South Korean spy agency has denied any involvement in such a plan. Mr. Kim’s predicament was not known until January, when the North Korean government allowed CNN to interview him in Pyongyang. At that time, Mr. Kim identified himself as a 62-year-old naturalized American citizen from Fairfax, Va.. He said he used to run a trading and hotel services company in Rason, a special economic zone that North Korea operates near its borders with China and Russia. He said he was arrested in October while meeting with a former North Korean soldier to receive classified data. Over the years, North Korea has detained several Americans on accusations of illegal entry or spying and other so-called anti-state crimes. It has often given them lengthy prison terms before eventually freeing them, sometimes after visits by high-profile Americans, like former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.",3.5
1973149,Politico Pierces the ‘Brussels Bubble’ With U.S.-Style Coverage,"BRUSSELS — The offices of Politico Europe, the Brussels outpost of the American political news organization, are less than a five-minute walk from the Maelbeek subway station where a suicide bomber killed more than a dozen people in the terrorist attacks here last month. The niche publication normally focuses on the inner workings and power dynamics of the European Union’s sprawling institutions, so acts of Islamic terrorism are not exactly its standard offering. But to Matthew Kaminski, Politico Europe’s executive editor, it was an event that lent itself naturally to Politico’s brand of swift, flood-the-zone news coverage. “We have the biggest newsroom in this town,” Mr. Kaminski said of the more than 40 journalists now under his command, “and this was a hit on our community.” Before the bombings, sharp coverage in Politico had already branded Belgium a failed state, after it was revealed that last November’s terrorist attacks on Paris had also been organized in a neglected neighborhood of central Brussels. The sustained scrutiny in Politico, addressed to an international, English-speaking audience, rankled many in Belgium’s famously parochial establishment — as the more deferential members of the country’s French- and Dutch-language media looked on. Just three days before the Brussels attacks, a spokesman for the prime minister dismissed Politico’s analysis on Twitter as “biased as always.” “We were on site, pushing that button every day,” said Ryan Heath, a senior correspondent who writes Politico’s widely read Brussels Playbook newsletter. “It had a multiplier effect,” Mr. Heath said, “and that did not go down well.” The Brussels attacks punctuated what had already been an unusually newsy first year for Politico’s European venture, which was started last April in partnership with the German publishing group Axel Springer. In addition to terrorism and security, subjects like the migration crisis, the ongoing war in Ukraine, grinding debt talks with Greece and the prospect of a British exit from the 28-member European Union not only kept the Continent in the headlines but also served to remind Europeans — and the rest of the world — of the importance of the often arcane policy debates taking place in Brussels. Much like the original Politico, which was founded in 2007, its European incarnation covers its beat like a village paper, harnessing the immediacy of the Internet to deliver breaking news at a brisk tempo to a core readership of political and civic insiders. Its granular coverage of everything from ministerial summit meetings to regulatory committee hearings is leavened with tidbits from errant emails and restaurant recommendations, as well as revealing anecdotes about the biggest power brokers in Brussels. “We don’t want to just write about politics, but about why these different actors are doing the things they do,” said Carrie Budoff Brown, a former White House reporter for Politico who is now the managing editor in Brussels. As a digital-first news outlet, Politico Europe uses its website as a shop window. Politico.eu offers a mix of free news and analysis as well as a menu of premium Politico Pro subscription channels focused on topics such as energy, health care and technology policy. It is a hybrid of free and for-pay offerings that has been copied from Politico’s successful American operation, said Shéhérazade Semsar-de Boisséson, the managing director in Brussels. So far, she said, it has exceeded its shareholders’ expectations both for audience and revenue. “We didn’t really know how many readers inside the ‘Brussels bubble’ there would be,” said Ms. Semsar-de Boisséson, the former publisher of European Voice, a narrowly focused, policy-driven weekly that she sold in 2014 to Axel Springer and that was supplanted by Politico Europe. Politico Europe claims an audience of one million to 1.5 million unique monthly visitors to its free website, 30,000 readers of its weekly print newspaper and about 200 institutional subscribers to its Pro products, whose potential user base numbers in the “tens of thousands,” Ms. Semsar-de Boisséson said. Compared with other English-language publications with a reputation for in-depth, if not exclusive, coverage of the European Union — and that cater to a global audience — Politico has a modest reach, especially relative to the size of its newsroom. The Financial Times, with a staff of five in Brussels, claims to reach 2.1 million readers every day in print and online, of whom close to 800,000 are paying subscribers. Politico Europe says it is the quality, not the size, of the readership that matters most. About 20 percent of its readers live and work in Belgium, its largest European market, followed by about 11 percent in Britain and 9 percent in Germany. “We produce a kind of news for insiders that gives them the juice that they can use,” said Mr. Kaminski, who came to Politico from The Wall Street Journal, where he worked for more than a decade in Paris and Brussels. Readers of Politico’s specialized Pro services include officials and staff from all the major branches of the European Union, as well as senior members of governments, corporations and consultancies. Pro subscriptions, which can run into the tens of thousands of dollars a year, generate 30 percent of Politico Europe’s revenues; the rest comes from ads and branded conferences. Brussels Playbook is the European equivalent to the free morning email started by Politico’s departing star Washington reporter Mike Allen, and like its American forerunner, it serves as the site’s reportorial marquee. Compiled before dawn by Mr. Heath and sent out to 50,000 inboxes before the morning commute, Playbook is a briefing delivered in a jocular “Daily Show” style. “Everyone reads it,” conceded Peter Spiegel, Brussels bureau chief of The Financial Times. “It has really become the thing that starts the daily conversation here.” It has also transformed Mr. Heath, an Australian who is a former spokesman and speechwriter for the European Commission, into Politico’s de facto public face and a minor celebrity in Brussels. “It means you’re spinning a lot of plates,” Mr. Heath said one recent morning as he raced from the newsroom to deliver a live update for CNN on the bombing investigation. But beyond the general and widespread praise for Playbook, Politico’s European reception has been mixed. Its zest for short-shelf-life scoops and its frequent focus on personalities have led some to dismiss its coverage as incremental and shallow, with little relevance to readers outside Brussels. “Some of the coverage is a bit superficial and doesn’t always get to the heart of the matter,” said Jon Worth, a communications consultant in Berlin and longtime blogger about European affairs. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, for example, was upset by a Politico article last year about his battle with kidney stones, which he later derided as “peep-show journalism.” Jean Quatremer, who covers European politics for the French daily Libération, said in an email, “Politico is firing on all cylinders to get people talking about them, and they are succeeding.” But, he added, “it’s too sensationalistic, too into hyping up small stories.” Tara Palmeri, a former writer for The New York Post’s gossip column, Page Six, who now covers the European Commission for Politico, was quick to shrug off such criticism. “We are making them famous. We’re making them relevant, even when we are being critical,” Ms. Palmeri said of the leaders she covered. “We are telling the stories that make them human and even sort of interesting.” Mr. Kaminski said Politico recognized the need to attract new European readers beyond Brussels and to that end was already recruiting staff to reinforce the small bureaus it has in London, Paris and Berlin. Two new Playbook-style newsletters were also recently started: Morning Exchange, which covers the European corporate and financial world, and Morgen Europa, a German-language politics briefing. “The news has been very helpful in making everyone see that Europe is not done,” Mr. Kaminski said. “And it’s not boring,” he added. “It’s a work in progress.”",4.0
1974651,"Trump Tower Acquires a New Allure, Even for New Yorkers","Since its debut in 1983, Trump Tower has belonged for New Yorkers to the same galaxy, if not the same constellation, as the Plaza, the United Nations and Donald J. Trump himself: part of the urban firmament, perhaps, yet largely irrelevant to daily life. Not many city residents had ever cared to venture inside the 68-story building at Fifth Avenue and 56th Street, unless to visit the in-house Starbucks. That was then. With the ascent of its owner and developer as the favorite for the Republican presidential nomination, Trump Tower has attained some of the trappings of a true city landmark, drawing the same mix of scorn and reverence as its occupant in chief. It has the tourists, more eager than ever to see the celebrity candidate in his natural habitat; it has won the fleeting, semi-grudging attention of New Yorkers, who now regularly pause outside the doors for selfies. And in a city that has never hesitated to unburden itself, it has become a 664-foot magnet for a series of protests large and small, the slightly more verbal equivalent of one long Bronx cheer. It is an unlikely — and unruly — bit of urban theater for a block better known for Audrey Hepburn’s early-morning window-shopping, just next door, in “Breakfast at Tiffany’s.” In September, a protester dressed in a Ku Klux Klan-style hood and carrying a “Make America Racist Again” sign scuffled with Trump Tower security guards. In December, roughly 200 more protesters marched there. In mid-March, on the day Mr. Trump racked up victories in three state primaries, demonstrators assembled a large sign on the sidewalk outside that asked Mr. Trump to “Build Kindness Not Walls.” The next day, dozens of anti-gun activists held a die-in on the same spot to protest Mr. Trump’s assertion that he could “stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody” and still accrue votes. The largest protest so far came a few days after that, when hundreds marched from the Trump International Hotel and Tower at Columbus Circle to its Fifth Avenue sibling. Technically speaking, the tower lobby is public space, if privately owned — one of more than 500 privately owned public spaces that litter the city. Though the Trump Organization was recently forced to remove a Trump kiosk on the main floor that the city said violated the zoning agreement that made the lobby public, it is unclear whether the designation allows for protest. Owners are allowed to set their own rules for the spaces, said Jerold Kayden, a Harvard urban planning professor who has written about them, as long as they are “reasonable.” The Police Department did not respond to requests for comment on the protests at Trump Tower, or the challenges of policing the building. On this super-deluxe stretch of Fifth Avenue, where Bergdorf Goodman, Harry Winston, Henri Bendel and other elders of retail Olympus make their home, Mr. Trump’s brand of bedazzlement, particularly since the advent of Trump 2016, can make for an alarming fit. Yet an unscientific survey of several Bergdorf’s saleswomen, nearby security guards and a pedicab operator found that the campaign had not brought much disturbance to the avenue. But even in the absence of formal demonstrations, the building often inspires spontaneous political discourse. “We’ve been watching the news about him on TV here,” said Karen Latter, 54, who, with her husband and two daughters, was visiting from Leicester, England, where Mr. Trump also tends to monopolize the airwaves. “To be honest, it doesn’t come across well.” “Not at all,” agreed one of her daughters, Suzanne Latter, 24. “We find his name funny, actually.” She explained that in their part of England, “trump” is slang for passing gas. But Trump Tower receives its share of more respectful visitors, including a registered Democrat turned Trump volunteer named Al Wilson, who had enlisted an 18-year-old friend of his granddaughter to hand out pro-Trump fliers on the sidewalk. (“Don’t give it to the tourists,” he instructed his apprentice, thus ruling out nearly everyone in the vicinity. “They can’t vote.”) He was proud, he said, to claim the mogul for their shared hometown. “I never met Donald in person,” Mr. Wilson said, “but I feel like I have, because I grew up around him in New York.” Inside, where Starbucks-sipping tourists leaned against the lush salmon-pink marble walls, there were few hints of Mr. Trump’s White House aspirations beyond the “Make America Great Again” baseball caps for sale and a single campaign sign, glimpsed in an open elevator. Not that the building left any doubt as to the identity of its creator. (It is more discreet about its other residents, who at one time included Chuck Blazer, the former soccer official now entangled in the federal investigation into FIFA, soccer’s global governing body. Mr. Blazer, The Daily News reported, kept two apartments at Trump Tower: one for himself, and one for his cats.) Double rows of golden T stickers gilded the doors; a concierge stand bore two giant Ts. Trump Bar offered cocktails, Trump Grill a $23 prix fixe menu. Glass cases displayed Ivanka Trump’s jewelry line, Trump-branded cuff links and a book, “Trump Tower,” that advertised itself as “The Sexiest Novel of the Decade.” “Inside, it’s, like, all mirrors,” observed Kendall Wright, 19, a Mercy College student who had not explored Trump Tower, beyond the Starbucks, until last week. Other appraisals have been mixed — more so since Mr. Trump’s ascendance in the delegate count. Yelp, to take one measure, gives Trump Tower a three-star rating out of five. (There was, however, universal applause for the cleanliness of the public restrooms.) “This was definitely a tall building, but much left to be desired upon entering,” Rebecca W. of Baton Rouge, La., wrote in January. (Three stars.) “You really sense the wealth that dwells in its brass walls,” Jason M. of Manhattan wrote in July 2014. (Five stars.) “Money clearly can’t buy you good hair,” Terri S. of Carmel, Ind., wrote in early April. (One star.) In Mr. Trump’s absence, some of the gawkers and the haters settled for John Thomas, doorman to Trump Tower for eight hours a day. For the masses, he is the next closest thing — bow tie, striped waistcoat, white gloves and all. He estimates that he is photographed in front of the brass-edged glass doors roughly 100 times a day. “I’ve had some people take pictures of me,” he said on a recent afternoon, shortly after linking arms with two grinning young women for the camera’s benefit, “and then they send me the picture back, and I’m part of their Christmas card.”",3.0
1975892,"After Etsy, Scratching an Itch","13 Photos View Slide Show › CATSKILL, N.Y. — Rob Kalin made the bed he sleeps on, the cob oven for the bread he bakes with near religious fervor, the progressive preschool his twin daughters, Zia and Kora, attend on the onetime dairy farm he bought three years ago and his own underwear. In the five years since Mr. Kalin was forced out of Etsy, the global online crafters’ marketplace he founded in 2005, which went public last year, he has been trying to make a life here that matches his values. In a former mill and furniture factory in two 19th-century buildings that stretch from Main Street to the Catskill Creek behind it, he has assembled a small community of artisans engaged in the same challenge. Whether he and they can make a living doing so, and at the same time raise the fortunes of their adopted town, is still being debated, he said. “There’s two very different versions of value,” Mr. Kalin said. “There’s the Walmart and McDonald’s version, which is price and convenience, and then there’s values, and that part is really hard. We’re not purists. We are trying to be practical. But this is a challenge.” Mr. Kalin, 36, is still the soft-spoken D.I.Y. evangelist he was 11 years ago when he and two friends, Chris Maguire and Haim Schoppik, created their handmade community in his Brooklyn apartment. (By the time he left Etsy in 2011, it was a venture capital darling with revenues over $40 million.) The other day, he was standing in the storefront of the mill buildings he bought out of foreclosure a few years ago, the fallout of a failed condominium project, without knowing exactly what he may do with them. “What’s a good use for buildings like this in a town like this?” he asked himself. “I’m still figuring it out.” The property he has named the Catskill Mill is enticing and deceptive looking: The modest storefront on Main Street unfolds into a 20,000-square-foot warehouse connected by a steel-truss bridge enclosed in glass to a 55,000-square-foot warehouse on the creek. Mr. Kalin’s initial thought was to create Catskill-branded products: objects like housewares and furniture made from local materials. Who would make them, and how local is local? Should the place be a co-op, or would craftspeople work for Mr. Kalin? He and Trevor Babb, an artist who was living in California, spent a week camping in the desert talking it through, and then Mr. Kalin persuaded Mr. Babb to move here. Mr. Babb and Mr. Kalin are kindred spirits. Mr. Babb, 38, makes cunning Old World “disaster kits” — steamer trunks and wooden boxes filled with supplies, tools and materials, like seed libraries — for the end times; he calls them “fantastical provisions for the post-apocalyptic homestead.” In 2009, when he had a show of this work in Red Hook, Brooklyn, Mr. Kalin bought a piece called “Shelter,” a sculptural object made from a large hunk of wood embedded with axes, picks and machetes, and they became friends. Mr. Babb also makes exquisite leather luggage. Mr. Kalin makes refined wood furniture of Shakeresque simplicity, and extremely high-end horn speakers and other bespoke stereo components with Jeffrey Jackson, 43, an engineer and hi-fi designer from Memphis, who moved his entire family (and his collection of World War II-era electron tubes and other audio arcana) here to collaborate with Mr. Kalin. “Jeffrey is one of a half-dozen people who understands this stuff,” said Mr. Kalin, introducing Mr. Jackson, a lanky man with a shock of curly brown hair. Mr. Kalin can seemingly make anything. (Well, knitting still confounds him, he said, as do bagels.) Not too long ago, he made a unisex tunic he colored with cochineal — a carmine dye yielded by insects that live on cactuses, a favorite of the Aztecs — in shades from bubble-gum pink to a dark royal purple. He made the tunics for friends, enjoying the intimacy of fitting a garment to a loved one, and he made one for himself, hoping it would give him a more Roman silhouette, he said. “But it ended up looking like a shift dress.” (Photos he sent prove otherwise: In purple knee socks and scuffed leather boots with straps and buckles, he looked rather like an extra from “Ben-Hur.”) Mr. Kalin has had a foothold here since 2008, when he began renting a 1920s duck hunter’s camp on a finger of land overlooking the Hudson as a weekend place. Not that he got up here much. In Brooklyn, he was sleeping on the floor of the unheated warehouse that was Etsy’s office. In 2009, when he was first able to sell his stock in Etsy, he bought the house with the proceeds. By then, he was dating Layla Delridge, who was working on a D.I.Y. sewing website in the same building as the Etsy office. Mr. Kalin has been on his own since he was 16, when he left home to work in a photo shop (he wanted to be a photographer) and live in an artist’s squat with an uncle in Boston. His parents were divorcing, and he was bullied in school. He did return to high school and is proud to tell you he graduated with a D average. Afterward, he spent a year at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, while sneaking into art and design courses at M.I.T. using fake ID cards he and a friend had made for themselves. (He crashed classes at Harvard, too, because there was a girl there he was interested in, but found them too boring to continue.) He later moved to New York and worked at the Strand bookstore and for a construction company, among other jobs, while sneaking into night classes at the New School. Eventually, he graduated from N.Y.U.’s Gallatin School of Individualized Studies with a concentration in classics. When he and a classmate, Mr. Maguire, made a website for the founder of Getcrafty, a how-to site for the booming indie-craft movement, Mr. Kalin had an idea to create a digital marketplace for these new makers. As for the name Etsy, its origins are still a mystery. It has been reported that Fellini’s “8½” will yield a clue, or that the name is a play on the Latin for “What if?” (Et si?) Mr. Kalin remains mischievously closemouthed. “Gee, I plumb forgot,” he said. Either way, Etsy was perfectly tailored to the movement at the time: an agora for the whimsical and the twee (crocheted toilet paper, anyone?), as well as for the useful and the beautiful, like handmade clothing, ceramics and furniture. (Perhaps inevitably, Regretsy, a blog parodying its most out-there wares, like felted vulva necklaces, appeared.) Along with a virtual storefront, Etsy offered its sellers skill- and community-building workshops and residencies. While its community grew exponentially each year, and Mr. Kalin and Mr. Maguire were joined by Mr. Schoppik and Jared Tarbell, Etsy soon struggled under the ambitious idealism of Mr. Kalin, always an eccentric chief executive. In 2008, he hired Maria Thomas, a senior vice president for digital media at National Public Radio, to help focus the business; he then stepped aside and offered her his job. Two years later, he stepped back into the role, only to be fired by his board in 2011. “Rob is more of an artist than an entrepreneur, but the two are similar and related,” said Fred Wilson, a founder of Union Square Ventures and an early investor in Etsy. “They both require risk taking and doing things differently.” Five years ago, Mr. Kalin said, he could have talked about being “sacked for days.” “Now, I’m just really grateful for my experiences with Etsy, and I’m so glad I’m not the C.E.O. of a publicly traded company,” he said. “I got off the ride not when I thought I would, but I take a very karmic view of things. If the universe gives you a hint and you don’t listen, it gives you a kick.” Mr. Kalin and Ms. Delridge moved here full time the year he was fired and got married; their daughters were born in 2012. The couple are now separated, and Ms. Kalin runs an avant-garde fashion boutique in Hudson, N.Y. “We are trying to be kind to each other and just be good parents,” Mr. Kalin said. “Having kids is a gigantic emotional reset. It’s been a clarion call for me to try and figure out the way I want to live my life for my kids. This town of just under 12,000 has welcomed Mr. Kalin and his collaborators, said Kay Stamer, the executive director and founder of the Greene County Council on the Arts. After the blows of the last recession, “we are on the upswing again,” she said. “Not the least of it is thanks to Rob and Trevor and company, who have opened their hearts and space to us.” The town may still be searching for its cultural identity, said James Male, the principal of House Hudson Valley Realty, but Mr. Kalin has been a course correction for the place. “The cultural identity that it’s wrapping its arms around now is crafts, the arts and dance,” Mr. Male said. Last year, his office sold a 19th-century former lumberyard complex to the American Dance Institute, now based in Maryland, which plans to turn it into a performance space and artists’ housing, opening in 2018. Mr. Male and an associate, Michele Saunders, have been selling Main Street properties to artists relocating from SoHo, Brooklyn and Beijing, he said, with prices about half what they are in nearby Hudson. “My clients who want to be ‘over there’ don’t want to be in the hubbub of Hudson,” he said. “People who could live anywhere they want choose to live in Catskill, because it’s still under the radar. It also has a great food truck.” Not anymore. In 2013, Mr. Kalin bought a food truck and hired a chef to create a Vietnamese menu for it, as a way of sticking his toe into the waters of food service. “But it was hard to make money,” Mr. Babb said. “We had all these limitations. We need to use locally sourced materials. We need the packaging to be compostable. We need to pay everyone a living wage, and we need to keep the prices low so everyone in Catskill can afford it. Which is basically impossible economics.” They ran the truck for two seasons, a humbling experience, Mr. Kalin said, recalling mishaps like the night the truck broke down minutes before a benefit. “We made amazing food and fed a lot of people we cared about, but even in its best month, it lost about two grand,” he said. All during this time, Mr. Kalin, Mr. Babb and others were working to clean and stabilize the mill areas. They were trying various scenarios: Could they make and sell local products under one house brand — clay, leather, textiles and wood, for example? “We had a metal shop for about a minute,” Mr. Kalin said, but it was too noisy, and metal is tricky to source locally. They hired Margot Becker, a 29-year-old fiber artist who lives across the river in Hudson, as a consultant to set up some looms for them and work through, as she put it, “some fiber-processing ideas: What does it mean to make something from start to finish? What does it mean to be a hand artisan, and how does one make a living? Also, how do you fit that into Catskill, whose economy isn’t New York City? Paying the right amount for a woven thing that’s been made from start to finish is a huge luxury.” Kurt Holsapple, 65, a local furniture maker who met Mr. Kalin when he built him a kitchen, came on board as well, to the delight of the everyone. Mr. Holsapple, a free spirit and charmer who describes himself as “dyslexic and colorblind, with a touch of Asperger’s,” makes graceful wooden furniture and fine art from natural materials that look like miniatures by Robert Smithson. The recession here had hit him hard. “I went into foreclosure while I was doing Rob’s kitchen,” he said. “I was picking up side jobs, but I couldn’t make enough to pay my taxes, so I just gave up on paying my mortgage. When Rob found out, he was just setting up the mill and said, ‘Let’s invite Kurt.’ I had $200 when I came in. I do feel very lucky to be here, because at my age, he’s giving me a chance to not worry about making money for a few years. “Rob is a patron, in a sense. This has been like going back to college, but I’m the old fart.” Three years ago, Mr. Kalin bought a former dairy farm on 300 acres near his property. With a group of parents, he created a preschool there. In the cathedral-like Dutch barn he is restoring, he hoped to put an elementary school, but adhering to building codes would have meant destroying the character of the old timber framing, so he is searching for other options. In 2014, he bought another property, a ravishing but derelict 1812 brick townhouse that’s nestled behind Main Street and across from the warehouse on the creek. “We went through 18 different possibilities,” Mr. Babb said of the house. “It’s a bakery! No, it’s a bakery and a cafe and a fine-dining restaurant. No, it’s none of those things. It’s an elementary school. No, it can’t be that because it’s too close to a local bar. O.K., it’s just a house, but who’s going to live there? O.K., I’ll live there! But Rob’s like, ‘You can’t live there; you can’t be a plantation owner. It can be a guesthouse. No, you can’t have an empty guesthouse, you can’t not rent it out. O.K., it’s a B&B, and oh, it’ll be like a showroom, too. Wait, it can’t just be a retail setting, that’s too tacky. …’ This is how we think.” The plan now is to turn the house into a B&B filled with goods that have been made by Ms. Becker, Mr. Holsapple and others, so that guests can live with the wares of the Catskill Mill. Dishware and other ceramic pieces — including the sinks — were made by Asia Sosnowski, a 27-year-old ceramist, from clay dug out of Mr. Kalin’s land. Sconces and chandeliers are being designed by Laleh Khorramian, 42, who also makes handmade garments like mommy/baby quasi-space-age resort wear. Mr. Kalin commissioned these pieces — furniture and towels and rugs and ceramics — from their makers and may commission more, he said, though the present arrangement has the artisans concentrating on their own work in studios set up throughout the Main Street warehouse. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Kalin had made enough bread to send a few loaves home with a photographer and a reporter, who were eating handfuls of it and standing around an elegant butternut dining table and benches. The furniture was made by Mr. Holsapple and Mr. Kalin, and set in the mill’s storefront. Mr. Kalin disappeared to find wrapping for the bread and was gone a bit longer than you would expect it to take to find a suitable container. As it happened, he was making bread bags, which he sewed from muslin scraps and then signed, faintly, with his initials. “At one point, I created too much here,” Mr. Kalin said, noting his habit of stretching himself too thin. “A friend said, ‘When the phone rings, you always answer it.’ But if you aim too high and try to come in a little bit lower, you’re still way up in the clouds.”",3.5
1979735,Shirley Ann Jackson: Keep Your Eye on the North Star,"Corner Office This interview with Shirley Ann Jackson, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant. Q. What were your early years like? A. I grew up in Washington, D.C., a child of the ’50s and ’60s. So when I started school, the schools were segregated by law. After the famous Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954, Washington immediately integrated the schools the next year. A tracking system was put into place, and we were tested in the sixth grade. Based on that, I was placed in an accelerated program. I ended up being my high school valedictorian. I was pretty quiet in many ways but always assertive. When I was young, I used to organize the kids on the block to actually sweep the sidewalk before the street-sweeping truck came. It just seemed like the thing to do. I don’t know why they would do it, frankly, but somehow they did it. I would say to them, “Why have the streets clean if the sidewalks aren’t?” I also did experiments as a kid. I started with collecting bees in our yard and doing little environmental and dietary experiments with them. I always tried to let them go before they died. I never wanted a dead insect collection. Tell me about your parents. My father started working after the 11th grade because his father had passed away. He was always mechanically gifted. My father was in World War II — in a segregated unit, and he was at Normandy. He ended up getting a Bronze Star because in the battle, he was able to repair the amphibious landing vehicles that the troops came in on. The rudders kept breaking. Other people had tried different things, but they would come apart, and he figured out a particular way to splice cables that worked. That saved a lot of lives. He used to work on projects all the time, and I spent a lot of time with him when I was young. My mother was the one who made sure we all were really good in the language arts. She taught us to read before we went to kindergarten. Any favorite family expressions? My father always said, “Aim for the stars so you can reach the treetops.” Then he always said that the way you get your next best job is to do as well as you can in the one you’re in. What were some important leadership lessons for you? It’s important to know when one is the leader and when one is the follower. Even if you lead an organization, there are times you follow other people. I certainly learned that as chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. I also learned — because I had to testify before Congress a lot, starting with my own confirmation hearings — that it’s very important to be consistent in messaging. Not necessarily rigid, but consistent, because the words mean something. The last thing is that a lot of people talk about sticking to your guns and having the courage of your convictions, and it is true. You can’t second-guess yourself every day, but at the same time you cannot be so arrogant as to never change your mind. What advice do you often give when you’re coaching managers? It’s important to listen carefully, because it helps you understand the other person, and you cannot expect to really reach them if you do not understand. Listening can also help you make better decisions because nobody is the fount of all knowledge. The second is empathy. The world is complex, and people come from various backgrounds. I have my own sensitivities based on how I grew up. Sometimes I let them get the better of me, but I learned an important lesson early on. As a freshman at M.I.T., I did volunteer work in a hospital in Boston, in the pediatric ward. I was feeling kind of down at the time because I was this African-American woman and people weren’t always so great to me. But the volunteer work was important because it kept me grounded. You’re with these little kids who have all these ailments. There was a little blond-haired baby who had no face. He had just sockets for eyes. His nose was very deformed. He had a mouth to eat, but it was deformed, too. Nobody ever came to see him, at least that I could see. But every time I was finished with all the other things I had to do, I would just go hold him. It helped me realize that sometimes my own demons can get the better of me, but that everybody has a burden they carry. It’s important to understand that. How do you hire? I ask people just to tell me about their lives — how they grew up, and how they got to where they are. What I really am looking for is self-discernment. How seriously they take what they do versus taking themselves too seriously. What career and life advice do you give to new college grads? You start out with a trajectory, a direction. But you have to understand that there are a lot of forces along the way that can change the trajectory. But you try to keep your eye on that North Star and understand why you started down the path in the first place. And you can’t lose your confidence. That’s easier said than done, but one way to do that is even when you’re doing something hard and not feeling totally successful, you should find something in the work that you can be successful at and just do it. The other thing is not to stew about things. Stewing doesn’t help you because then you miss opportunities. None of us love what we do every day of the week and every hour of the day. Any favorite expressions of your own? It’s not original, but I like this one: “If you don’t come down off the porch, you can’t run with the big dogs.” You’ve got to be in the game. You can’t be afraid. I had many days of my own self-doubt, but I’ve always been willing to try.",3.5
1982618,"Chinese Activist Chen Yunfei Is to Stand Trial, Lawyer Says","BEIJING — A longtime political activist and artist who has been detained for more than a year in China after visiting the grave site of a victim of the violent Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 is expected to stand trial on Thursday, according to his lawyer. The activist, Chen Yunfei, 48, uses performance art to criticize the Communist Party and is a close friend of other Chinese intellectuals, including the author Liao Yiwu, who lives in Germany and is also from Mr. Chen’s home province, Sichuan. Mr. Liao has written about Mr. Chen’s detention. The authorities have charged Mr. Chen with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” The police in China have been using the charge in many prominent cases against dissidents. The police also wanted the court to try Mr. Chen on a charge of “inciting subversion of the state,” but that charge has been dropped. In 2013, the top legal bodies expanded the definition of the “picking quarrels” charge to include online writing, and the security forces have wielded it as a legal weapon against liberal voices on the internet and people carrying out protests or other acts judged to be overly critical of the party or the state. A document from prosecutors that was posted by Mr. Chen’s lawyer accuses Mr. Chen of taking advantage of having tens of thousands of followers on Twitter to “start rumors about and libel against our country’s political system on the internet many times.” Twitter is among the foreign websites blocked in China. Mr. Chen calls himself a “beast tamer,” using the term beasts to refer to the Chinese authorities. He has been especially active in trying to keep alive the memory of the massacre of civilians by the military around Tiananmen Square in June 1989. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people were killed after party leaders ordered the People’s Liberation Army to quash anticorruption and pro-democracy protests started by students. Mr. Chen witnessed the bloodshed. Mr. Chen was detained on March 25, 2015, shortly after visiting the grave of a student, Wu Guofeng, who was killed by soldiers in Beijing in 1989. Mr. Chen had traveled to Mr. Wu’s grave site in Xinjin County, Sichuan, with a group of activists and Mr. Wu’s relatives. Xinjin is the home county of Mr. Wu. By early April last year, the police had formally charged Mr. Chen. On Friday night, Ran Tong, Mr. Chen’s lawyer, posted a message on his microblog saying Mr. Chen’s trial was expected to start at 10:30 on Thursday morning at Wuhou District People’s Court in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan. In May 2015, Mr. Liao wrote a blog post for the Independent Chinese PEN Center, which advocates free speech, expressing concern over the detention. “I fear for you, Chen Yunfei, but there is nothing else I can do,” Mr. Liao wrote. “Please forgive my cowardice.” Mr. Liao wrote that “the Communist Party’s bestial nature has resurfaced, time and again,” especially under the rule of President Xi Jinping. Mr. Liao interviewed the parents of Mr. Wu in 2005 and wrote about his death in a book, “Bullets and Opium.” Mr. Liao wrote that Mr. Wu, 20, had ventured into the streets of Beijing from his campus in the early hours of June 4, 1989, to photograph the events taking place. In an encounter with soldiers, he was kicked to the ground and fatally stabbed with a bayonet, Mr. Liao wrote. Mr. Wu was said to have gripped the bayonet with both hands before dying. Maya Wang, a China researcher for Human Rights Watch, mentioned Mr. Chen’s case in a post in May 2015 that discussed a broad crackdown on artists. She wrote that under the “twisted logic” of the Communist Party, “there is no reason to spare artists.” “The government has brought censorship to a new level, retaliating against both rumor and humor that depart from official lines,” she added.

1983543,"Handel and Hendrix, Side by Side","Born: Nov. 27, 1942, Seattle, Wash. First job: Enlisted in the United States Army in 1961 but was discharged after getting injured in a parachute jump; in mid-1960s, played backup for Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson, Little Richard and others. Early hits: “Hey Joe,” which reached No. 6 on the British charts in 1967. Why he moved to London: Brought to England in 1966 by Chas Chandler of the Animals, who helped create the Jimi Hendrix Experience, which teamed Hendrix with the British musicians Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell. Built his reputation in London clubs. Lived on Brook Street: At No. 23 from June 1968 until March 1969 (with touring in between). Greatest hits: The albums “Axis: Bold as Love” (No. 3 in the United States in 1968) and “Electric Ladyland” (No. 1 in 1968); performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at Woodstock in 1969. Personal style: Flowing shirts, psychedelic prints, military-inspired jackets, headband, jewelry. Indulgences: Hard to know for certain, but it was the 1960s; Mateus rosé, Benson & Hedges cigarettes. Death: Inhalation of vomit following barbiturate intoxication, Sept. 18, 1970, at age 27 in London. Musical legacy: Widely acknowledged as the greatest rock guitarist ever. The influence of his theatrical live shows, searing guitar solos, and blending of jazz, rock and blues can be seen in Prince as well as in generations of air guitarists. Fun fact: Hendrix was a left-hander who played a right-handed Fender Stratocaster guitar upside down. Born: Halle, in what is now Germany, Feb. 23, 1685. First job: Organist at Halle Cathedral at age 17. Early hits: Numerous cantatas, both sacred and secular, and the operas “Agrippina” (1709) and “Rinaldo” (1711). Why he moved to London: His patron, George, the elector of Hanover, was heir to the British throne. After taking several trips in the early 1710s to London, a wealthy capital with money to spend on the arts, Handel eventually settled there permanently. George succeeded Queen Anne in 1714. Lived on Brook Street: At No. 25, from 1723 until his death in 1759. Greatest hits: “Messiah,” “Water Music,” “Zadok the Priest.” Personal style: Bewigged and powdered. He was often referred to as old-fashioned, and his clothes were identifiably Germanic. Indulgences: Claret wine and hot chocolate: Handel was said to tend toward “healthy corpulence.” Death: In failing health and blind, at home on Brook Street at age 74. Musical legacy: Largely responsible for the popularity of the oratorio; influence can be seen in Mozart and Haydn. Reassessment in 20th century of his operas found a master of technique and command of many musical styles. Fun fact: In 1704, Handel fought a duel with Johann Mattheson, a singer, composer (and later, critic), after a quarrel over the continuo part in one of Mattheson’s operas.",2.0
1990873,Reasons to Believe the A.I. Boom Is Real,"Bits Artificial intelligence is booming. But why now? Move over, social media and mobility: Silicon Valley has a next big thing, John Markoff writes , and it’s A.I. and robots. It is useful to think of them as part of the same thing, since many robots are autonomous machines programmed for decision making based on A.I. The movement can be thought of as a spread of computing intelligence everywhere, on wheels and wings, in your pocket and all through your house. That’s a big enough idea to fund scores of companies, and quite possibly set up the next Silicon Valley boom. And bubble. Yet it’s worth asking how much of this is reality and how much is wishful thinking. Why is A.I. growing the way it didn’t over the last several decades, despite promises that it would? The answer to that lies in the precursors to this A.I. moment, which more than anything has to do with the Google-led search boom 10 years ago. In 2006, Google and Yahoo released new methods of analyzing the quirky real-world data they were picking up from doing search. Data from browsers can be thought of as a proxy for human behavior, as people wander the web. It’s typically called “unstructured” data, as opposed to the more regular information of things like banking and airline schedules that filled most of the world’s databases. That new way of seeing the real world helped make search profitable and also enabled companies like Facebook to look into even stranger social behavior. The success also gave these companies plenty of money to plow into the problem. To money, and the first ever caches of natural behavior in digital form, add cheaper computing. In 2006, Amazon also introduced its cloud-computing business. Over the last decade, retail cloud computing has become an inexpensive way for lots of people to work on data analysis and pattern finding, the heart of A.I. Only one more thing was needed, and in 2007 Apple came out with the iPhone. Let that stand for browser-type natural data collection moving off desktops and blowing through the natural world. Along with other cheap sensors tied to the cloud, it has given us huge amounts of data about all sorts of things. That created many more places where computers could do what they’ve always done, which is to seek efficiency. That has created a cycle:more observation, more machine learning of patterns, more value capture funding more observation. It’s enough to make you believe in this boom. What could make you believe it’s also a bubble? Start with the name, artificial intelligence. So far there is zero evidence we will be about to build machines that possess intelligence or will really think on their own. If big money goes into that stuff, run for the hills.",3.5
1994525,"How David Maupin, an Art Dealer, Spends His Sundays","Sunday Routine The art dealer David Maupin, who, with Rachel Lehmann, founded Lehmann Maupin in 1996, is in for a busy time. On Sept. 3, the Perfect Earth Project — an environmental nonprofit on whose board Mr. Maupin sits — will hold a benefit at the home of his friend, the photographer Cindy Sherman. Five days later, Lehmann Maupin’s Hong Kong gallery will open an exhibition of David Salle’s new paintings. And plans are underway for Lehmann Maupin to open its third Manhattan gallery. Mr. Maupin, 55, spends summer weekends in Bridgehampton with his husband, Stefano Tonchi, 56, the editor in chief of W magazine and a former New York Times editor, and their 5-year-old twin daughters, Maura and Isabella. MODEL BEHAVIOR I wake up at about 6:30. I make drip coffee (Illy) and have plain yogurt (Siggi’s). We try to eat healthy. It’s important to model your behavior for your children. If I eat any junk food, I eat it on the down low. I don’t let my kids see it. HATE-LOVE WORKOUT I go to the 7:30 SoulCycle class in Water Mill. I kind of hate it, but love it. I find it hokey, but it’s very efficient if you want to get your exercise so you can stuff yourself later in the day. JAM SESSION I usually have fruit. I’m a total coffee addict — or, I like to say, coffee achiever. The girls have yogurt and fruit or yogurt and granola. Since it’s the weekend, we party and have some toast and really good jam — fig jam from Italy. DIVE IN We go to the beach or go into the pool immediately. Isabella is a little bit more of a beach girl, so she and Stefano might go to the beach, and Maura and I go into the pool. We start thinking about lunch. FORAGING Usually, morning is a good time to visit Edwina von Gal, my best friend and an incredible gardener and landscape architect. We go over to her garden and pick some vegetables. We pick carrots and arugula for lunch and dinner. My kids really like that. If it’s a beautiful day, the girls might paddle board with her. LUNCH ALFRESCO We will have lunch at Edwina’s or go back to our house for lunch. We might stop at the Seafood Shop in Wainscott to get some fresh seafood. Or we have lunch at Jenny and Trey Laird’s in Bridgehampton. We have a tight group of friends and we see each other all the time. We eat lunch outside. My kids really like when I grill. Or Stefano will make a pasta, like a clam or calamari pasta. He’s a really good cook. We sit on the screened-in porch. ART, SPORT I might go to visit an artist’s studio or we might take a drive to the Parrish Art Museum. Then it’s more beach and pool time, maybe tennis. My girls have been learning to play tennis, so Stefano and I will play, and my girls will kind of watch and try to hit some balls with us. Isabella has been learning to surf. She stood up yesterday. I have the video, it’s kind of incredible. RELAXING WITH DINNER We come home about 5:30, 6, and start getting ready for dinner. My girls go to bed around 7:30, 8, so we start dinner by about 7, 7:15. We shower in the outdoor shower, then start preparing for dinner. If we have fish at lunch, we’ll usually have steak for dinner or fish again. We eat a lot of fresh vegetables from Edwina or the farm stands. We make corn salad, grill the zucchini, blanch the corn. I love the fact that food is grown out there. I love the fact that there’s fresh fish. Our family relaxes; the light is great. Of course there’s Italian wine. Sadly, my carbon footprint for wine is big. TUCKING IN THE GIRLS After dinner is really nice, reading books with the girls. We usually talk in Italian about the day. If we’re driving back to the city, our kids are so easy — they just go to sleep in the car and we carry them upstairs. If we’re staying over, the girls go to bed. TUCKERED-OUT DADS Stefano and I figure out which movie or television series we’re currently trying to finish watching or want to watch and spend a couple of hours. Right now we’re doing “Mr. Robot.” Then we read and get to bed. We try to make it to 11 because I think that’s a respectable time to go to sleep, but sometimes it’s even 10:30.",3.0
1996907,Ronald D. Boire Steps Down as Chief of Barnes & Noble,"Ronald D. Boire, the chief executive of Barnes & Noble, is leaving the company after a tumultuous tenure that lasted a little less than a year, the bookstore chain announced on Tuesday. Mr. Boire is the third chief executive to leave the troubled company in just three years, after Michael P. Huseby, who resigned in July 2015 and became executive chairman of Barnes & Noble Education and received $10.5 million severance payment, and William Lynch, who stepped down in July 2013. In a terse statement that lacked any attempt at corporate spin, the company said that “the board of directors determined that Mr. Boire is not a good fit for the organization and that it was in the best interest of all parties for him to leave the company.” A spokeswoman declined to provide additional comment. Leonard Riggio, the company’s founder and executive chairman, who had planned to retire next month, is postponing that, and will lead the company along with other members of the executive management team until a successor to Mr. Boire is appointed. Mr. Boire’s sudden departure comes at a critical moment for Barnes & Noble, the country’s largest bookstore chain. In recent years, the company has been battered by Amazon’s rise as a leading bookseller and crippled by losses from its Nook e-reader division. Its fleet of retail stores has shrunk to 640 from 720 in the last six years. Mr. Boire, who previously worked in top posts at Sears Canada, Brookstone and Toys “R” Us, tried to transform Barnes & Noble by expanding its selection of games, toys, art supplies and music and by offering coding and 3D printing workshops. On corporate earnings calls, Mr. Boire often talked about how strong sales of coloring books and vinyl records were bolstering revenue. “Everything we do around learning, personal growth and development fits with our brand,” he said in an interview with The New York Times in December. There were some encouraging signs of stability. The company announced plans to open four new retail stores in the 2017 fiscal year. But the chain has still struggled to recover from its heavy investments in its Nook e-reader, a device that was meant to give it a foothold in the digital marketplace but ended up hemorrhaging money instead. Mr. Boire’s attempts to turn the company’s fortunes around have largely fallen short. In an earnings report for the final quarter of the current fiscal year, Barnes & Noble reported a loss of $30.6 million, or 42 cents a share, compared to losses of $19.4 million, or 37 cents a share, in the same period the previous year. Revenue dropped 3.7 percent to $876.7 million during the period, while Nook sales tumbled 20 percent. Perhaps most troubling, Barnes & Noble’s troubles have persisted even as many other physical book retailers, particularly independent bookstores, have flourished. Sales of books in physical stores grew 1.8 percent, to $4.15 billion, in 2015 compared to 2014, according to the Association of American Publishers. Print book sales have rebounded as well: revenues from hardcover books rose by 8.3 percent last year, while e-book unit sales fell by 9.7 percent.",4.5
2002227,Sounds of Venice’s Serene Republic Come to New York,"When Carnegie Hall presented its first comprehensive celebration of early music — Before Bach, a series of concerts over 25 days last year — it left little room for improvement but plenty to expand the concept. Making the most of its international networks, Carnegie imported some of the finest performers active in Europe, including the viola da gamba wizard Jordi Savall and one of his stellar bands, Le Concert des Nations. In February, Carnegie will follow that outpouring with La Serenissima: Music and Arts From the Venetian Republic, a 19-day citywide, cross-disciplinary festival, which again relies heavily on European performers. Mr. Savall and more of his ensembles — Hespérion XXI and La Capella Reial de Catalunya — will join Le Concert des Nations to kick off the festival in the Stern Auditorium (Feb. 3) with “Gateway to the East: The Millenarian Venice,” a program that ranges through the run of “the Most Serene Republic.” Mr. Savall and Hespérion XXI will add a second concert in Zankel Hall (Feb. 12). [ More classical music this fall: The Met Opera addresses a gender gap, and two string quartets grow up ] Venice is an irresistible draw for early-musickers, as it has been an irresistible port of call for travelers since the days of the Silk Road traders. It was home to composers like the Gabrielis, Monteverdi, Cavalli and Vivaldi, and as the birthplace of commercial opera, it played host to Handel, among many others. So the rich variety of the Carnegie programs comes as no surprise. Neither do the entire concerts devoted to two masters, Monteverdi and Vivaldi. Cappella Mediterranea will present “Angels and Demons,” a vocal evening of music by Monteverdi, at Zankel Hall (Feb. 18), and Concerto Italiano will conclude the festival with a concert performance of his opera “L’Incoronazione di Poppea,” in the Stern Auditorium (Feb. 21). In the Vivaldi program, the Venice Baroque Orchestra and the vocal ensemble Tenet will perform the oratorio “Juditha Triumphans” in Stern on (Feb. 7). The presence of the New York-based group Tenet is notable, as is Tenet’s own concert, “The Secret Lover,” featuring music of Barbara Strozzi (Weill Recital Hall, Feb. 17). The major disappointment of the Before Bach festival in 2015 — with early-music performance flourishing in New York and the rest of the country as never before — was its failure to look beyond a single American ensemble. La Serenissima includes programs by two New York-based instrumental groups, Quicksilver (Weill, Feb. 9) and Carnegie’s own Ensemble Ensemble Connect (Weill, Feb. 20). Other programs feature fine ensembles: the Tallis Scholars (Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Feb. 8); Gallicantus (Weill, Feb. 11); and Il Pomo d’Oro (Weill, Feb. 13, and Zankel, Feb. 14). As for the Ahmet Erdogdular Classical Turkish Music Ensemble (Zankel, Feb. 17), led by the vocalist of its title in music that many Europeans would first have heard in ancient Venice, your guess is as good as mine, but I wouldn’t miss it. Despite its compressed span, La Serenissima boasts vastly expanded ambition in a number of added partner events around the city. Among many other musical outings, Daniel Hyde, the new organist and director of music at St. Thomas Church Fifth Avenue, plays an organ recital at the church (Feb. 4). And Juilliard Opera presents a concert performance of Handel’s “Agrippina” (Alice Tully Hall, Feb. 11), as well as staged performances of the work (the Willson Theater at Juilliard, beginning on Feb. 18). Nonmusical partnerships include a scaled-down version of Shakespeare’s “Othello,” by Juilliard Drama (the McClelland Drama Theater at Juilliard, beginning on Feb. 8) and seminars at the Frick Collection: “The Painter and the Libertine: Titian and Pietro Aretino” (Feb. 15) and “Venetian Paintings in the Frick Collection” (Feb. 16). Other performances, discussions and exhibitions abound. A picture caption last Sunday with an article about fall programs at Carnegie Hall misidentified the location where Jordi Savall was shown conducting. It was the Juilliard School, not Alice Tully Hall.",3.5
2002980,Wall St. Ends on an Upswing,"The market surged on Monday after a Federal Reserve official said the central bank should not raise interest rates too soon. After stocks plunged on Friday, investors bought safe shares, including household goods makers and phone companies. Technology companies also jumped. Stocks started the day lower but soon rallied. Investors were pleased when Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, said the bank should not raise rates quickly because that could hurt the economy. The biggest gains went to safe investments that pay big dividends. Friday’s nose dive came after another Fed official suggested that rates could go up next week. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 239.62 points, or 1.3 percent, to 18,325.07. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 31.23 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,159.04. The Nasdaq composite surged 85.98 points, or 1.7 percent, to 5,211.89. The gains in the three main indexes made up for more than half of Friday’s losses. David Kelly, chief global strategist for J.P. Morgan Funds, said the Fed’s cautious attitude toward raising rates even a little is causing strong reactions. “The more cautious they are, the more sensitive the market becomes,” he said. As investors sought safe picks, Walmart rose $1.64, or 2.3 percent, to $71.94 and Procter & Gamble gained $2.01, or 2.3 percent, to $88.25. Phone companies also rose; AT&T gained $1, or 2.5 percent, to $40.71. Those stocks took some of the biggest losses Friday. Markets overseas took sharp losses. The DAX in Germany fell 1.3 percent while the CAC-40 in France lost 1.2 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain gave up 1.1 percent. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 1.7 percent. United States crude rose 41 cents to $46.29 a barrel. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil trading, climbed 31 cents to $48.32 a barrel. Gold fell $9.10 to $1,321 an ounce. Silver lost 37 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $19 an ounce. Copper gained 1 cent to $2.10 a pound. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.67 percent from 1.68 percent.

2008661,WikiLeaks Lays Bare a Clinton Insider’s Emphatic Cheers and Jeers,"In one note, Neera Tanden groused that whoever had let Hillary Clinton use a private email address for her State Department correspondence should be “drawn and quartered.” In another, she called for Mrs. Clinton to stop stalling on whether she opposed the Keystone pipeline, worrying that “dodging another issue” would hurt her in the Democratic primaries. And when Mrs. Clinton’s team dallied over whether to publicly criticize David Brock, a longtime ally, for demanding Senator Bernie Sanders’s medical records, Ms. Tanden was blunt. “Hillary. God,” Ms. Tanden wrote. “Her instincts are suboptimal.” Ms. Tanden, 46, a longtime policy adviser to Mrs. Clinton, is well known on Twitter and cable news for her peppery defenses of Mrs. Clinton and her sarcastic takedowns of Mrs. Clinton’s perceived adversaries. But her private communications with some of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign aides, stolen from campaign chairman John D. Podesta and published over the last month by the activist group WikiLeaks, have revealed another side. In a sphere encrusted with suck-ups, soothers, and self-puffery, Ms. Tanden has emerged as a loyal but insistent straight-talker and acute assessor of Mrs. Clinton’s stubbornness and weaknesses. “What the emails show is somebody who is passionately invested in Hillary Clinton giving the best possible candid advice she can to advance her electoral prospects,” said Howard Wolfson, a former Clinton aide and a close friend of Ms. Tanden’s. He added, “And giving it privately.” The Clinton campaign declined to comment on the emails, instead saying that the hack was a product of the Russian government’s meddling in the election to benefit Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee. But as dozens of her stolen messages have gone public, Ms. Tanden’s private and profanity-laced commentary has made her something of a cult hero for an unlikely group: Trump supporters. On a Reddit page called “The_Donald,” where Trump backers dissect the hacked email releases and post their findings, Ms. Tanden has garnered a slew of unwanted praise. One Trump fan called for a Neera Tanden fan club. Another dubbed her “NoFilterNeera.” Most of the stolen emails were exchanges between her and Mr. Podesta, her former boss at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank that Ms. Tanden now leads. Mr. Podesta is a longtime friend, and Ms. Tanden’s tone is often that of a colleague grousing in the break room. In the exchanges, Ms. Tanden can be fiercely protective of Mrs. Clinton. When Jennifer Palmieri, communications director of the Clinton campaign, wrote a sharply worded letter raising concerns about coverage of Mrs. Clinton in The New York Times, Ms. Tanden cheered. The letter “is great,” she wrote to Mr. Podesta — adding a sentence laced with profanities directed at the newspaper. But she could also be direct about other members of Clintonworld and the candidate herself. When news media reports began identifying potential members of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign team last year, Ms. Tanden warned of griping among Democrats about racial and gender balance among Mrs. Clinton’s staff picks. “I’m not the diversity police but there is grumbling on the 4 white boys running next presidential cycle,” she wrote in January 2015. “So I recommend rolling out some people who look like the rest of America soon!” In May 2015, New York City’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, emailed Ms. Tanden and Mr. Podesta to let them know that he was scheduled to appear on the MSNBC show “Morning Joe” and would likely offer his opinion of Mrs. Clinton’s policy vision. “I find him a bit insufferable,” Ms. Tanden wrote to Mr. Podesta. (The mayor was frozen out over the ensuing months and denied a prime speaking slot at the Democratic convention this summer.) Ms. Tanden’s internal critiques may have damaged her relationships with other members of the concentric Clinton circles, and in the immutable fashion of Washington, she seems more likely to be punished than rewarded for her honesty. Asked about the WikiLeaks releases, Ms. Tanden said in an email that while she would not authenticate any of the messages, their leaking had been “a profoundly painful experience.” “Having been a bit beaten up in the media over the last month myself, I have even greater appreciation for someone who has weathered it for 20 years,” Ms. Tanden said of Mrs. Clinton, calling her a “role model.” She added, “My personal efforts have been to help her be successful.” Philip J. Crowley, a former Clinton aide at the State Department who resigned in 2011 after publicly criticizing the Department of Defense for its treatment of a soldier accused of classified leaks, said he believed Ms. Tanden would still be welcome in Mrs. Clinton’s inner sanctum. “Will there have to be some conversations and a couple of beers and a mea culpa afterwards?” Mr. Crowley said. “Sure there will. But those who are experienced in the ways of Washington know how to work this.” Some of Ms. Tanden’s sharpest internal criticisms concerned Mrs. Clinton’s private email account, which prompted a federal investigation that is plaguing Mrs. Clinton anew. On Friday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it had uncovered a new trove of emails after seizing an electronic device shared by Anthony D. Weiner and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton. When Ms. Tanden first saw news reports about the private account in March 2015, she exchanged a series of emails with Mr. Podesta bemoaning how they had gotten into such a situation in the first place. She singled out other aides, including Cheryl D. Mills, a longtime senior adviser, for not recognizing the danger sooner. “This is a cheryl special,” Ms. Tanden wrote. “Know you love her, but this stuff is like her Achilles heel. Or kryptonite. she just can’t say no.” As the controversy wore on, Ms. Tanden griped about the White House “crapping” on Mrs. Clinton, and insisted that Mrs. Clinton ought to make a public statement right away. She noted that Mrs. Clinton, after years of enduring attacks and scandals she regarded as trumped-up, had a tendency to be stubborn about acknowledging error. “She always sees herself bending to their will when she hands over information, etc.,” she wrote in August 2015. “But the way she has to bend here is in the remorse. Not the ‘if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn’t do it.’ A real feeling of — this decision I made created a mess and I’m sorry I did that.” In early September, Mrs. Clinton gave a series of interviews in which she apologized for the email issue. Mrs. Tanden joked that after one of the interviews, she “was able to breathe again.” Ms. Tanden was alert to the potential threat posed by Mr. Sanders’s outsider campaign. She cautioned Mr. Podesta that aggressively going after Mr. Sanders could backfire. “Just game out what that does to Hillary,” she wrote in August 2015. “When we went after Obama, she got killed for it. Reaffirmed all her negatives, strengthened him. We had no idea it was kryptonite for us to do that, but it was.” If Ms. Tanden seemed particularly on guard, perhaps it was because she knew what a failed Clinton campaign looked like — and how painful it could be. During Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 presidential run, Ms. Tanden wrote to Mr. Podesta about her malaise as it ended. “I am really profoundly sad today. I thought I was over it,” she wrote. “But here I am sad. She’s not conceding tonight. ... And not anytime soon, either.”",4.0
2011686,New York Buys Last Tract for Williamsburg Waterfront Park for $160 Million,"A patchwork of weeds, rusted refineries, dilapidated warehouses and pollution-soaked land along the East River in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn has long held the unfulfilled dream of local residents. For more than a decade, New York City officials have promised to transform the industrial wasteland into a 28-acre park in exchange for neighborhood support for a rezoning that would allow the construction of luxury residential buildings in what was once a primarily working-class area. In that time, as Williamsburg became a magnet for the wealthy and aspirational, only a portion of the promised Bushwick Inlet Park came to life. Acquiring the land from a host of owners proved to be difficult, fraying the patience of local residents. But this week, officials announced that the city had ended a standoff with the owner of the last 11-acre parcel needed to join the southern and northern ends of the park’s footprint, agreeing to pay $160 million for the property. “It’s a damn miracle!” said Joe Mayock, 50, executive director of Open Space Alliance for North Brooklyn, one of several groups that have pushed for the park. “This isn’t just about a park or even about a neighborhood — it’s about holding the city accountable as it continues to transform.” Mayor Bill de Blasio praised the acquisition, calling it “an investment in the future of Brooklyn” and saying the price was fair. “Our administration keeps its promises,” Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said in a statement. “When we commit to build a new park or a new school in a growing community, we deliver.” The promise to build the park was actually made during the administration of Mr. de Blasio’s predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, a Republican turned independent who estimated the project’s entire cost at $60 million to $90 million. With the deal announced this week, the city will have spent more than $350 million on land and another $25.8 million on development, with much more still needed to clean up decades of pollution on the property. In the end, what stood between the people and their park was Norman Brodsky, owner of the elusive last tract and the fire-damaged warehouse on it. Mr. Brodsky rebuffed the city’s initial $100 million offer for the property and was reportedly seeking as much as $325 million. While real estate experts had placed the land’s minimum value at $120 million to $180 million, the city argued that the only reason it was even worth that much was the proposed rezoning, which depended on the creation of the promised park. The project might well have stalled had it not been for the activists who continued to press for the park’s completion. Spurred largely by a group called Friends of Bushwick Inlet Park, proponents spoke out at community board meetings, held rallies at City Hall and flooded local officials with literature about the cause. When traditional tactics foundered, the activists staged a series of outré demonstrations to capture attention. They occupied the inlet with kayaks and canoes, marched in Manhattan with a coffin symbolizing a funeral for a project, organized and filmed a flash mob at a nearby soccer field and staged a sleep-in on the pavement outside the park during a torrential rainstorm. “Elected officials are inundated with all kinds of issues, but this community wouldn’t take no for an answer,” said Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, who joined Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a fellow Democrat, at the sleep-in. “These people fought like hell and their neighborhood will be better for generations because of it,” Ms. Maloney said. Katherine Conkling Thompson, an organizer of Friends of Bushwick Inlet Park, was among those celebrating the victory at a pub in Greenpoint on Tuesday night. “Sometimes a grass-roots effort can actually succeed,” Ms. Thompson said. She did not bask in the success for long. By morning, she was already focused on her next effort: a proposal to build a park over a portion of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.",3.0

2015000,"Cuomo Commutes Sentence of Judith Clark, Driver in Deadly Brink’s Robbery","Judith Clark, who drove a getaway car in the infamous 1981 robbery of a Brink’s armored car in Rockland County, N.Y., that left a guard and two police officers dead, went into prison defiant, with seemingly little chance of getting out. The judge who sentenced her saw her as beyond rehabilitation, giving her a minimum of 75 years in prison and all but ensuring she would die there. But Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, citing what he called Ms. Clark’s long sentence and “exceptional strides in self-development” commuted her sentence on Friday. Mr. Cuomo’s action does not undo Ms. Clark’s conviction on second-degree murder and robbery charges, but it reduces her sentence to 35 years to life and makes her eligible for parole in 2017. If Ms. Clark is freed, it would be in recognition of her evolution from radical to model prisoner, and serve as a coda to a notorious case that was among the last gasps of violent left-wing extremism seen in the 1960s and 1970s. Ms. Clark, 67, must still win over the parole board, and law enforcement groups are expected to fight her release. Ms. Clark’s efforts to obtain clemency have gained wide attention in recent years, particularly as other participants in the Brink’s robbery have been released or granted parole hearings. Two of those involved, Mutulu Shakur, the stepfather of the rapper Tupac Shakur and described as the ringleader of the holdup, and David Gilbert, a leader of the Weather Underground who was also involved, remain incarcerated. Mr. Cuomo noted that Kathy Boudin, now a professor at Columbia University, was released in 2003 after receiving a 20-year-sentence as part of a plea deal. The commutation was part of a raft of clemencies announced by the governor on Friday, which were hailed by a wide swath of criminal justice advocates. About 100 people who had finished serving time for nonviolent crimes they had committed as minors were pardoned, and the sentences of several other inmates were commuted. The clemency actions were the largest number by a governor in the state’s history, a spokesman said. The governor met Ms. Clark, who had one of the longest sentences of those in the Brink’s case, during a prison visit this year. A range of people have attested to Ms. Clark’s transformation, including Elaine Lord, former superintendent of the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for women, the maximum-security prison where she has spent almost all of her 35 years behind bars. Ms. Lord wrote to then-Gov. David A. Paterson in 2010 that she had seen Ms. Clark “change into one of the most perceptive, thoughtful, helpful and profound human beings that I have ever known, either inside or outside of a prison.” A group of 13 former presidents of the New York City bar association signed a letter seeking clemency for her this year. In the years before the robbery, Ms. Clark had bounced from mainstream civil rights causes to a group called the May 19th Communist Organization, an offshoot of the Weather Underground that believed a black-led revolution was in the offing. She did not quickly renounce her radical ideology once in prison. Deemed a major security risk, she spent two years in solitary confinement after being caught helping to plan an escape. But her attitudes began to change. She earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees while incarcerated, and led educational programs for inmates, including a prenatal course and an HIV/AIDS program. Her release has been opposed by law enforcement groups and by some relatives of the men who were killed in the robbery and ensuing search: Sgt. Edward O’Grady and Officer Waverly Brown of the Nyack police, and Peter Paige, a Brink’s guard. Ed Day, county executive of Rockland County, called the push for clemency for Ms. Clark, “a vicious slap in the face to every member of law enforcement.” “The blood of Nyack police Sgt. Edward O’Grady, Officer Waverly ‘Chipper’ Brown and Brinks guard Peter Paige will be on her hands until the day she dies,” he said in a statement on Friday. “Judith Clark is a domestic terrorist. Her only place in a civilized society is behind bars.” Ms. Clark’s lawyer, Steven Zeidman, said on Friday that his client was aware of the concerns of the victims’ families. “She’s grateful for this opportunity and is very ecstatic, but is very fully aware that it’s painful and difficult for those who lost loved ones that day,” he said. Though Ms. Clark did not fire any shots, she was a willing participant in the robbery, which the militant group viewed as an “expropriation” for what they called the Republic of New Afrika. According to her account from that day, she had parked in a corner of a mall in Nanuet where other members of the group attacked an armored car, grabbing $1.6 million while leaving Mr. Paige dead and another guard in a pool of blood. Gunfire was also exchanged later with the police. Ms. Clark’s radicalism had hardened by the trial. She called herself a “freedom fighter” and called the court officers “fascist dogs.” In an email on Friday, Edward J. O’Grady III, the son of the slain officer, said that he was still processing the news. He called his father a hero and said he felt the pain of his loss every day. But, he said, “the release of Judith Clark will take no more away from me and will bring no more hurt to my life.” He also wrote about Ms. Clark’s daughter, Harriet, a lecturer at Stanford, who was 11 months old when her mother was arrested. “She did no more to deserve her lot than my sisters and I did to deserve ours,” he wrote. “If it brings an end to the suffering that Harriet has to deal with every day, then perhaps I can be happy for both of them, and I can assure you, I’ll still be able to sleep at night.” An article on Saturday about a decision by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to commute the sentence of the driver of the getaway car in the infamous 1981 robbery of a Brink’s armored car in Rockland County, N.Y., misstated the given name of the guard who was killed. He was Peter Paige, not Paul Paige.",4.0
2015438,"For ‘Trollhunters,’ Guillermo del Toro Found Inspiration in the Sewers","WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. — When Guillermo del Toro was 11, he and his friends would explore the vast sewer system below his hometown, Guadalajara, Mexico. Although he never found anything too fantastical on his subterranean forays, the idea of vast cities and civilizations beneath our own has entranced him ever since. Mr. Del Toro, the director of “Pacific Rim” and “Crimson Peak,” returns to the underworld with “Trollhunters,” a 26-episode DreamWorks Animation series on Netflix, starting Dec. 23. The series is set in Arcadia, a fictional American suburb, as well as the secret subterranean city beneath it. In the first episode, a magical amulet chooses Jim Lake Jr. (voiced by Anton Yelchin), a kindhearted and lovelorn high school student, to become the Trollhunter, a protector of good trolls and a scourge of the evil ones. While Mr. del Toro has made his name on scarier, creepier fare like “Pan’s Labyrinth” (a fairy tale populated by sadistic military officers and sentient stickbugs in 1944 Spain), “Hellboy” (an action fantasy film about a demon spawn called up from the netherworld by Nazis) and “The Strain” (a horror TV series starring vampires with stinging, prehensile tongues), “Trollhunters” is decidedly more family friendly. “I wanted to do a series that I could imagine watching with a glass of milk on the couch with my dad and my brothers,” he said. Besides those early trips through Guadalajara’s sewers, Mr. del Toro drew inspiration for the series from cultural references high and low: Jonny Quest cartoons. The early work of Hayao Miyazaki, “back when he was animating for Toho.” Irish folklore and Arthurian legend. Kids movies from the 1980s, like “The Goonies.” Asked about a scene involving a gnome and a dollhouse, he admitted with a laugh that, yes, it did indeed come from the 1963 “Twilight Zone” episode “Miniature,” starring Robert Duvall. Mr. del Toro was at the Four Seasons Hotel here recently, explaining how he incorporated many of these past and present loves into his current venture. Dressed in a black hoodie, black T-shirt and jeans, he looked a lot like the fanboys who flock to see him at comic conventions or who queued up for hours to view his recent exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, “Guillermo del Toro: At Home With Monsters.” Many of the exhibited works there — a fraction of the director’s vast collection of paintings, animation cels, comic books and movie props — shaped his vision of “Trollhunters.” “I do not lead a normal life,” he said. “I spend my day surrounded by creatures.” A lifelong lover of fairy tales, Mr. del Toro recalled a Brothers Grimm story about a king who offered his daughter’s hand in marriage to anyone who could hold her attention. Three brothers go to the kingdom. The youngest is something of a scatterbrain, picking up a piece of string here, a dead bird there. “His brothers laugh at him,” Mr. del Toro said, “but eventually he uses those objects to keep the interest of the princess.” “That’s me,” he continued. “I’ve always got my head in the clouds, looking at the floor, picking up string that nobody picks up, and enshrining it.” Here are four of the magical elements from “Trollhunters,” and a few of the bits of string that informed them. To summon his magical armor and sword, the Trollhunter calls upon a mystical golden talisman, which serves as both a source of his power and a symbol of his high office. Visually, the amulet is “a cross between an Arabian astrolabe and a clock”; its spinning gears evoke “a kind of Arthurian steampunk,” Mr. del Toro said. To make the thing work, its master must speak the magic words, much like Ali Baba’s “Open Sesame,” or Green Lantern’s overly wordy, battery-charging oath. “Every talisman needs an incantation,” Mr. del Toro said. The Trollhunter’s oath — “For the glory of Merlin, daylight is mine to command” — is, of course, straight out of Arthurian legend. “It also hints at some of the deeper origins that we’re going to explore in the series,” Mr. del Toro said. The Trollhunter’s gleaming armor was inspired by the polished chrome beauties in John Boorman’s 1981 fantasy “Excalibur.” In that film, the armor of King Arthur and his knights was constantly bathed in an eerie emerald glow (green lights placed offstage created the effect), a visual signature that Mr. del Toro borrowed for his own. “We did a little nod to Boorman,” he said. “Every time you see Jim, there’s a green light that comes from nowhere.” Unlike with Arthur’s suit, however, no loyal page is required to help put it on: When needed, the armor magically attaches piece by piece to the Trollhunter’s body. “That is complete Japanese animation,” he said, occurring in anime including “Ronin Warriors” and “Erza Scarlet.” In addition to trolls, gnomes and changelings, Arcadia has goblins, lots of them. Mr. del Toro’s vengeful creatures, all flashing canines and skittering little legs, are based on Anglo-Saxon myths going back centuries. (The director consulted a book from his own collection, “British Goblins,” an obscure 1880 tome, to help create his modern-day versions.) One particularly nasty trait of goblins is their habit of stealing human babies from cribs and replacing them with “changelings,” tiny creatures that look like babies but aren’t. In the olden days, iron horseshoes were hung near an infant’s crib to prevent the swap, and a magical horseshoe figures in “Trollhunters,” as well. Their insectlike movements are pure del Toro (reminiscent of the stick insect/fairy in “Pan’s Labyrinth”); their creepy tendency to skitter up walls and ceilings evokes memories of Japanese ghost movies. “It’s very much like yokai,” he said, referring to Japan’s famous and centuries-old spooks. The visual heart of the series, Troll Market is a subterranean metropolis pulsing with energy and jewel-fueled light, where trolls eat, fight and down brews in pubs straight out of Viking lore. The works of the comic book artist Richard Corben inspired the city’s grand scale and purple-and-orange color scheme. “There is a pulp energy to Richard Corben that no one else gives me,” Mr. del Toro said. Every del Toro creation has an underworld, be they cellars (“Crimson Peak”), labyrinths (“Pan’s Labyrinth”) or monster-infested sewers (“Hellboy”). As a child, Mr. del Toro was entranced by the underground treasure troves of “The Arabian Nights”; later, he fell in love with the 1973 made-for-TV movie “The Night Strangler,” which featured scenes shot in downtown Seattle’s famed network of tunnels and passageways. “It spoke about an entire underground city that exists underneath Seattle,” he said. “And I always thought, God, I want to go there. I want to live there.”",4.0
2015746,"How Poppy King, Founder of Lipstick Queen, Spends Her Sundays","Sunday Routine As the founder of the cosmetics brand Lipstick Queen, Poppy King, 44, is always looking for inspiration, even on the weekends. “There’s not an experience that I have where I’m not potentially looking to spark a lipstick concept,” she said. “I never turn off that lens: I can be in the subway or walking down the street and am still thinking of lipstick ideas.” The entrepreneur, born in Melbourne, Australia, has lived in a one-bedroom apartment on a leafy NoLIta street for the past 14 years. BLACK AND WHITE MORNING I wake up about 7, which goes to show that I don’t have much of a night life. I’m definitely an early riser. One of my biggest indulgences on a Sunday morning is watching a movie on TMC, an old black-and-white film or something, on the couch in my PJs. That really gets me in the mood. STREET-SMART COFFEE Then I go and get an almond latte from a fantastic coffee cart called Peddler on the corner of Lafayette and Houston. It’s so quirky — it’s almost like performance art that you can buy coffee from. The owner, Byron Kaplan, has an espresso machine on the street; it’s really unique and it’s the best coffee in New York. FASHION STATEMENT A Sunday outfit for me is usually jeans, boots, a Capezio dancer’s ballet leotard and a really killer jacket. It’s all pretty casual underneath and then, boom! there’s this fabulous jacket. That’s my usual get-up: it’s kind of a cross between Auntie Mame and Lori Singer in “Footloose.” A GREAT EDIT I usually walk toward Greenwich Village, to look and putter around in Stella Dallas. These days a lot of vintage stores are basically just ’90s and ’80s stuff; this is really beautiful vintage without being too precious. There are a lot of great pieces from the ’50s and ’60s. It’s not designer vintage and it’s not trashy vintage: It’s just a great edit. CHECKMATE Then I’ll go to Chess Forum. I’ve been going there to talk to the guy who owns it, Imad Khachan. It’s a total institution; all the Washington Square Park guys go to Chess Forum. When I was working on my Lipstick Chess collection, I would go there to learn more about chess. They taught me about it and explained it to me. That’s the type of thing I do on a Sunday; if I’m working on a specific project, I go and find a store that’s really going to inspire me about the concept. BONE TO PICK From there I’ll go to Springbone Kitchen, which is where I get my bone broth, a.k.a. the elixir of youth. I either get the grass-fed beef broth or the ginger and turmeric beef broth — it’s all homemade and delicious. THE MEANING OF LIFE Sometimes I’ll be with a friend and sometimes I’ll go alone and read The New Yorker. I take The New Yorker with me pretty much everywhere I go — I stash a copy with me — because I have come to realize that the meaning of life is to try and read your new New Yorkers. Reading The New Yorker is just so stimulating: I get so many of my lipstick ideas from The New Yorker and NPR. MATINEE After that, at around 3 or 4, I’ll end up at the IFC Center or Film Forum or Angelika Film Center. I’ve got three of my favorite cinemas in that radius. I love a matinee. I have a few movie buddies that come with me, and then we’ll go to B&B Winepub on West Houston Street for French fries and a glass of white wine. It’s become a ritual. SUNDAY NIGHT FEVER Then I’ll go to Whole Foods and do some grocery shopping. It’s not very glamorous, but I make it glamorous because I go in my fabulous outfit and listen to full blown ’70s and ’80s disco music through my earbuds. It makes the experience quite surreal, because I’m sort of boogieing while I’m picking out sweet potatoes. It’s the only way that it makes it interesting for me. SETTLING IN On a Sunday night I will cook. it’s definitely not a going-out night for me. What I love to make is a big mixture of steamed root vegetables of all different colors and flavors with sautéed ratatouille with tomatoes and garlic in olive oil: I put that on top of the vegetables, and then I put a substantial dollop of hummus on top of that, and then fresh coriander, and then a poached egg. It’s scrumptious!",3.5
2016225,Louisiana Republican Wins Final U.S. Senate Seat in Runoff,"BATON ROUGE, La. — Bringing a wildly unpredictable election cycle to an unsurprising close, Louisiana voters on Saturday elected John Neely Kennedy, the state treasurer, to the Senate, giving Republicans a final 52-48 advantage over the Democrats. With roughly two-thirds of the precincts reporting, Mr. Kennedy had secured 64 percent of the vote and the seat vacated by Senator David Vitter, defeating Foster Campbell, a public service commissioner long known for his populism. Mr. Kennedy, with an anti-establishment, outsider message and a reputation as a fiscal hawk, secured a commanding position early in the race in Louisiana, which has not sent a Democrat to the Senate since 2008. “I’m humbled and honored by the overwhelming support from all over the state,” Mr. Kennedy said on Saturday. “Louisiana voters sent a clear message tonight and I’m ready to go to Washington, D.C., to fight for our people.” Mr. Campbell had received unwavering support from Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, but Mr. Kennedy benefited from high-profile visits by President-elect Donald J. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Mr. Trump won Louisiana by 20 points and his popularity outshone other names on the state’s nonpartisan primary ballot — he received 358,000 more votes than the combined total for Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Campbell. At a rally here on Friday for Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Trump said, “If he doesn’t win, I have myself a problem in Washington. It’s close.” He later added, “If John’s not there, maybe we can’t build the wall.” Democrats had hoped the Louisiana race would give them an opportunity to thin the Republican margin in the Senate. “We left no stone unturned,” Mr. Campbell said in his concession speech. “I make no excuses. We did everything humanly possible.” Some Democrats saw it as a last stand in a dismal year capped by Hillary Clinton’s defeat. Some celebrities, including the actor John Leguizamo and the comedian Patton Oswalt, took to Twitter and asked people to donate, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts made an appeal, as well. “Republicans here and around the nation couldn’t have had more of different outlook and reaction,” said Lionel Rainey III, Mr. Kennedy’s communications director. “This race was viewed as a final swing of the hammer into the coffin for Democrats seeking statewide office in Louisiana. It was a chance to send a message.” But the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee steered clear of the race. After Mr. Edwards’ surprise victory in the governor’s race last year over Mr. Vitter, Democratic leaders believed they could have replicated those 2015 successes had there been more outside help. Managing the runoff in classic front-runner fashion, Mr. Kennedy turned down debates and positioned himself as a stalwart conservative. Mr. Campbell attacked his opponent on his Democratic and pro-choice past, but Mr. Kennedy kept a lead in the polls. “I peg him as a thinker, somebody who will bring to the Senate a great deal of insight and a strong understanding of the nuances of Louisiana, a conservative who can continue the legacy of David Vitter,” said State Representative Paul Hollis, a Republican. The popularity of Mr. Trump’s brand of politics in the state also surfaced in the Third Congressional District, the Cajun heel of Louisiana’s boot that has produced some of the state’s most colorful and well-known populist politicians. Clay Higgins, a former police captain who gained fame online as the “Cajun John Wayne,” had claimed 56 percent of the vote there with nearly all of the precincts reporting, toppling Scott Angelle, a fellow Republican who was heavily favored to win.",4.5
2019163,"Butch Trucks, Drummer in the Allman Brothers Band, Dies at 69","Butch Trucks, a drummer who was one of the founding members of the seminal Southern rock group the Allman Brothers Band, died on Tuesday at his home in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 69. His booking agent, Page Stallings, confirmed the death but said he did not know the cause. Mr. Trucks was one of the band’s two original drummers; the other was Jai Johanny Johanson, known as Jaimoe. Mr. Trucks was considered to be the straightforward rhythm player, while Mr. Johanson added R&B and jazz influences. The Allman Brothers Band, led by the guitarist Duane Allman and the keyboardist and vocalist Gregg Allman, helped define Southern rock, a style that incorporated elements of blues, country and jazz as well as rock. The band was formed by the brothers, Mr. Trucks and Mr. Johanson, along with the guitarist Dickey Betts and the bassist Berry Oakley, in Jacksonville, Fla., in 1969. They moved to Macon, Ga., to cut their first album, released that year by Capricorn Records. Their breakthrough came in 1971 with the live album “At Fillmore East,” featuring an extended version of one of the band’s signature songs, “Whipping Post.” They cemented their status as one of the leading rock bands of the 1970s with the double album “Eat a Peach” in 1972 and the album “Brothers and Sisters” the next year. Both Duane Allman and Mr. Oakley died of injuries sustained in motorcycle accidents in Macon — Mr. Allman at 24 in 1971, shortly after the “Fillmore East” album was released, and Mr. Oakley, also at 24, in 1972. The band continued to record and tour before breaking up in the late 1970s. Over the last 30 years, the Allman Brothers Band reformed several times with various members. The band played a series of farewell concerts at the Beacon Theater in New York in 2014. “I’ve lost another brother, and it hurts beyond words,” Gregg Allman said in a statement on Wednesday. “Butch and I knew each other since we were teenagers, and we were bandmates for over 45 years.” The Allman Brothers Band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. Mr. Trucks’s nephew Derek Trucks leads the Tedeschi Trucks Band with the singer Susan Tedeschi and was a member of the Allman Brothers Band from 1999 to 2014. Another nephew, Duane Trucks, is the drummer for the band Widespread Panic. Mr. Trucks most recently toured with the band Butch Trucks and the Freight Train. Claude Hudson Trucks was born in Jacksonville on May 11, 1947. He started playing drums in the eighth grade and played in his high school band and two other bands before graduating. He also played timpani in the Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra and the Jacksonville Symphonette. At Florida State University, he formed a band called Bitter Ind. He met Gregg and Duane Allman when they saw his band perform at a club in Daytona Beach, Fla. Mr. Trucks is survived by his wife, four children and four grandchildren. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine last year, Mr. Trucks said the Allman Brothers Band had started out only wanting to play the music its members loved, never counting on stardom. “We were out spreading the gospel of this music we had discovered,” he said. “We never thought that we would be more than an opening act.”",3.5
2024024,Daily Report: Why Retail’s Future Is in Seattle,"Bits How do behemoth technology companies test out new concepts? If you are Amazon, you use your hometown as a living lab. That’s what Nick Wingfield, a tech reporter for The New York Times, found in Seattle, where Amazon was started and has its headquarters. In the past few years, the giant e-commerce company has tried out numerous retail experiments in Seattle, including a drive-up grocery store, a physical bookstore and a roaming delivery truck called the Treasure Truck. Amazon’s tests have cemented Seattle’s reputation as a hub for retail innovation, which in turn has spurred the creation of jobs and demand for office space in the city. In past years, REI, Costco and Nordstrom all got their start in Seattle. And Starbucks, which is also based in Seattle, has tried its own retail pilots in town, including opening its first high-end coffee bar, Roastery, there. If Amazon’s retail pilots in Seattle are successful, the company sometimes rolls out the concepts across other places in the United States. So if you want a peek into your retail future, Seattle is a great place to see what may unfold.",4.5
2025573,New York Today: A Groundhog Has Her Day,"New York Today Updated, 11:28 a.m. Good morning on this semi-sunny Thursday. “Punxsutawney Phil is the only true weather forecasting groundhog,” the rodent’s website says. “The others are just impostors.” Well, Pennsylvania: We, in New York, politely disagree. Our state is home to several reputable groundhogs (also called whistle pigs or woodchucks) — including Holtsville Hal, Malverne Mel and Dunkirk Dave — but first and foremost is the revered Staten Island Chuck. While Chuck may not have starred in a Bill Murray movie, New York’s official ambassador for this holiday was named the country’s No. 2 groundhog to watch by The Weather Channel. This morning at 7:30, Chuck did not see a shadow (as opposed to Punxsutawney Phil, who did) and determined the destiny of the winter we’ve hardly even had: Spring’s coming early. But Chuck boasts an 80 percent success rate, according to the Staten Island Zoo. Phil, by comparison, is right only 39 percent of the time. When we visited our groundhog this week at the Staten Island Zoo, we were pleased to learn that this Chuck (full name: Charles G. Hogg VII) is actually female. “Staten Island Chuck will always be Staten Island Chuck,” said Rebecca Orens, assistant manager of the children’s center at the zoo. “But through the years, things change.” The 4-year-old, 8.5-pound animal, which Ms. Orens described as “a curvy lady right now,” feeds on nutritious rodent pellets, roughage like kale, and sweet potatoes. Perhaps they serve something similar at your local lunch spot. And the groundhog is quite the social butterfly. In preparation for today, Ms. Chuck spent months training and socializing with zoo caretakers to ensure an elegant public appearance (free of any spats with the mayor, who skipped the event this year) and a confident, correct, shadow-or-no-shadow verdict. While Ms. Chuck didn’t do much public speaking this morning, “she does know how to high-five,” Ms. Orens said. “Which is really cute, but is also really good as a medical move because you can then clip her nails.” (She does not, however, take baths or get her teeth cleaned.) Here’s what else is happening: Shadow or not, city marmots will see relatively cheerful skies outside their burrows. The sun is creeping out from behind the clouds and should tug the mercury up to a high of 43. (Although wind gusts this afternoon could make it feel colder.)

2031974,Trump and the Battle Over Sanctuary in America,"Retro Report The concept of sanctuary cities is deeply embedded in Western tradition. In biblical times, shelter was offered even to those who might have qualified as “bad hombres” in the eyes of President Trump. Killers, for example. If the crime lacked intent, they could flee to havens specifically designated in Deuteronomy and the Book of Joshua. Skip ahead 3,500 years or so and societally sanctioned refuge is proving as powerful a concern for Americans today as it was for the ancients. Sanctuary cities — and counties and states — loom large as Mr. Trump seeks to vastly expand and speed the deportation of undocumented immigrants while threatening to withhold federal money from localities that refuse to cooperate with immigration officials. To switch the biblical reference point to Ecclesiastes, there is no new thing under the sun, certainly not in regard to sanctuary. Retro Report, video documentaries examining major news stories of the past and their continued relevance, begins a new series by recalling the so-called sanctuary movement of the 1980s, which put church and state in conflict with each other over the fate of Central Americans fleeing civil wars and pleading for asylum in the United States. Those refugees found President Ronald Reagan’s White House no more eager to open its arms than the Trump administration is now to embrace Syrians seeking shelter from carnage back home. The Reagan administration supported military governments in El Salvador and Guatemala, viewing them as bulwarks against pro-Communist insurgencies. And so it played down widespread human rights outrages by those regimes and affiliated death squads. When Salvadorans and Guatemalans tried to enter the United States, claiming a fear of persecution in their homelands, they typically were labeled “economic migrants,” not political refugees. Few were granted asylum — less than 3 percent in 1984. By comparison, Poles fleeing Communism were 10 times as likely that year to find asylum here. Anti-ayatollah Iranians were 20 times as likely. With the front door to the United States effectively shut, Central Americans turned to a back entrance. This was the sanctuary movement. In the 1980s, it came to be embraced by hundreds of churches and synagogues, as well as by some college campuses and cities, in more than 30 states. Refugees denied political asylum were spirited across the southern border and sheltered in houses of worship like Southside Presbyterian Church in Tucson. “These were middle-class folks who were fleeing for their lives,” the Rev. John M. Fife, Southside’s pastor in the 1980s, said of one group of asylum seekers. “We’d take in people who had torture marks all over their body, and the immigration judge would order them deported the next day,” said Mr. Fife, who is retired. When it came to smuggling and hiding people, he said, “I assumed it was illegal, but I could not claim to be a Christian and not be involved in trying to protect refugees’ lives.” In all, an estimated 2,000 refuge seekers were aided in that latter-day version of the Underground Railroad. Unavoidably, the clergy made itself a foe of the government, which argued that no one was above the law and that the sanctuary movement was, at heart, inspired more by politics than by theological imperatives. Movement members were put on trial. In one celebrated 1980s case, eight of them, including Mr. Fife, were convicted of felony conspiracy and other charges. None ended up going to jail, however. “Sometimes,” Mr. Fife said at the time, “you cannot love both God and the civil authority. Sometimes you have to make a choice.” The issue today for people who share his beliefs is not so much how to bring unauthorized immigrants into the United States as it is how to keep millions already here from being tossed out. Dozens of cities and many times that number of counties describe themselves as sanctuaries. What that means in practice can be elusive. In some places, the police are ordered not to inquire about immigration status when they take people into custody. Some cities openly refuse to cooperate with federal requests to hold undocumented immigrants until they can be deported. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, a Democrat, pledged cooperation if public safety was threatened, but “what we will not do,” he said, “is turn our N.Y.P.D. officers into immigration agents.” Other cities call themselves sanctuaries but have no clearly articulated policy. As far as Mr. Trump and many fellow Republicans are concerned, failing to deport unauthorized immigrants is to invite the “bad hombres” among them to commit crimes. In his address to Congress last week, the president singled out several murders ascribed to undocumented immigrants. Often cited by him is the 2015 murder of Kathryn Steinle, 32, who was shot as she strolled on a pier in San Francisco. The man charged with killing her was a Mexican laborer with a long criminal record who had been deported from the United States five times, yet somehow managed to keep coming back. To sanctuary defenders, evocations of a case like the Steinle murder amount to setting policy by anecdote. Studies show that crime rates among unauthorized immigrants are lower than those among native-born Americans. Moreover, some local officials say it is not their job to enforce federal law. Many of them argue that it is self-defeating for cities to make undocumented but otherwise law-abiding immigrants feel vulnerable and afraid of the authorities. “We have to have people that cooperate with their local police if we’re going to have any effect at all on the crime rate,” Sheriff John Urquhart of King County in Washington State told Retro Report. Early in the Obama presidency, the government took a hard line. Immigrants without proper papers faced deportation for all manner of infractions, criminal and noncriminal alike. Expulsions reached record highs, at one point surpassing 400,000 a year. But many Obama supporters felt that the policy was unduly harsh, and the administration came to agree. In its final years, it focused principally on people who were deemed threats to national security, were convicted of serious crimes or were recent border crossers. Even with those tighter standards, plenty of people were sent packing: more than 240,000 in 2016, according to the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Mexicans, Guatemalans, Hondurans and Salvadorans accounted for 94 percent of the total. Mr. Trump has proposed returning to a more aggressive approach: rounding up and expelling potentially millions of people, including those not convicted of serious wrongdoing or, for that matter, even charged with any crime at all other than being in the United States without legal blessing. But the president created some confusion about his intentions when he surprisingly suggested in a private meeting with television anchors last week that he was open to finding a way to let millions of the undocumented stay in the country legally. What he meant was hardly plain. Publicly, his hard line on illegal immigration remained intact. To carry out mass deportations, thousands of new immigration and customs agents would be hired, and local police officers and sheriff’s deputies would be recruited. To do that, the president would need the cooperation of state, county and city officials. What if he does not get it? Mr. Trump has said he is prepared to cut off federal funds to those localities. It is not a threat they can take lightly. New York City, for one, relies on aid from Washington for about 10 percent of its $85 billion annual budget. A sign of what could happen nationally emerged last month in Texas, where Gov. Greg Abbott canceled $1.5 million in criminal justice grants to Travis County, whose seat is Austin, the state capital. This was after the county sheriff renounced cooperation with immigration officials seeking deportations. How far Mr. Trump intends to take his threat is unclear. Will all federal aid to sanctuary cities be imperiled or just certain programs? No doubt, any cutoff of funds would invite court fights that could take many months, or even years, to settle. In the meantime, the sanctuary movement could still pack a punch. That was suggested by Elizabeth M. McCormick, who teaches immigration and asylum law at the University of Tulsa College of Law. “We’re at a moment in history right now,” she told Retro Report, “that may be similar to the 1980s, when individuals felt that they needed to stand up for what’s right.” OpinionShakeer Rahman and Robin Steinberg",3.5
2038466,Checking Democracy’s Pulse,"Civics Lessons American democracy remains healthy, but its health has worsened for the first time in recent history, according to a new survey of 1,126 political scientists. Three-quarters of respondents said the quality of United States democracy had declined in the last two years, after four decades of stability. Twenty-one percent said there had been no change, and 4 percent said it was healthier. The survey was the second by Bright Line Watch, a group formed by academics after the presidential election to study democratic performance in the United States over time. Compared with the first survey, conducted in February, a month into Donald J. Trump’s presidency, they said the country was doing worse on a few core democratic principles. Between February and May, there was a decrease in the share of respondents who thought the United States was meeting or fully meeting the standard that the Constitution and Congress could effectively limit executive power. They thought the country was not doing as well at giving citizens equal legal and political rights, or keeping elections free from foreign influence. Also, fewer thought the judicial branch was sufficiently independent, though more than half still said it was. Bright Line Watch, which includes professors from Dartmouth, Yale and the University of Rochester, conducted the survey by contacting 9,500 political science faculty members at the 511 institutions represented at the American Political Science Association, of which 1,126 responded. It is not a representative sample, and academics tend to be left-leaning, including some of the organizers of the survey who publicly criticized Mr. Trump during the campaign. It nonetheless provides perspective on the political moment from a large number of experts in political science and history. “The possibility for democratic backsliding is a real one, as history has shown,” said Peter D. Feaver, a political scientist at Duke who is a Republican but opposed Mr. Trump. “But we have not seen those worst fears on either side, either the Trump critics or the Trump supporters. I think that what we’ve seen instead is that the Madisonian system of checks and balances is operating.” The survey asked about the overall quality of American democracy in 1800, 1850, 1900, 1950, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005, 2015 and today. The political scientists reported the sharpest increase in improvement between 1950 and 1975, a period that included the civil rights movement and the Voting Rights Act. From 1975 to 2015, they said, the health of the democracy was pretty much stable. They said it was still healthier today than before that period, but that its quality had declined in the last two years. The survey organizers said it appeared that respondents were not rating this year lower because of their partisanship, because their ratings were stable for decades that spanned presidencies of different ideologies. Of course, perspective in hindsight is different than it is at the time things are happening. “The president is discovering what all of his predecessors have, which is that you may be the most powerful man in the world, but you’re not all-powerful,” said Mr. Feaver, who served on the National Security Council staff in the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. The United States performs best in allowing free speech (80 percent), the survey found, with an average of 72 percent of the respondents saying the country meets or mostly meets various standards like tolerating protests and protecting free expression. The quality of elections received a more mixed analysis. More than 80 percent of respondents, on average, said elections were conducted without fraud or restrictions on which parties could participate. But most said that there were problems with foreign influence in elections, and that campaign contributions influenced public policy too much. Ninety-three percent said the United States failed at the democratic principle that geographic boundaries of electoral districts should not systematically advantage any particular political party. Respondents also had mixed views on government accountability. An average of more than three-quarters thought the judicial branch effectively checked executive power. But they were less approving of other checks and balances. Less than half thought that Congress could effectively limit executive power or that law enforcement investigations of public officials were free from political influence. About three-quarters of respondents said the United States failed at principles of equality, like giving citizens equal voting, legal and political rights. The professors gave the worst grades to norms of civil discourse on both sides. Examples of civility would be when elected officials are decent to opponents, seek compromise with them or even share a common understanding of facts. About 90 percent of the respondents said the United States was failing to achieve or only partly achieving civility. But they expressed confidence that the American system of checks and balances could prevent breaches from causing too much damage, as evidenced by respondents’ reaction to the Justice Department’s appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate Russian influence in the election after Mr. Trump fired the F.B.I. director, James Comey. Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to break governmental norms, and many Trump voters sent him to Washington precisely to do so. Experts say that in weak democracies, norm violations can erode democracy — but that in strong ones, institutional checks and balances ensure that they don’t. Mr. Mueller’s appointment came during the response period for the survey. Of those who answered the survey before the appointment, only a third said that the United States was succeeding at making sure executive authority could not be expanded beyond constitutional limits, and that law enforcement investigations of public officials were free from political influence. But of those who answered it after Mr. Mueller’s appointment, nearly half said so. The change was statistically significant, and their answers were otherwise similar to those who completed the survey before.",4.0
2039349,"Gustave Newman, Defense Lawyer in Sensational Cases, Dies at 90","Gustave Newman, a goateed criminal defense lawyer in a host of headline-grabbing cases who genially cajoled skeptical juries and cowed hostile witnesses with his booming baritone, died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 90. His death was confirmed by his son, Eric. A lion of New York’s white-collar criminal defense bar, Mr. Newman achieved one of his greatest courtroom successes in 1993, when, after a contentious five-month trial, he managed to win the acquittal of Robert A. Altman, a Washington lawyer who, with Clark M. Clifford, a former defense secretary, had been accused in a scandal involving global money-laundering and illegal transfer of capital. The episode, involving the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, cost depositors an estimated $12 million. His legal strategies also led the federal government in 1991 to drop its fraud and embezzlement case against Representative Floyd H. Flake, a Queens Democrat. He persuaded a jury to acquit Dov Hikind, a Democratic state assemblyman from Brooklyn, on charges of taking illegal payoffs in 1998; and convinced another jury to acquit Judge Nora S. Anderson, of the Manhattan Surrogate’s Court, on charges of lying about contributions made to her campaign in 2010. Mr. Newman had a reputation for tackling the toughest cases. Accordingly, he lost some. Among his convicted clients were Bernard Bergman, who headed a nursing home empire and was found guilty in 1975 of filing more than $1 million in phony Medicaid claims; Anthony Anastasio, a dock union official, who was accused of taking kickbacks from a ship repair company; and Samuel D. Wright, a city councilman who, as the head of a Brooklyn community school board, had been charged with extorting $5,500 from a textbook supplier. (Mr. Wright claimed that the fee, which he had declared on his tax return, was an honorarium for a speech, although the main speaker at the same event, a United States senator, received only $2,500.) “Gus told me that he has won more than 30 percent of his criminal trials,” Robert Giuffra of the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell wrote last year on Law360.com. “That’s an incredibly impressive percentage — sort of like batting .350. In federal court, the U.S. attorney wins more than 90 percent of all cases.” Benjamin Brafman, who worked with Mr. Newman on a number of cases, said in a phone interview on Wednesday: “I know some very prominent criminal lawyers who have very good reputations who have never heard the words ‘not guilty’ in 20 years. That doesn’t mean that they’re not good criminal defense lawyers, but Gus had that extra ounce of perfection that caused him to win more than most. “He was eloquent, charming and extraordinarily well prepared,” Mr. Brafman continued, “and there was instant likability that caused jurors to take him very seriously. He was able to wrap his client in his own personal credibility.” Mr. Newman was so polished, another colleague, Ronald P. Fischetti, told The Washington Post in 1983 that “when you see Gus in a tuxedo, you have an irrepressible urge to put money in his hand and ask for a better table.” Gustave Harold Newman was born on Jan. 5, 1927, in Brooklyn, the son of Jacob Newman, a construction union organizer, and the former Ida Levine. He graduated from Samuel J. Tilden High School, served in the Army in the Pacific during and immediately after World War II, and earned a bachelor’s degree and a law degree from New York University. In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, the former Winnie Goldberg; a daughter, Debra Newman Solowey; and two grandsons. Mr. Newman’s scholarly courtroom demeanor and decades of trial experience (by one count, he tried some 400 cases) commanded respect from judges, juries and his peers. He could represent a congressman in one trial and an organized-crime figure in the next while maintaining his reputation for integrity. He was chosen as the first president of the New York Council of Defense Lawyers and was among a distinguished roster of white-collar defense lawyers to win that organization’s Norman S. Ostrow Award, which celebrates the defense of individual rights. The case against Mr. Flake was also a major victory for Mr. Newman. The judge tossed out most of the embezzlement counts, and the government moved to dismiss its own case just as it was about to call its final witness. In the widely publicized Altman case, the jury’s not-guilty verdict came after Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman, his law partner and protégé at the time, were indicted by the Manhattan district attorney’s office and the federal authorities on charges that they had secretly aided the Bank of Credit and Commerce International to take control of a Washington bank, First American Bankshares. B.C.C.I., an international bank run by Middle Eastern bankers, was shut down in 1991 on charges of fraud, laundering drug money and bribing banking regulators. Mr. Clifford, an adviser to four presidents and defense secretary under Lyndon B. Johnson, was not tried at the time because he was 86 and ailing. (He died in 1998 at 91.) Mr. Newman never called a single witness for the defense, but he skewered prosecution witnesses in cross-examination, theatrically accusing one banker of giving the grand jury an account of the case that flatly contradicted an earlier version in his own book. “He always said that the key to cross-examination is to test the logic of the witness’s story,” Mr. Giuffra said. In his summation, Mr. Newman said: “The prosecutors gave you a jigsaw puzzle with a load of pieces. As you’re working out the pieces, there are big gaps. These pieces are the wrong size and the wrong shape. The picture that they make is that Bob Altman is innocent of any charges in this case.” Others were eventually convicted, and millions of dollars were paid in restitution. Five years after Mr. Altman’s acquittal in 1993, he and Mr. Clifford reached a $5 million settlement with the Federal Reserve. They did not admit to any wrongdoing, but Mr. Altman agreed not to participate in the banking industry without the Federal Reserve’s approval.",5.0
2050207,"Meet Archie Warhol, the Art World’s Second-Most-Famous Dachshund","Show Us Your Wall CHADDS FORD, Pa. — “He’d come down here for the weekend, but I don’t think he was too crazy about the country,” the painter Jamie Wyeth recalled, wryly, of Andy Warhol’s visits to the bucolic southeastern Pennsylvania farm where Mr. Wyeth still lives. By the 1970s, when a joint show saw each man painting a portrait of the other, sparking one of the art world’s unlikeliest friendships, Warhol was famous for many things. Being a nature enthusiast was not one of them. Mr. Wyeth’s meadows and woods — the land that had inspired the artwork of both Jamie and his father, Andrew Wyeth, at whose side he painted through his teenage years — were little match for the pull of “General Hospital.” “Andy would spend most of his time down here watching soaps on TV, because he said the TV reception was better than in New York,” Mr. Wyeth added with a bemused shrug. The pair’s budding simpatico was eyebrow-raising for reasons beyond a lack of shared interests. Each had come to represent a warring camp within the art world: Mr. Wyeth was a proxy for, and inheritor of, his father’s status as the paragon of realist traditions, with their emphasis on technical skill and a reverence for the rural terra firma; Mr. Warhol was the standard-bearer of an urban demimonde, with an aversion to anything smacking of “flyover country.” A walk through the Museum of Modern Art shows the outcome of that ideological rivalry — Mr. Warhol’s work receives prime gallery placement, while Andrew Wyeth’s iconic “Christina’s World” is orphaned in a hallway by the escalators. In this centennial summer of Andrew Wyeth’s birth, with a slew of celebratory events including the Brandywine River Museum of Art’s retrospective featuring his rarely seen works, and the issuing of Wyeth-themed stamps by the United States Postal Service, Mr. Wyeth has returned to Warhol as a portrait subject, plumbing the person behind the persona. Mr. Wyeth relied on his detailed sketches from 1976 (“I even measured the length of his fingers”) for one of these new portraits — done on a screen door in a seeming nod to Mr. Warhol’s own conceptual playfulness — that now hangs in the Brandywine. A study for the same painting hangs in Mr. Wyeth’s living room, looking out at the surrounding sea of canvases by the extended Wyeth family. Unlike the finished version, however, this study shifts its focal point to Mr. Warhol’s beloved dachshund Archie, second only to Pablo Picasso’s Lump in modern art’s dachshund hall of fame. These are edited excerpts from our conversation. Why focus on Archie instead of Andy? Archie meant a huge amount to Andy. He carried that dog everywhere, even to Studio 54! So he became Andy personified, without the makeup and the wig. Did the two begin to act alike? Archie was a mirror of his boss. He’d sit there and stare at people. And just like Andy, he didn’t say a word. When Andy would be here, people would say, ‘I just had the most interesting conversation with your friend Warhol.’ And I know that his end of the conversation was three words: ‘Hello. Oh? Really?’ Given your differences, why did Warhol gravitate toward you? He wanted young people around. The theory people have is that’s why he let me work with him, and why he later had [Jean-Michel] Basquiat come around. That’s why the kids he worked with called him Drella — part Cinderella, part Dracula. He was getting much more out of you than you were getting out of him. So what did you get, as an artist? I was fascinated by this creature. Him posing for me and my being able to do all these drawings of him was enough. What did you think of the portrait Warhol painted of you? It made me look a bit too glamorous. But he told me that as a child his favorite toys were paper dolls. Well, if you look at his portraits, they’re all paper dolls. The eyes are cut out and everybody is made to look pretty. When he did Marilyn Monroe or Elizabeth Taylor, it was out of love for them. It wasn’t being cute or edgy. He wanted to keep reproducing them because he was enamored of them. It’s not the coolness of Koons. Warhol was a fan. A picture caption with an earlier version of this article carried an incomplete credit. The picture of the painter Jamie Wyeth, seen at his country home with his recent portrait of Andy Warhol, was taken by Tony Cenicola of The New York Times; in addition, the portrait seen in the picture is credited to 2017 Jamie Wyeth/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York.",3.5
2051359,Opinion | The Country I Love,"Op-Ed Contributor SEATTLE — Seventeen years ago, I celebrated my first Independence Day as a United States citizen. I couldn’t have predicted then that I would one day have the enormous privilege of being the first Indian-American woman to serve in the United States House of Representatives, and one of only six members of Congress who are naturalized citizens. After arriving here from India at age 16, I spent more than a dozen years on an alphabet soup of visas — F1, H1B and more — before I finally got my green card through marriage to an American. Some years later, I was awarded a fellowship from the Institute of Current World Affairs, which allowed me to spend two years living in my birth country. I just had to come back to the United States once a year to keep my permanent resident status current. When I became pregnant during the second year of the program, my husband and I planned to return to the United States in time for my last trimester, so I could deliver the baby at home, and then return to India. That plan did not work out. Just two weeks before we were scheduled to board our flight back to the United States, I developed a leak in my amniotic sac. My son was born prematurely at 26.5 weeks, weighing less than two pounds. I was now faced with a choice. In order to preserve my permanent resident status, I needed to return to the United States within weeks of his birth. But he was so tiny and in such critical condition that he could not fly, and I refused to leave his bedside knowing he might die. So I stayed in India. I lost my green card status and only through the help and hard work of the institute was I able to regain my permanent residence status and return to the United States three months later when my son was finally able to fly. I became determined to get my citizenship as soon as I was eligible so that I would never again face the prospect of being separated from my son, who was a United States citizen by virtue of being the child of a United States citizen father. Part of the agreement that had allowed me to return to the United States again and regain my permanent residence status was that I would have to start from zero to qualify for citizenship again. That process took three years. When I finally walked into the cavernous hall at the old location of Immigration and Naturalization Services (now called United States Citizenship and Immigration Services) south of downtown Seattle, I was prepared for a simple transaction that would finally grant me citizenship and ensure that I would always be with my son. I did not anticipate the emotion that would come with the moment, or the way it would shape my future, and my understanding of this country. There were hundreds of others at the ceremony from all over the world, and I could hear languages from every continent spoken. We all carried small American flags. Grandparents held children; moms and dads held hands. As we took the oath of citizenship, the solemnity of the moment spiked through me. Tears welled up and rolled down my cheeks as I took in the mixed emotions of renouncing any allegiance to my birth country of India where I had been a citizen for 35 years and embracing my new country. America, a country that had embraced me as a 16-year-old who had come here by myself to study and build a life of better opportunity. America, a country built on the idea of being a refuge for those in need, “the tired masses, yearning to breathe free.” America, a country that has always celebrated itself as a nation of immigrants. In that moment, as I took my oath, I realized how lucky I was. I knew that my future had opened up, and that citizenship would offer me the chance to seek opportunity and to take part in our democracy. I knew, too, that with those freedoms and opportunity came enormous responsibility: to do everything I could to preserve and build our democracy, to vote, and to use my life to pay it forward and ensure opportunity for others. I became an immigrant, civil and human rights advocate, then the first South Asian elected to the Washington State Legislature and the only woman of color in the Washington State Senate, and then was elected in 2016 to the United States Congress. These are difficult times for immigrants and for Americans across our country. President Trump has harnessed the fear and prejudice that have accompanied every wave of immigrants in United States history, and stoked those fears to further his own agenda. Restricting immigration from Muslim-majority countries, and cracking down on unauthorized immigration in a way that tears families apart and creates an atmosphere of fear, cuts at the very fabric of what really does make America great: the diversity that is our greatest strength. This Fourth of July, as I remember my own naturalization ceremony and give thanks for the honor of being a United States citizen and a member of Congress, I call on the president and my fellow Americans to remember our history. What makes America great is our commitment to our values of inclusivity and opportunity for all. Immigration is about more than just who comes here and who is allowed to stay. It is about who we are as a country and what we are willing to stand up for.",3.5
2052316,"‘I Did Not Collude,’ Kushner Says After Meeting Senate Investigators","WASHINGTON — President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, described himself to Senate investigators on Monday as a political and foreign policy neophyte who met with Russians as part of a hectic and unconventional presidential campaign, not as part of a plot to steer the election. “All of my actions were proper and occurred in the normal course of events of a very unique campaign,” Mr. Kushner told reporters on the White House grounds after two hours behind closed doors on Capitol Hill. “I did not collude with Russians, nor do I know of anyone in the campaign who did.” Hours before he traveled to Capitol Hill for his session with the investigators, Mr. Kushner, a senior White House adviser, released a lengthy written statement explaining the purpose of a number of contacts with Russians last year — meetings that have thrust him into the middle of a controversy that has engulfed the early months of the Trump administration. The decision to release the statement, and to appear voluntarily before Congress, is a clear strategy to try to navigate a political storm. His meetings with a Russian ambassador, lawyer and banker have prompted questions about his honesty, and calls from Democrats to deny him access to classified information. By being the first member of Mr. Trump’s campaign inner circle to speak to congressional investigators, he was able to shape the narrative with his version of a still murky chain of events. Jared Kushner’s representatives released on Monday morning prepared remarks for Senate investigators. In the statement, Mr. Kushner flatly denied participating in — or having any knowledge about — collusion with Russia. But Monday’s moves were not without legal risk. Though he was not under oath when he spoke to the Senate Intelligence Committee, lying to Congress is a federal crime. His public statement was frequently unequivocal, leaving him little room to maneuver if new evidence emerges to contradict his story. The Justice Department and congressional committees are investigating whether anyone around Mr. Trump conspired with the Russian government to disrupt last year’s election, and whether Mr. Trump tried to impede the investigation. During his public statement on Monday, Mr. Kushner said Mr. Trump won the election because he had a better message and ran a smarter campaign than Hillary Clinton, not because he had any help from Russia. “Suggesting otherwise ridicules those who voted for him,” Mr. Kushner said. He took no questions from reporters. Months of reports about repeated contacts last year between Mr. Trump’s advisers and Russians have buffeted Mr. Trump’s staff. Administration officials once flatly denied there had been any meetings with Russians during the campaign or transition, only to have journalists discover one meeting after another. This month, The New York Times reported that members of the senior campaign staff, including Mr. Kushner, met in June 2016 with a Russian lawyer on the explicit promise of receiving damaging information about Mrs. Clinton. An email to Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son and the person who set up the meeting, said the information was part of the Russian government’s campaign to support the elder Mr. Trump. Mr. Kushner said he was unaware of the promise of damaging information because he did not read the email chain forwarded to him by Donald Trump Jr., titled “Re: Russia - Clinton - private and confidential.” He said he arrived at the meeting late and left early, after emailing his assistant asking for an excuse to escape. That account steers questions about the meeting squarely to Donald J. Trump Jr. and Paul J. Manafort, the former campaign chairman who also attended the June 2016 meeting. Both men are in discussions with Congress about when they will appear before investigators. During his meeting with congressional staff members, Mr. Kushner acknowledged that after the November election, he sought a direct line of communication to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. He characterized that action as a routine part of his job in establishing foreign contacts for Mr. Trump’s transition team. “The fact that I was asking about ways to start a dialogue after Election Day should of course be viewed as strong evidence that I was not aware of one that existed before Election Day,” Mr. Kushner said. Mr. Kushner said he met the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, in December, along with Michael T. Flynn, a retired general who would become Mr. Trump’s national security adviser. Mr. Kushner said that he expressed hope during the meeting that the new administration would have an improved relationship with Moscow, and that he had asked Mr. Kislyak whom he should talk to who was in direct contact with Mr. Putin. Mr. Kislyak said “generals” in Russia had important information to share about Syria, Mr. Kushner recalled. The United States and Russia are the dominant proxy powers in Syria’s civil war. Several are under scrutiny by the F.B.I. and Congress. “He asked if there was a secure line in the transition office to conduct a conversation,” Mr. Kushner said. “General Flynn or I explained that there were no such lines. I believed developing a thoughtful approach on Syria was a very high priority given the ongoing humanitarian crisis, and I asked if they had an existing communications channel at his embassy we could use.” That request, first reported by The Washington Post and since confirmed by former senior American officials, generated suspicion that Mr. Kushner was trying to avoid American surveillance. Mr. Kushner denied that. “I did not suggest a secret back channel,” he said. When Mr. Kislyak rejected the idea of using the Russian Embassy, Mr. Kushner said, they dropped the discussion. Days later, Mr. Kushner met with Sergey N. Gorkov, the head of Vnesheconombank, a bank under American sanctions. Mr. Kushner said that Mr. Kislyak had described Mr. Gorkov as someone “with a direct line to the Russian president who could give insight into how Putin was viewing the new administration and best ways to work together.” While meetings with foreign diplomats are common during presidential transition, the Gorkov meeting was unusual because his bank is under sanctions by the American government and has ties to Russian intelligence. Aides to Mr. Kushner have said that, in the frenzy of transition and after an election that Mr. Trump’s team did not expect to win, Mr. Kushner’s meetings were not vetted ahead of time as they would have been during a typical transition. Mr. Gorkov gave Mr. Kushner a piece of art and a bag of dirt from his family’s ancestral village in Belarus. “He said that he was friendly with President Putin, expressed disappointment with U.S.-Russia relations under President Obama and hopes for a better relationship in the future,” Mr. Kushner said. He said that he had regarded it as a campaign meeting and that business deals were not discussed. And Mr. Kushner said he had disclosed the gifts to the transition office — a sign, he said, that the meeting was no secret. Mr. Kushner said he did not discuss specific policies, including American sanctions against Russia, with either Mr. Kislyak or with Mr. Gorkov. Mr. Kushner’s meetings attracted special attention because he did not initially disclose them on federal forms required for his security clearance. Mr. Kushner said that his staff had inadvertently filed an incomplete form, leaving off all foreign contacts — not just Russian ones — as well as other information. By making his prepared remarks public, Mr. Kushner ensured that his version of events would be seen in full. He is scheduled to speak on Tuesday with House investigators, again in private. Several White House aides have expressed concern about appearing before Congress behind closed doors. Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign aide who spoke to the House Intelligence Committee in a closed session on July 14, has urged officials to release a transcript of his appearance after a Democratic congresswoman who did not attend the hearing told CNN that Mr. Caputo may have “lied” to the committee. “I’m warning anybody who would listen against doing a closed hearing in the future,” Mr. Caputo said in an interview. Roger Stone, one of Mr. Trump’s longest-serving advisers, was scheduled to appear at a closed session this week, but it was postponed. Mr. Stone said he wanted to make an immediate release of the transcript of the session a condition of his appearance. “It’s not an unreasonable request,” Mr. Stone said. “Everybody in this lineup should be concerned.” Opinion",3.0
2053133,California Today: A Candidate for Governor Looks to the Central Valley,"California Today Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The path to the governorship of California winds through the Central Valley. That, at least, is the idea animating the candidacy of Antonio R. Villaraigosa, a former two-term mayor of Los Angeles and speaker of the State Assembly. While California is a blue state, candidates in the 2018 governor’s race won’t be able to rely on Democratic votes alone. Among registered voters, roughly 45 percent are Democrats, and 26 percent Republican. Mr. Villaraigosa, 64, was raised by a single mother in a poor neighborhood on Los Angeles’s Eastside. In speeches and interviews, he has portrayed himself as a potential champion of California’s interior, where he spent time during an extended “listening tour” that began in 2015. Along the way, he’s taken shots at his better-funded rival, Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor and former San Francisco mayor, whose candidacy has been a favorite of voters in the Bay Area. We caught up with Mr. Villaraigosa by phone. Some excerpts: Q. How do you differ from the other Democratic candidates? A. I’ve been talking about the need to focus on an economy that’s working for more people and building more middle-class jobs. We need to restore the luster of the California dream and make sure that that dream is for everyone, not based on your ZIP code or what part of the state you live in. What have you been hearing from people in the Central Valley? I think there is a sense that they want to be included in the California rebound that they hear politicians talk about in Sacramento virtually daily. When you hear people say “We’re creating more jobs,” what they don’t say is that, while that’s true, most of that has been in the Bay Area and along the coast. I think we should all be concerned that Marin County has among the nation’s highest rankings for well-being and 100 miles away in the Central Valley, they have among the lowest. What’s your pitch to the Bay Area? The pitch to the Bay Area and to the affluent parts of Los Angeles or San Diego or any place on the coast is that we won’t survive and thrive if we’re not growing together. A high-wage worker puts more money into our Social Security system. A high-wage worker is buying more goods. A high-wage worker is less dependent on the public health system. How do you assess Eric Garcetti’s tenure as mayor of Los Angeles? Oh, I’m not running against Garcetti. You’re the former mayor, you must ... I take a page out of Bush’s playbook, where he didn’t comment about Obama, and Obama doesn’t comment for the most part about Trump — you would think he’d comment a lot more given what Trump does — but you know Garcetti is a very popular mayor in this town.

[LA Weekly] Mark Twain once called it “the fairest picture the whole earth affords.” Lake Tahoe, straddling the Nevada-California border in the Sierra Nevada, is famous for its crystal blue water. In the 1960s, it was so pristine visitors could peer more than 100 feet into the water. Since then the visual clarity has declined to an annual average of roughly 70 to 75 feet, said Geoffrey Schladow, director of the Tahoe Environmental Research Center at U.C. Davis. Among the culprits clouding the water are urban runoff and the growth of algae linked to climate change. In recent years, the lake’s surface temperature has been warming faster than ever. On Tuesday, all four United States senators from California and Nevada, among other leaders, gathered for the 21st annual Lake Tahoe Summit, an environmental conference. The group reaffirmed a commitment to restoring the lake with the help of $415 million in federal money set aside for environmental projects in the Tahoe Basin. That’s on top of more than $2 billion already spent since the yearly conferences began in 1997. Dr. Schladow acknowledged that some might question such spending on a lake that is doing better, environmentally speaking, than many others. “But it’s an iconic lake,” he added. “And we think we can bring it back to what it was.” California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

2055408,"Review: In ‘Viceroy’s House,’ the Birthing Pains of Two Nations","Cramming ample history into a compact running time without sacrificing flow or interest, “Viceroy’s House” is a handsome, fleet look at the months leading up to India’s independence from Britain in 1947, a milestone that just passed its 70th anniversary. The film carries a trace of the sweep of a great screen epic along with the straightforward, explanatory qualities of mass-audience TV, and is never less than absorbing. Smoothly interweaving the perspectives of British rulers at the viceroy’s house in Delhi and those of their Indian staff, it offers a surprisingly sympathetic portrait of the motives of Lord Mountbatten (Hugh Bonneville), Britain’s last viceroy to colonial India, who oversaw the transfer of power. That process is still hotly debated: The partition of India, which created an independent India and Pakistan, led to the displacement of more than 10 million people and mass carnage in the resulting violence. Gurinder Chadha, the British-raised director of “Bend It Like Beckham,” closes the film with an ode to her grandmother, who sought refuge from Pakistan in India. As its personal entry point, the film offers a love story between Jeet (Manish Dayal), a Hindu who works as one of Mountbatten’s servants, and Aalia (Huma Qureshi), a Muslim who is betrothed to someone else and may end up on the opposite side of a new border. Famous figures — including Mohandas K. Gandhi (Neeraj Kabi), Jawaharlal Nehru (Tanveer Ghani) and Muhammad Ali Jinnah (Denzil Smith) — are supporting but pivotal players. Impeccable production design and some fine performances, including Gillian Anderson’s as Mountbatten’s wife, hold this film together.",4.0
2057542,"At U.N. General Assembly, Signing a Nuclear Pact and Debating Another","Live Briefing Nuclear weapons were the focus as global leaders addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, a day after President Trump vowed to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatened the United States or its allies. Leaders from around the globe began adding their signatures to a treaty that bans nuclear weapons, although the world’s nine nuclear-armed countries declined to sign it and denounced it as dangerously naïve. President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, responding to Mr. Trump’s denunciation of the Iran nuclear deal as “an embarrassment,” defended the agreement in his own remarks to the General Assembly on Wednesday. Mr. Rouhani said the agreement could be “a new model for global interactions.” • Sign up for the Morning Briefing for United Nations news and a regular look at what you need to know to begin your day. Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s top foreign official, who led a 90-minute meeting on Wednesday of the parties that negotiated the Iran nuclear agreement, said bluntly afterward that everyone in the room, including the United States, had agreed that Iran was complying with its obligations. She warned of the risks of reopening negotiations, as some Trump administration officials have suggested. She did not answer a question about whether the United States was committed to staying in the accord. “The international community cannot afford dismantling an agreement that is working and delivering,” she told reporters outside the United Nations Security Council chamber. Referring to North Korea’s nuclear program, Ms. Mogherini also said: “We already have one potential nuclear crisis. We definitely don’t need to go into a second one. This is an agreement that prevented a nuclear program and potentially prevented military intervention. Lets not forget that.” “There is no need to renegotiate parts of the agreement because the agreement is working,” she added. She spoke after the foreign ministers of six countries — Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States — had met along with their Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif. Ms. Mogherini insisted that the European Union would ensure that the accord stayed in place. “As Europeans, we will make sure the agreement stays.” Asked whether the Trump administration would quit the agreement, Ms. Mogherini said the accord belonged to no single country. “It’s not for one party or the other to certify this,” she said, noting that only the International Atomic Energy Agency had that responsibility. “There are other issues that are out of the scope of the agreement and issues might be tackled in different formats, different fora.” Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson represented the United States; Nikki R. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, was also in the room. She left without taking questions. — SOMINI SENGUPTA Daniel Ortega, the president of Nicaragua, has announced that his country would sign the Paris Agreement on climate change, a decision that will leave the United States and Syria as the only nations not part of the global accord. The move came as the Trump administration has been sending mixed signals about whether it will abandon or remain in the pact of nearly 200 nations to curb greenhouse gases. It also comes as other leaders attending the United Nations General Assembly this week pledged to support the climate change goals. Nicaragua initially objected to the Paris agreement because, its negotiators said, it did not compel rich countries to do enough to cut carbon emissions or to pay for the damages caused by climate change. But in an announcement first reported by El Nuevo Diario, a Nicaraguan newspaper, on Monday, Mr. Ortega reversed course, saying he would sign the accord to help protect the most vulnerable countries. “We have to be in solidarity with this large number of countries that are the first victims, who are already the victims and are the ones who will continue to suffer the impact of these disasters and which are countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, of the Caribbean, which are in highly vulnerable areas,” he said according to a translation of his statement. — LISA FRIEDMAN Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan staunchly defended the Trump administration on North Korea during his address to the United Nations, saying that now was not the time for dialogue. “We consistently support the stance of the United States that all options are on the table” to stop North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, Mr. Abe said. For North Korea, he said, “dialogue was the best means of deceiving us and buying time.” In the past month, North Korea has twice fired missile tests over Japan. The Japanese have limited missile defenses, and the country’s position to the east of North Korea means that missiles fired by Pyongyang toward the United States, including Guam, almost certainly would have to fly over Japanese territory. “Again and again, attempts to resolve the issue through dialogue have all come to nought,” Mr. Abe said. He called North Korea’s leader, Kim Jung-un, “a dictator” and said that “sooner or later” Mr. Kim would be able to deliver an intercontinental ballistic missile. “North Korea is attempting to dismiss with a smirk efforts towards disarmament we have assiduously undertaken over the years,” Mr. Abe said. “The nonproliferation regime is about to suffer a serious blow from its most confident disrupter ever.” — SOMINI SENGUPTA Speaking to the General Assembly on Wednesday, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran praised the nuclear deal with his country as a “model” and slammed President Trump. Pledging that Iran would not be the first to “violate” the nuclear deal, Mr. Rouhani made a sideswipe at President Trump, saying, “It will be a great pity if this agreement were to be destroyed by rogue newcomers to the world of politics.” He argued that the Middle East was safer because of the pact, and said the harsh rhetoric from the Trump administration “undermines international confidence in negotiating with it.” “Imagine for a moment how the Middle East would have looked had the J.C.P.O.A. not been concluded.” Mr. Rouhani said, using an acronym for the pact. He also singled out “baseless” allegations made on Tuesday at the General Assembly, without naming anyone. The nuclear deal, Mr. Rouhani said, has been widely applauded and endorsed by the Security Council. “As such it belongs to the international community in its entirety and not only to one or two countries,” he said, adding that the agreement “can be a new model for global interactions.” A tweet sent from Mr. Rouhani’s official account also took aim at Trump’s speech. He also said that American taxpayers should ask why billions of dollars spent in the region had not advanced peace but has only brought “war, misery, poverty” and a “rise of extremism.” Mr. Rouhani followed his United Nations speech about an hour later with an hourlong news conference, in which he denounced what he called Mr. Trump’s “completely baseless allegations” about Iran, demanded an apology and said the Iran nuclear agreement was final and could not be amended, reopened or renegotiated. — SOMINI SENGUPTA and RICK GLADSTONE Leaders and diplomats from dozens of countries signed a treaty at the United Nations on Wednesday that will outlaw nuclear weapons — a document that disarmament advocates described as a historic first. The world’s nine nuclear-armed countries, including the United States and North Korea, declined to sign the treaty, and the Americans and their allies denounced it as dangerously naïve. The treaty, finalized in July by negotiators representing 120 of the 193 United Nations members, offered a stark contrast to the threats of mutual nuclear annihilation raised in the bombastic exchanges between North Korea’s regime and the Trump administration in recent weeks. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, as it is officially known, will enter into legal force 90 days after being ratified by 50 countries. “The treaty is an important step toward the universally held goal of a world free of nuclear weapons,” Secretary General António Guterres, who supported the negotiations, said at the ceremony held in the Trusteeship Council chamber. President Michel Temer of Brazil was the first to formally sign the treaty, as other leaders and diplomats in the chamber applauded. The United States and the other nuclear-armed states urged other countries not to sign it. The Americans in particular ridiculed it, arguing that North Korea and any other rogue entity with nuclear weapons would ignore its provisions. In a statement issued before the signing ceremony, NATO denounced the treaty, saying it “disregards the realities of the increasingly challenging security environment.” Supporters of the treaty said they had no expectation that nuclear-armed states would accept it at first. But they said they hoped that it would eventually increase the stigma of possessing such weapons because of their destructive power. “This treaty is a clear indication that the majority of the world no longer accepts nuclear weapons and do not consider them legitimate weapons, creating the foundation of a new norm,” the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons said in a statement. The treaty would outlaw the use, threat of use, testing, development, production, possession, transfer and stationing in a different country of nuclear weapons. — RICK GLADSTONE President Trump is devoting his third day of international diplomacy in New York to a series of individual meetings with foreign leaders on Wednesday, mainly from the Arab world, as he seeks to rally a coalition in the Middle East against Iran. He started on Wednesday morning by getting together with King Abdullah II of Jordan, who has met with Mr. Trump several times already, including an encounter shortly after the inauguration when the king attended a Washington prayer breakfast to lobby the president not to move the United States embassy to Jerusalem. The two expressed friendship on Wednesday. Mr. Trump praised the king for hosting so many Syrian refugees in his country and for combating terrorism. “He’s a very fine gentleman, a very nice man,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the start of the meeting. “He’s also a great, great fighter.” The king expressed solidarity. “We’re all fighting together,” he said, adding that terrorism “is a scourge” around the world. “Jordan will always stand beside you and your country.” Mr. Trump will meet later in the day with Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt. He also will host a luncheon with African leaders. – PETER BAKER President Trump on Wednesday reaffirmed his commitment to brokering peace between Israelis and Palestinians despite widespread doubts, pledging to devote “everything within my heart” to succeed where presidents have failed for generations. “I think we have a pretty good shot, maybe the best shot ever,” Mr. Trump said as he met with Mr. Abbas at a New York hotel. Mr. Trump acknowledged that it was a “complex subject” and “the toughest deal of all,” but vowed to invest his political energy to making it happen. “I will do everything within my heart and within my soul to get that deal made,” he said. The Palestinians have expressed skepticism about Mr. Trump’s initiative, raising the prospect that they would give up on the effort. But seated beside Mr. Trump on Wednesday, Mr. Abbas said he appreciated “the seriousness of your excellency, Mr. President, to achieve the deal of the century.” “This gives us the assurance and the confidence that we are on the verge of real peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis,” Mr. Abbas said. — PETER BAKER Mr. Abbas, in his General Assembly address, accused Israel of feeding “religious animosity” by imposing restrictions on Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem and undermining prospects for a Palestinian state. He also vaguely warned of consequences. If a two-state solution is replaced with one state occupying another, he said, “neither you nor we will have any other choice but to continue the struggle.” “This is not a threat,” he added, “but a warning of the realities before us as a result of ongoing Israeli policies that are gravely undermining the two-state solution.” Mr. Abbas spoke to the General Assembly shortly after his meeting with President Trump, whom he praised for emphasizing peace in the Middle East. The Palestinian leader alluded to that meeting only briefly in his speech, thanking Mr. Trump for his efforts to work out a peace deal. The Trump administration has not yet put up any specific proposal. Mr. Abbas’s speech came after an important deal reached with his Palestinian rivals, Hamas. They announced over the weekend that they would hand him the keys to governing the Gaza Strip and disband a shadow government that was set up earlier this year. He saved his ire for Israel. “Don’t ever try to go to a religious war,” Mr. Abbas said. “It’s really dangerous for you and for us. Our conflict is political.” It was an apparent reference to the crisis over the contested Al Aqsa Mosque compound, which is revered by both Jews and Muslims. Mr. Abbas warned vaguely that the Israeli authorities would have to take responsibility for governing Palestinian territories — a prospect that Israel eschews. “We cannot remain an Authority without any authority,” he said. “If they don’t want a two-state solution and if they don’t want peace, let them bear the responsibility.” President Trump’s threat to destroy North Korea provoked a debate among scholars of international law about whether he had violated a tenet of the United Nations Charter. Article 2(4) of the Charter says that countries should “refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force” against another country, and grants exceptions only for instances sanctioned by the Security Council or acts of self-defense. In this case, there was no authorization from the Security Council, so the question is: Was Mr. Trump justified on the basis of self-defense? John B. Bellinger III, who served as a legal adviser in the administration of George W. Bush, said that despite his “colorful” choice of words, Mr. Trump was on solid ground, invoking the self-defense argument. “His threat to destroy North Korea did not violate the U.N. Charter because he said that the United States would use force only ‘if the United States is forced to defend itself or its allies,’ ” Mr. Bellinger said by email. “The Charter specifically allows a U.N. member to use force in self-defense.” Kevin Jon Heller, a law professor at the University of London, said he believed that Mr. Trump had overstepped. “The problem is that self-defense must always be proportionate to the armed attack, and Trump clearly threatened disproportionate force,” Mr. Heller argued. “Had he said a nuclear attack would require wiping North Korea off the face of the earth, that might have been a lawful threat. But he did not qualify the threat in any way; on the contrary, he suggested North Korea would have to be destroyed in response to any armed attack on the U.S. or its allies. That is an unlawful threat that violates Art. 2(4).” — SOMINI SENGUPTA",3.0
2058530,Hating ‘Mother!’: Readers Speak Out,"It may not have attracted mass audiences, but “Mother!,” Darren Aronofsky’s allegorical thriller, did succeed in getting a lot of people talking — even if they hadn’t seen the movie. “Mother!,” which stars Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem, is meant to be a parable about climate change and environmental destruction, as Mr. Aronofsky and Ms. Lawrence revealed in a recent New York Times article. Critics were divided — A.O. Scott called it “a hoot” — but on nytimes.com and on our Facebook page, most moviegoers weren’t persuaded. Here is a selection of their comments, edited for length and clarity. Susan Andersen Dumbest movie ever. Jamie Elizabeth This movie gave me a stomachache. Richard Nielsen Seems like false advertising to call this a horror film. The horror is realizing I paid money to watch it. Heather Bocanegra I love love love these two actors, but it was horrible. Scott Thomas The hate the average viewer has for this movie just makes me want to see it more. Bridget Manter The biggest problem with this movie is that it will take somebody with half a brain to understand it, and that’s far too much to ask of the American public. Elizabeth Renant Aronofsky’s problem is an inability to tell the difference between style and substance. “Black Swan” had the same problem: in the theater I saw it, people were laughing at the end. Shock for its own sake isn’t quality. Howard Weiner This amazingly powerful and beautiful (yes) film is nothing if not original. Shocked by the film? Get over it. “Mother!” has done what the writer-director set out to do: Provoke intelligent conversation after experiencing a film like you’ve never seen before. Kas So this movie is about: 1) a middle-aged guy married to a woman 20 years his junior; 2) unspeakable violence done to a woman. Sounds original! Seriously, I think the most shocking thing about this is the idea that a couple can survive and own a home based on a poet’s salary. Larry Hedrick Of course I was put off by the extremely violent, disgustingly orgiastic, and grotesquely barbaric nature of some of Aronofsky’s scenes; so was everyone else. And yet there is more disturbing moving imagery of actual events in the recent human past on YouTube than the auteur has on offer here. Dan Poulson I was never bored; piecing together the various symbols and clues became a treasure hunt. My only complaint is that the film is structured as a kind of stations of the cross for the Jennifer Lawrence character, which necessarily means that she lacks any kind of real agency. She spends the entirety of the film in a state of traumatized bewilderment. Rob DePiazza I dug the movie for its outlandishness and agree with A.O. Scott about its comedic attributes, but I could barely tolerate the weakness of Lawrence’s character. Joe Zamarelli It’s funny to me the reviews that are so focused on the allegory aspect. My experience watching was so much more about the relationship, what she was dealing with, and the themes of vampiric/selfish art, creation and celebrity. Sarah Anne Rhodes Truly hated this movie. The allegory was not lost on me, nor was the intentional absurdity of the plot. Aronofsky’s point was made about an hour into the film, but he proceeded to beat a dead horse for the remaining hour. David Hartman “Mother!” has beautiful cinematography and may pretend to intellectual high-minded allegory, but in reality the repetitive theme of creation and destruction plays out more like “Groundhog Day” in hell than a biblical allegory. If Tom Six (director of “Centipede”) used Bergman’s cinematographer to film a script by Rob Zombie, you’d have this movie. Joshua Trimble It’s been a long time since I overheard Ma and Pa Kettle talking about a film on the way out of the theater. Art above all else should be misunderstood loudly. Thomas Bracken Here’s a free clue. Watching your movie should explain the movie. Sharon Sheppard It has been a long time since a movie affected me in such deep and weird ways and left me thinking about it for days afterward. There were so many ideas going on my head felt it would explode, but in a good way. “Mother!” is not for those seeking escapist entertainment, but I would urge people to watch it and spend time arguing about it afterward. David Michael Miller I saw it with my cousin and have since spent more time talking about it than we spent watching it. Not many movies can dig that deeply into my brain. If you think it’s easy, you go get a camera and do it. Lynn I sat in the movie and asked myself, how does Darren Aronofsky know exactly how it feels to be married to my husband? video",3.0
2063741,Iowa Withdraws Request to Leave Obamacare Market,"WASHINGTON — With just over a week until the Affordable Care Act’s enrollment season begins, Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa said Monday that she had withdrawn the state’s request to opt out of the law’s insurance marketplace next year by offering customers a single plan with lower premiums and a high deductible. The waiver request had been closely watched by health policy experts as the most far-reaching effort by a state to sidestep requirements of Obamacare. Governor Reynolds, a Republican, said the Trump administration had tried hard to approve it, but had found it impossible to do so without violating the terms of the law. “Unfortunately, it now appears Obamacare’s waiver rules are as inflexible as the law itself,” Ms. Reynolds said at a news conference in Des Moines. “I’m extremely disappointed.” Iowa wanted to create a state-run system for 2018 that its insurance commissioner said would lower premiums for most of the 72,000 residents of the state who currently have Obamacare health plans, including 28,000 who earn too much to get subsidies to help with the cost. High premiums have frustrated many customers, especially those who receive no subsidies. But these cheaper premiums would have come with a trade-off: higher out-of-pocket costs. The plan available would have been one with deductibles of $7,350 for a single person and $14,700 for a family. The proposal would also have reallocated federal dollars that lower costs for people with modest incomes, using the money to help even the wealthiest customers pay their premiums. Critics said approving the Iowa waiver would have paved the way for other states to follow, eroding the health law’s protections for low- and middle-income Americans. Some had planned on filing a legal challenge if the Trump administration had said yes to the request, known as a “state innovation waiver.” “This is a case of the law’s guardrails protecting people and their coverage,” said Sarah Lueck, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning group that had opposed the waiver. “Hopefully now Iowa can start looking at more practical and less disruptive solutions to deal with the challenges in its market.” The Washington Post reported recently that President Trump in August had asked Seema Verma, the federal official in charge of reviewing Iowa’s plan, to reject it. Some supporters of the law saw that as a deliberate effort to keep premiums high; Mr. Trump frequently cites sharply rising premiums as proof that the health law is failing. But Ms. Reynolds said the Trump administration had worked with Iowa “to the greatest extent possible” to get the waiver approved. The health law allows such waivers only if a state proves the alternative coverage will be as comprehensive and affordable, covers a comparable number of people and does not increase the federal deficit. Last week, the administration informed the state that its plan would likely increase the federal deficit, but that it would take several weeks to figure out by how much. That, Ms. Reynolds said, prompted her to withdraw the request. In a joint statement with Ms. Reynolds, Ms. Verma echoed Mr. Trump’s contempt for the 2010 law, calling it “unaffordable, unsustainable and unworkable.” The individual insurance market is particularly fragile in Iowa, partly because the state has allowed tens of thousands of healthy people to keep old plans that do not comply with the health law. Aetna and Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield, the state’s most popular insurer, are both withdrawing at the end of the year. The only insurer remaining in Iowa’s Affordable Care Act marketplace for next year, Medica, is seeking premium increases that average 56 percent, blaming Mr. Trump’s decision to stop paying subsidies known as cost-sharing reductions that lower many people’s deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. Most Iowa customers will not feel the increase, however, because they qualify for premium subsidies that will rise to cover it. But state officials have predicted that most of the 28,000 people who receive no subsidies will cancel their coverage. So far, the Trump administration has granted state innovation waivers to three states, Alaska, Minnesota, and Oregon; they will use federal money to help insurers cover the claims of their most expensive customers next year, with the intent of lowering premiums. Oklahoma abruptly withdrew a similar request last month — one that state officials said would have reduced premiums by an average of 30 percent — saying that the Trump administration had been too slow to approve it. The administration on Monday also deemed a similar waiver request from Massachusetts incomplete and said there would not be enough time for the state to put in place a so-called reinsurance program for 2018.",4.5

2068088,Governors Awards Omit Mention (Onstage) of Sex Harassment Scandals,"LOS ANGELES — The show apparently goes on. On Saturday night, as chauffeured S.U.V.’s carrying the likes of Jennifer Lawrence and Steven Spielberg inched through gridlock traffic en route to the Governors Awards, the first major stop on Hollywood’s long march to the Oscars, a question hung in the air: How would attendees handle self-celebration at a time when sexual harassment scandals are engulfing the entertainment industry? On the presenter list were some of Hollywood’s most outspoken women, including Angelina Jolie, Ava DuVernay and Jessica Chastain. Would the tone be less gleeful than usual? Perhaps the Piper-Heidsieck Brut Champagne would flow a little less freely? The outcome was perhaps summed up best by a moment during the cocktail hour, when a waiter arrived with a tray of hors d’oeuvres. “Deviled eggs for everyone!” he cheerfully pronounced. Indeed, the topic of sexual harassment went unmentioned during the formal ceremony, which lasted more than three hours and covered honorary Oscars for the cinematographer Owen Roizman, the actor Donald Sutherland and three directors — Agnès Varda, Charles Burnett and Alejandro G. Iñárritu. The closest anyone came to the elephant in the room was Ms. Jolie, who introduced Ms. Varda, the filmmaker credited with inspiring the French new wave movement with her 1956 film, “La Pointe Courte.” “We need to draw strength from artists like Agnès,” Ms. Jolie said from the stage. “Those women who went first, who took that first step, showed the way for all of us.” Then Ms. Jolie and the mischievous Ms. Varda did a little dance. It seemed during a few moments as if the Governors Awards were taking place in a parallel dimension where the torrent of sexual harassment allegations against male stars, producers and directors did not exist. Dustin Hoffman, for instance, strode onstage and was greeted with enthusiastic applause. In recent weeks, Mr. Hoffman was accused of sexual harassment by two women. He issued an apology on Nov. 1. Mr. Hoffman was on hand to present an honorary Oscar to Mr. Roizman, whose credits include “The French Connection” and “The Exorcist.” Mr. Hoffman, who worked with him on “Tootsie,” praised Mr. Roizman’s “integrity as a craftsman and as a person.” Despite efforts by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to keep the focus of the evening on honorees, the crowd privately chatted almost nonstop about the allegations that — in the span of roughly a month — have toppled Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Brett Ratner, Roy Price, James Toback and Louis C.K. Over and over, people grimly speculated about who might be next. At least until the lobster mini-taco tray came around.",3.5
2068548,"Jean-Claude Van Damme Plays Jean-Claude Van Damme, for Kicks","In the new Amazon show “Jean-Claude Van Johnson,” the seemingly washed-up Muscles from Brussels gleefully sends up his action star image. In the new Amazon show “Jean-Claude Van Johnson,” the action star Jean-Claude Van Damme gleefully sends up his image as the washed-up Muscles from Brussels.CreditCreditGraham Walzer for The New York Times SIMI VALLEY, Calif. — On a recent afternoon on his expansive estate here, in a beautifully appointed living room the size of a mead hall, Jean-Claude Van Damme suddenly fired a high kick at my face, stopping short of crunching cartilage and bone. I didn’t ask him to do it, but it was a thrill nonetheless. After all, he’s aimed that very same foot at the heads of action superstars like Dolph Lundgren, Bolo Yeung and Sylvester Stallone. “I still love martial arts,” he said, breaking into a broad smile. “Martial arts changed my life. If you were born in the dojo, you will die in the dojo.” It’s hard to picture Mr. Van Damme, famed for his devastating reverse roundhouse and epic splits, not kicking somebody. Even in his lousiest pictures — “I made lots of low-budget movies,” he admitted — he’s a thing of beauty, a graceful, whirling dynamo. He’s Jean-Claude Van Damme, the Muscles from Brussels, in every movie he makes. So it’s perhaps not such a surprise that, in his latest project, he’s playing himself, sort of. On Dec. 15, Amazon Studios will release the first season of “Jean-Claude Van Johnson.” In the meta-series, part comedy, part drama, he plays a broken-down action star who makes terrible films — like a kung-fu-filled remake of “Huckleberry Finn” — as cover for his real gig as a lethal black-ops agent, code named Jean-Claude Van Johnson. The series may be his weirdest project to date, no small feat for a guy who, in a career spanning four decades, has punched a rattlesnake (“Hard Target”), been crucified by pirates (“Cyborg”) and saved a baby from a wild tiger with the help of the former N.B.A. star Dennis Rodman (“Double Team”). In “Jean-Claude Van Johnson,” his first television drama series, the 57-year-old actor tackles no fewer than three roles. He plays a fictionalized version of himself, a time-traveling doppelgänger and a simpering, squeaky-voiced Bulgarian factory worker. It’s a remarkable turnaround for this Belgian-born actor, who became a bankable action star in the 1980s and ’90s in films directed by some of Hong Kong’s greatest action directors, then watched as personal troubles — an addiction to cocaine, contentious divorces — scuttled his career. Rather than dodge the actor’s sometimes rocky past, the series lovingly mocks it. Throughout the six-part series, references are sprinkled to Van Damme films and life stories from the past, including parodies of training sequences and nods to his years filming in places like Bulgaria and China. Dave Callaham, the creator and showrunner, and a longtime aficionado of Mr. Van Damme’s work, leapt when he heard, in 2014, that Scott Free Productions, Ridley Scott’s company behind TV shows like “The Good Wife” and “The Man in the High Castle” (and films like “Blade Runner 2049,” “Murder on the Orient Express” and “The Martian”), was trying to come up with a TV series for the action star. A writer on “Godzilla” and “The Expendables,” Mr. Callaham knew action, but he had more than just another Van Damme martial arts flick in mind. He envisioned something high-concept, like the critically acclaimed 2008 Belgian film “JCVD,” which starred Mr. Van Damme playing himself as an unwitting participant in a post office robbery. “I told them I’d like to play with the notions of who he is and what he represents in the culture,” Mr. Callaham said. “He was my favorite actor growing up, so I wanted to talk about the ups and downs of his career, and to do something that involved all those different worlds. And they said, great, we don’t know what you’re talking about.” But Mr. Callaham was very apprehensive about how Mr. Van Damme would react when he pitched the show. “I didn’t know J.C. personally, and I didn’t know what his appetite would be for making fun of himself,” he said. “A lot of those guys, those ’80s guys especially, are not open to that.” And the treatment he created for Scott Free was, as he recalled, “insane.” (It opened with Mr. Van Damme as a forgotten sad sack who played Frisbee golf to stay in shape.) Without Mr. Callaham’s knowledge, the folks at Scott Free sent the treatment to Mr. Van Damme, who loved it. A meeting was set up, but Mr. Callaham was still nervous about meeting his lifelong hero. As a self-described “tiny kid” growing up in the ’80s, during the era of Arnold and Hulk Hogan, Mr. Callaham had idolized the smaller, speedier action star, and now he was finally going to meet him. “I had a panic attack,” he recalled. “I locked myself in the bathroom at Scott Free and refused to come out.” He needn’t have worried. “J.C. was really friendly and nice,” he said. “He was aware of my credits, so he mainly wanted to ask me questions about ‘Godzilla.’ He had a lot of questions about ‘Godzilla.’” With the new show, Mr. Van Damme, a native French speaker, has no problem mocking his image. Dressed in a black “Brussels, Belgium” T-shirt and jeans, he spoke candidly about his early days in Hollywood trying to convince casting agents that he spoke English (“it was a catastrophe”) and about past roles. “I made 40-plus movies where you see me with a gun and that one neutral face,” he said. The series riffs on themes from those films, including time travel (the 1994 cult classic “Timecop”) and doppelgängers (“Double Impact,” from 1991), and spoofs the “anything for a buck” nature of Hollywood action films. In “Huck,” the show’s film within a film, the hero is a brawling superpatriot in a straw hat (“I pledge allegiance to kicking ass,” he says), Tom Sawyer is a woman (and Huck’s lover), and Huck’s runaway slave pal is changed from African-American to Chinese mid-production, in a shameless scheme to exploit the Asian market. The series also shows the softer side of Mr. Van Damme, who, in the film (and, one could argue, in life) is often his own worst enemy. “I feel like he’s on this real razor’s edge between wanting to be very big and outgoing, and wanting to really keep to himself and be very private,” said Kat Foster (“Weeds”), who plays his black ops sidekick and ex-girlfriend. “I think ‘J.C.V.J.’ is a homage to the quieter parts of him, the parts of him that he prefers to hide.” As he awaits the international reaction to the show (which is set to air in more than 200 countries and territories), Mr. Van Damme is keeping busy on a variety of projects. He’s helping train mixed martial arts fighters (in the past, he’s worked with the Diaz Brothers and UFC champion Georges St-Pierre) and working to create a sanctuary for endangered animals in Australia. But he’s most excited about the series, which he calls the highlight of his year, and which will have its world premiere on Dec. 12 at the Grand Rex theater in Paris. “When I lost my ‘Timecop’ fame because of some stupidity, and then I didn’t do any theatrical film for nine, 10 years except ‘Expendables 2,’ I said to my mother, before you go, mama, I’m gonna make sure I’m back in theaters, and we’ll have a big premiere in Paris,” he said. “And now it’s happening. She’s 83, and everything I told my mama is happening now.”",2.5
2071583,Opinion | Al Franken and a National Reckoning,"Letters To the Editor: Re “Senator Al Franken Resigning Amid Sexual Harassment Allegations” (nytimes.com, Dec. 7): What I find truly disturbing and outright appalling about the calls that resulted in Senator Al Franken’s decision to resign is what this says about our standards for honesty and accountability, as well as the failing status of our political system. Notwithstanding the fact that, arguably, his behavior may be categorically different than that of Donald Trump and Roy Moore, in essence Mr. Franken is being punished for, in the view of some, admitting what he did and demonstrating remorse and accountability for inappropriate actions. In stark contrast, Mr. Trump and Mr. Moore are being rewarded for very likely lying, denying and, worse yet, viciously attacking their accusers, most of whom are widely seen as credible. This is a sad commentary on the state of our political system and a stain on our moral code. In his resignation speech Mr. Franken clearly captured the problem, citing the “irony in the fact that I am leaving, while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party.” RICHARD CHERWITZ, AUSTIN, TEX. To the Editor: Men who harass and abuse women should be publicly shamed and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. I do not think, however, that accusations alone should be enough to force a public official out of office. I understand that for too long people in power have looked the other way, and women have felt powerless and at the mercy of abusive men. Thank God it appears this has changed. However, I fear that in some cases the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction. Is an accusation now considered to be proof of wrongdoing? If so, it’s going to be pretty easy for political opponents to drive every Democrat out of office. Democrats said it was untenable for Al Franken to remain in the Senate if their party hoped to maintain the high ground on the issue of sexual harassment. So faced with a trade-off between an effective and electable progressive legislator versus the symbolism of taking the high ground, the Democrats in the Senate have chosen to throw Mr. Franken under the bus. If he did what his accusers say he did, he should suffer some consequences, but in this case the punishment seems out of proportion to the accusations. CARL SCHROEDEROLYMPIA, WASH. To the Editor: Re “WNYC Suspends Two Veteran Hosts After Accusations of Misconduct” (news article, Dec. 7): I am outraged about WNYC’s suspensions of Leonard Lopate and Jonathan Schwartz. Mr. Lopate was escorted out of WNYC without even being told the details of the charges so he can defend himself. I take sexual harassment very seriously, having been a victim myself, but I believe in due process, and I also believe that the punishment or remedy must fit the crime or incident. In many of the cases so far, incidents of various seriousness seem to lead to immediate dismissal, which I have found disturbing. But the suspension of Mr. Lopate for no explicitly given reason and before any type of investigation is done is the most egregious so far. Once again the left is eating its own, while the right tends to deny serious and credible allegations. Leonard Lopate has shown dignity, intelligence and wit on public radio for more than 30 years. He does not deserve this Stalinist treatment! CHERYL GUTTMAN, NEW YORK To the Editor: Re “City Ballet Investigates Its Leader Over Letter” (news article, Dec. 5): Ballet is not a “fuzzy area” when it comes to sexual abuse. Peter Martins’s artistic genius does not elevate him above the law; inappropriate, nonconsensual touching is abuse regardless of the industry. The same holds true for sexual harassment, which has little to do with “touching one another through choreography and instruction.” In fact, arguably, the standard should be higher — not lower — in a field that employs so many young people and manifests such a stark power differential.

2075917,"Andy Dalton Saved the Bills, and Fans Flocked to His Charity","Andy Dalton, the quarterback for the Cincinnati Bengals, is an unlikely hero for Buffalo Bills fans. But Dalton’s improbable last-minute touchdown pass against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday cleared the path for Buffalo’s first playoff appearance since the 1999 season, and grateful Bills fans responded by channeling their excitement into charity. Dalton said that by Wednesday evening, 10,000 people had donated almost $250,000 to his foundation since the game, enough to cover most of the charity’s goals for all of 2018. Many of the Bills fans donated $17 as a tribute to breaking their 17-year postseason drought. The Andy & Jordan Dalton Foundation, named for the Bengals quarterback and his wife, provides money and experiences for seriously ill children and their families in Cincinnati and Fort Worth, Tex. Before the Bills fans’ support, the foundation aimed to give six families each month grants averaging $2,000, for an annual budget of about $144,000. The money helps with medical bills and needed supplies. But after exceeding the entire year’s fund-raising goals in just two days, the foundation will be able to increase the number of grants it gives or to fund other programs, said Andrea Baker, a spokeswoman. The organization typically receives more applications for help than it’s able to provide, she said. “This money is going to allow us to not worry about accepting those extra applications each month,” she said. The donations began soon after the Bengals game ended, and word spread rapidly through social media. “What better way to say thank you than to donate 17 dollars, for 17 years, to help out his foundation,” said Norman Stoerr, a 62-year-old Bills fan who was born and raised in Buffalo. “This is beyond football,” said Peter Bellas, 56, a Bills fan in Miami who said he donated $49 in honor of the 49-yard touchdown. “The world doesn’t come to an end if the Buffalo Bills win or lose, but people’s lives are positively impacted by this in a way that’s rather meaningful.” Bills fans aren’t quite sure what to do with their happiness, a relatively unfamiliar feeling for them. Often considered among the most tortured fan bases in the N.F.L., they may wish to skip the next paragraph. They’d probably rather not be reminded of the 17 years of near misses and futility, including the failures to find a consistent quarterback or head coach. The team’s last playoff appearance, in 2000, ended in an improbable last-second loss on a play that became known as the Music City Miracle. And even their best run, in which they lost four straight Super Bowls in the ’90s, is best known for an infamous missed field goal. Going into Sunday, the Bills were considered a long shot to make the playoffs. After beating Miami, they still needed the Bengals, who went into their game with a 6-9 record, to take down the Ravens. Hope was all but gone for Bills fans as Dalton faced a fourth-and-12 with 52 seconds remaining, trailing by 27-24. But he lofted a pass downfield to Tyler Boyd, who broke a tackle on his way to a 49-yard touchdown. Having a history of disappointments made the success all the sweeter. The unlikely chain of events had Bills fans feeling downright gleeful, as seen in videos of reactions to Dalton’s touchdown toss. The Bills and the Ravens both finished 9-7, but the Bills got the final wild card position on tiebreakers. They’ll play the Jacksonville Jaguars in the wild-card round on Sunday. Dalton, who has a 4-1 record in games against the Bills, including a 20-16 victory this year, thanked Buffalo fans in a video on Tuesday. “We are blown away by everybody that’s donating,” he said. “Thank you to all the Bills fans, thank you for anybody that’s just supporting our foundation. Let’s keep it going.”",3.0
2077061,How Big a Deal Is a New Congressional Map for Pennsylvania?,"Although Democrats will probably pick up a few additional seats in this year’s election, the development is less helpful for them than it might at first appear. The Republicans are counting on a favorable congressional map to help their majority ride out a possible “wave” election this November. But the congressional map got a little less favorable on Monday when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the state’s Republican-drawn congressional map. If the ruling holds — and it is expected to, because it’s based on state law, not federal — this will be the fourth Republican gerrymander to be eroded by the courts since the 2014 midterm elections. It will probably cost the Republicans at least one seat in this year’s midterms, while eroding their position in several others. Pennsylvania has one of the harshest gerrymanders in the country. Republicans have held a 13-to-5 majority in the state’s congressional delegation since the map took effect in 2012, even though the state is traditionally competitive in state and federal elections. It’s impossible to predict exactly what the new map will look like. The court ordered the Republican-controlled state legislature to produce a new map by Feb. 9. Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, will have a veto, and if a new map isn’t approved by Feb. 15, the court will probably redraw the map itself. Neither outcome will necessarily yield an incumbent-blind nonpartisan map, like the kind that would be drawn by a commission in California or Arizona. Even so, there are already some things that seem likely: Mr. Meehan’s district, the Seventh, is routinely listed as one of the most severely gerrymandered in the country. It is likely to turn into a strongly Democratic district anchored in Delaware County. After the recent revelation that Mr. Meehan used taxpayer money to pay a sexual harassment settlement, Republicans would seem to have less incentive to take steps to give him even an outside chance at re-election. The open 15th District, vacated by the retiring Charlie Dent, could easily move to the left. Democrats already have a good chance to win the district, and they might even be considered favorites on a new map. But the Lehigh Valley will be a battleground district no matter how the map is drawn. An exercise in ruthless gerrymandering in a state already known for it. Either the 16th or the Sixth District, which both stretch from Philadelphia’s western suburbs to the countryside, would probably drift somewhat to the left but would remain competitive. Whichever district does not drift left might even move to the right, making it hard for the Democrats to gain another advantage. The Eighth District could move slightly to the left if it takes in more of northeast Philadelphia, but the effect wouldn’t be very large. Other districts might move to within striking distance for Democrats — like the open 11th District or Mike Kelly’s Third District — but Republicans would still be considered favorites. It’s easy to say that the new map will lead Democrats to pick up two to four seats. But there’s a catch: In this political environment, they were probably already going to win some of those seats anyway. Just take the district the Democrats were likeliest to pick up: the Seventh. Mr. Meehan was already in a competitive race. The district voted for Hillary Clinton, despite all the weird line drawing. And Mr. Meehan looks even more vulnerable after the news about sexual harassment settlement payouts. So could a new map cost Republicans the Seventh District? Probably. But if Democrats already had a good shot, the change is less valuable than it would have been in 2016, when Mr. Meehan won easily in a more favorable political environment. Over all, six Republican-held seats in the state are currently rated as competitive by the Cook Political Report. We’ll never know how many of those the Democrats would have gained on the current congressional map, but one could argue that the Republicans were already on track to lose two seats. If that’s true, it won’t be quite fair to attribute all Democratic gains to a new map. That’s most likely if the Republican state legislature succeeds in drawing a map that Governor Wolf can accept. They’ll probably take subtle steps to protect their incumbents. It’s easy to imagine, for instance, that the Eighth District — held by the Republican Brian Fitzpatrick — won’t add a chunk of northeast Philadelphia, as many potential nonpartisan maps have suggested. Republican features might remain, even if the court redraws the map. Gerrymandering is a big problem for Democrats in Pennsylvania but not their only one. Geography creates a disadvantage, too. The main challenge for Democrats is that they waste a lot of votes in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, where Mrs. Clinton won by a combined margin of 81 percent to 16 percent. Those lopsided tallies nearly let Mrs. Clinton win statewide, but don’t yield any additional congressional districts over a more modest 65-to-35-point margin. To my knowledge, the only plausible nine-nine map in the 2016 presidential election would involve splitting Pittsburgh into two districts — something that would run afoul of most nonpartisan redistricting criteria, including keeping municipalities intact and preserving communities of interest. A map with 10 Trump districts and 8 Clinton districts is easier to imagine, especially if the Democratic-led court redraws the map. Such a map would make the Democrats clear favorites to win the 15th District. But the most straightforward maps probably involve 11 districts that voted for Mr. Trump, even though he won by less than one point statewide.",3.0
2077391,Jamaica Has Never Had Olympic Synchronized Swimmers. These Girls Want to Change That.,"Meet Ajoni, Katana, Joydayne, Laila, and Nyouka: the band of athletes that makes up the Island Aquatics Synchro Club. Joydayne Whyte, 9, swimming during training at the National Stadium pool in Kingston, Jamaica.CreditCreditMalin Fezehai/The New York Times PORT ANTONIO, Jamaica — Port Antonio is known for its water. It is home to the Blue Lagoon, a placid pool fed by the Caribbean Sea that is surrounded by waterfalls, a lush green jungle and a string of idyllic beachside resorts. All that water is a natural training camp for the band of girls who have their hearts set on an unusual dream for this island nation: to someday compete as synchronized swimmers in the Olympics. The sport has never quite taken root here. Though the specialty has been an Olympic event for more than 30 years, it is far less established than other water sports, like diving and swimming, which have been around since the early 1900s. For a small country, Jamaica has won an impressive 78 Olympic medals, but there has never been a Jamaican synchronized swimming team in the Olympics. And for a country surrounded by water, it has never won an Olympic medal for an aquatic sport. But that isn’t going to discourage the magnitude of these girls’ dreams. Those dreams have formed around Olga Novokshchenova, a Russian two-time Olympic gold medalist in synchronized swimming, who began teaching out of her home in Port Antonio. She started with one student, the daughter of a friend. “That poor girl, she was actually dreaming to do springboard diving, but we didn’t have that, so I said, ‘Well you are going to have to do synchronized swimming,’” she said. Novokshchenova now coaches five athletes at her house: Ajoni Llewellyn, 17; Katana Blount, 10; Joydayne Whyte, 9; Laila Bailey, 12; and Nyouka Baugh, 15. They train four days a week and call themselves the Island Aquatics Synchro Club. It is not surprising that at practices there is a sense of sisterhood. Theirs is the only club for synchronized swimming that remains in Jamaica. (There was one in Kingston, but it disbanded.) For more Surfacing pieces, click here. One of the swimmers, Joydayne Whyte, remembers the moment she decided that she wanted to be an Olympic athlete. She was 3 years old. She was sitting in her home in Port Antonio, mesmerized as she watched synchronized swim teams competing in the Olympics as they twirled, bobbed and danced in brightly colored swimsuits and glistening makeup. “I want to do that!” she exclaimed to her mother, Andrea Rodgers. Rodgers herself had not learned how to swim. But she wanted to fulfill her daughter’s every wish. So she sought out a teacher. “It is my dream to continue swimming, to win and go to the Olympics and come first,” said Joydayne, a fourth grader, who has been Novokshchenova’s student now for two years. Last year, she qualified for the national team in synchronized swimming and represented Jamaica at the Central American and Caribbean Championships. Novokshchenova estimated that she has taught about 100 swimming students over the 12 years she has lived in Port Antonio. She would pick out the strongest swimmers of those she was teaching and ask if they were interested in synchronized swimming. Slowly, she started building a team. Katana was one of Novokshchenova’s beginner swimming students, and her father encouraged her to join the synchronized swimming team. “He is always smiling and taking pictures,” she said, adding that swimming on the team makes her feel special. She has even taught several of her family members how to swim at the beach. Jacqueline Neil, the mother of one of the swimmers, is known as “team mom,” and she arranged an overnight camping trip and a workshop at which a doctor talked about their health and periods. On a recent day in Port Antonio, the five atheletes arrived at Novokshchenova’s pool, still dressed in their school uniforms. They changed into their swimsuits and began to stretch. Training begins at 3 p.m. Ajoni made her way into the pool. She floated, slowly submerging her head in the water. “One, two, three, four ... ,” said Novokshchenova as a timer ticked. Ajoni gracefully tilted vertically until just her perfectly arched feet pointed above water. “Nineteen,” her coach shouted as Ajoni came up gasping for air. The team swims for three hours until about 6 p.m., when the sun sets, so the younger girls can get home before it gets too dark. Novokshchenova would like to be able to train them somewhere more central and accessible, but there are no public pools in Port Antonio. The expense of traveling to and from Novokshchenova’s house is quite an investment for the athletes’ families. The swimmers take taxis both ways four days a week, and that cost is an obstacle when recruiting new team members. The coach said that she had four other girls who wanted to join the team but that their families could not afford the taxi fare. Attracting and sustaining new members is one of the biggest obstacles of trying to reach their Olympic dreams. The athletes had their hearts set on qualifying for the duets category for the 2020 Summer Olympics. But they needed at least two swimmers in the same age range. Nyouka and her partner were training, but her partner moved abroad. At one point, they had 14 swimmers on the team, but now there are only five. It has been a challenge to keep the team motivated when there are so few people doing synchronized swimming in Jamaica. Ajoni said that none of her other friends at school knew how to swim. “My dream is to make synchronized swimming more known in Jamaica,” said Nyouka, who has been swimming for seven years. Her mother encourages her to continue training, reminding her what she would be doing if she weren’t swimming: “Nothing,” Nyouka said, laughing. The club is self-funded, and the swimmers’ parents pay about $100 every three months, not including international traveling costs, tournament fees, training expenses and competition swimsuits. The club relies on private donations and organizes fund-raisers to pay for the team’s overseas trips and expenses. In 2013, the team competed for the first time at a major event, the UANA Pan American Synchronized Swimming Championships. The team did not, however, have beginner’s luck. They finished “dead last,” said Jacqueline Neil, the team’s manager and Ajoni’s mother. “But the exposure was great. The girls had a whale of a time, and despite everything, they were the stars,” she said. “There were very few black teams.” “I hated the water. It was really cold,” said Nyouka of the event, her first competition. She said that it was scary because it was her first time performing before so many people. Two years later, the team placed fourth in the same competition, making it the highest place Jamaica has ranked. “We actually made history because it was the first time coming so close up in that kind of a competition,” Nyouka said. “It felt good.” Last year, the team traveled to Orlando, Fla., to compete in a junior Olympic championship. They placed highly in many of the categories. Laila and Joydayne won first place in the duets category; Laila got second place and Joydayne got fourth place in the 12-and-under category; Nyouka came in third place in the solo category and second in duets in the 13-15 age group; and Ajoni placed fourth in juniors. Laila had injured her leg just before the competition. “I had to bear the pain because I don’t like losing,” she said. She feels that her swimming performances help with her stage fright and that they will aid her in her professional life when she has to speak publicly. “Maybe I’ll get a job that I will have to make a speech or when I am graduating from high school and I have to make a speech, I’ll be more brave,” she said, adding, “I want to be someone that everyone else will be watching someday.” On a recent sunny day in January, Ajoni was celebrating her 17th birthday. As her present, she wanted to go to the beach with her teammates. She dreams of one day being an Olympian. But she also hopes to become a marine biologist and doesn’t think that she can continue training if she goes to college after graduating from high school. They all gathered at Frenchman’s Cove, a serene small beach where a natural river meets the Caribbean Sea with pristine clear waters. As they were about to enter the river side of the beach, a lifeguard approached them, warning of a strong current. Laila replied, “We swim for Jamaica.” And they ran into the water.",4.0
2083891,"Xi Jinping Extends Power, and China Braces for a New Cold War","BEIJING — Having cast aside presidential term limits, China is bracing for relations with the United States to enter a dangerous period under the continuing leadership of President Xi Jinping, intending to stand firm against President Trump and against policies it sees as attempts to contain its rise, according to Chinese analysts. Even before the announcement on Sunday that he could rule for the foreseeable future, Mr. Xi had ordered the Chinese military to counter the Pentagon with its own modernization in air, sea, space and cyber weapons, the analysts said, partly in response to Mr. Trump’s plans to revitalize American nuclear forces. Rather than beginning a final term next month as a lame duck, Mr. Xi will govern with new authority to pursue his agenda of making China a global power even if it risks putting Beijing in conflict with Washington and triggering a new Cold War after 40 years of mutual engagement, the analysts said. “In the Asia-Pacific, the dominant role of the United States in a political and military sense will have to be readjusted,” said Cui Liru, former president of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, a think tank under the Ministry of State Security that often reflects official thinking. “It doesn’t mean U.S. interests must be sacrificed. But if the U.S. insists on a dominant role forever, that’s a problem.” Asked if conflict was likely in the region, Mr. Cui said: “I don’t exclude that possibility. In this transitional period, it depends on how the two sides handle it.” He added that it was “not normal for China to be under U.S. dominance forever. You can’t justify dominance forever.” Mr. Xi appears to share the view of many Chinese analysts and military officials that the United States is a superpower in decline — and that China must step into the vacuum it leaves behind. He has accelerated the military’s plans to build a blue-water navy, increased spending on weaponry in outer space, and established China’s first military bases abroad. He has promoted a global infrastructure program to extend Beijing’s influence and ignored Western concerns about human rights, which have diminished under the Trump administration. The move in Beijing to scrap constitutional limits on presidential terms comes as former officials in Washington have expressed growing remorse about the longstanding bipartisan push for trade with China — which they now worry has allowed Beijing to prosper at America’s expense. Mr. Xi’s emergence as a strongman has driven home the disappointment among American policymakers that China has not become more open and democratic as it has become more wealthy. At the same time, Beijing has rejected pleas for fairer terms of trade, angering both Democrats and Republicans. President Trump himself has veered between sharp criticism of China on trade and lavish praise of Mr. Xi. He congratulated Mr. Xi on his “extraordinary elevation” at a leadership congress in October and likened him to a “king.” Mr. Xi’s attitude toward China’s place in the world was echoed Tuesday in the state-run newspaper, Global Times, which proclaimed in an editorial that “the country must seize the day, must seize the hour.” “Our country must not be disturbed by the outside world or lose our confidence as the West grows increasingly vigilant toward China,” it said. In some respects, Mr. Xi’s move to extend his rule in tandem with his drive to make China a dominant global power should not have surprised the United States, Chinese analysts said. “It is now clear Xi’s agenda to rebuild an Asian order with China at its center is here to stay,” said Hugh White, a scholar and former defense official in Australia who has argued that the United States must be prepared to share power with China in the Asia-Pacific region. “I think Xi is impatient,” Mr. White added. “He wants China to be the predominant power in the Western Pacific. He wants to do it himself and for it to go down in history as his achievement. That makes him formidable.” At the same time, analysts said, Mr. Trump has shown little interest in global institutions and ripped up an ambitious trade pact that included more than a dozen Asia-Pacific nations as one of his first acts in office. “Xi is exploiting the space that America voluntarily abandoned,” said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University. In contrast, he said, “China speaks again and again of globalization as a good thing.” Most worrying for the United States, analysts said, was the strategic competition emerging in Asia, where China is seeking to challenge American military dominance that has been the status quo since World War II. “China’s military objective is to break through the first chain of islands,” said Mr. Cui, referring to the waters beyond Japan and Taiwan where the Chinese military wants to establish a presence. Chinese military experts have also emphasized the importance of dominating nuclear, space and cyber technologies, said Phillip C. Saunders, a China expert at the National Defense University in Washington. Their views mirror those of American strategists who also see these fields as critical to success in modern war, he said. The Trump administration announced this month a new nuclear policy calling for revitalization of the nation’s nuclear arsenal to counter Russia and to a lesser degree China — an approach that has upset Beijing. “Trump is obsessed with strategic forces,” Mr. Shi said. “He is determined to maintain American military predominance in face of China’s strategic buildup. That will make the relationship more profoundly confrontational.” The United States has also tried to build a stronger “Indo-Pacific” coalition with Australia, India and Japan as a counterweight to China’s rise. The four democracies would increase military cooperation and invest in infrastructure to compete with Chinese projects in the region. But Chinese analysts said that Beijing did not believe the effort would amount to much because the United States was unwilling to spend money on the projects. “In the short term,” Mr. Shi said, “China does not care about it because the ability to form a real coalition is limited.”",3.5
2086329,"Opinion | Macron-Trump, a Friendship That Must Deliver","Roger Cohen PARIS — It is tempting to say that the relationship between President Emmanuel Macron of France and President Trump is the unlikeliest of friendships, but that would be to miss the point. Sure, they agree on very little. Not on Iran. Not on trade. Not on the European Union. Not on climate. Not on whether to criticize Vladimir Putin. Not on the importance of dignity, or truth, or the Enlightenment. Still, I hear that they speak all the time. Trump follows Macron’s labor-market reforms and calls to congratulate him. The first state visit of his administration will be Macron’s to Washington next month, a special honor for “a great guy.” The French president is Trump’s best friend in Europe, and possibly beyond. Things fizzled with Theresa May, the British prime minister. They never went anywhere with Germany’s Angela Merkel. Trump-Macron is the only trans-Atlantic hinge not creaking. This is not really surprising. Both men came from nowhere, mavericks hoisted to the highest offices of their lands by a wave of disgust at politics-as-usual. They are, in their way, accidents of history, thrust to power at the passing of an era. Longing for disruption produced these two disrupters. Both laid waste to the political establishment, either smashing or co-opting mainstream parties. Both understood the fact that voters were bored as well as angry, mistrustful of the liberal consensus, angry at globalization’s predations, restive for grandeur, thirsty for the outspoken rather than the dutiful warnings of experts. Macron, who at 40 could be Trump’s son, has honed a grandiose theater of the center, thereby giving centrist politics new vigor at a time of extremist temptation. He’s tough on immigration because he knows his survival depends on it. Trump’s is the theater of the zigzagging bully, nonstop noise often drowning out meaning. For both men, movement and action are essential. Gaullist pomp, shunned by Macron’s predecessor, is back. If that’s what it takes to defeat the racist National Front, bring it on. Macron celebrated his victory last year with an address to the French people at the Louvre, greeted Putin at Versailles, and returned to the Sun King’s palace this year for a “Choose France” summit meeting of global C.E.O.s to trumpet some $3 billion in foreign investment. “It’s not ‘Make France Great Again’ — except that it is, sort of,” a French friend observed. Macron’s Bastille Day celebration — complete with guards on horseback, troops, tanks and fighter jets — so impressed his special guest, Trump, that Trump now wants his own version with a heavy air component (but sans tanks) on Veterans Day. Ridiculous? I think this friendship is so important as Trump surrounds himself with hawks that I’m prepared to swallow hard. Or rather, it’s potentially so important. We have yet to see what Macron can leverage from this relationship. We don’t know if it’s a nice thing or a beneficial thing. It did not stop Trump from leaving the climate accord or recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The jury is still out. Trump did exempt the European Union from steel and aluminum tariffs, an issue on which the French had pressed hard. “If we are viewed like China, that would be a big problem,” one senior official told me before Trump’s decision. Next up: Iran. If Macron cannot avert the worst on Iran — a decision by Trump on May 12 to torpedo the nuclear deal by no longer waiving sanctions — then all bets are off. The accord, which reversed the program that had made Iran a threshold nuclear power, is working. The French are determined to preserve it. If it collapses, the Shia-Sunni Middle Eastern confrontation will worsen, Iran may race for a bomb, and Saudi Arabia will not be far behind. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty could fray to the point of meaninglessness. The signs are not good. Mike Pompeo, nominated by Trump as the next secretary of state, is an Iran hawk. John Bolton, the new national security adviser who will replace Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, wants to abrogate the nuclear deal and bring down the Iranian regime — and that’s just for starters. Devastation looms. Macron’s — and Europe’s — challenge in blocking Iran folly has just grown tougher. As Trump’s behavior becomes more erratic, a trend the Russia investigation will only accentuate in the coming months, the Macron friendship is some insurance against the worst. Unlike Trump, the French president knows what he wants and is capable of pursuing a coherent strategy. He’s also a bulwark against all the destructiveness Trump has embraced: ethno-nationalist bigotry, the growing authoritarianism of Putin and Xi Jinping, the erosion of the rule of law, trade wars, the militarization of foreign policy and the undercutting of the European Union. Macron’s vision of restored greatness is consistent with French ideals. Trump’s involves the betrayal of America’s. There’s the difference. A lot hinges on this being a friendship that delivers.",5.0
2089366,Asian-Americans Suing Harvard Say Admissions Files Show Discrimination,"A group that is suing Harvard University is demanding that it publicly release admissions data on hundreds of thousands of applicants, saying the records show a pattern of discrimination against Asian-Americans going back decades. The group was able to view the documents through its lawsuit, which was filed in 2014 and challenges Harvard’s admissions policies. The plaintiffs said in a letter to the court last week that the documents were so compelling that there was no need for a trial, and that they would ask the judge to rule summarily in their favor based on the documents alone. The plaintiffs also say that the public — which provides more than half a billion dollars a year in federal funding to Harvard — has a right to see the evidence that the judge will consider in her decision. Harvard counters that the documents are tantamount to trade secrets, and that even in the unlikely event that the judge agrees to decide the case without a trial, she is likely to use only a fraction of the evidence in her decision. Only that portion, the university says, should be released. “This is an important and closely watched civil rights case,” William S. Consovoy, the lawyer for the group, Students for Fair Admissions, said in his letter to the court. “The public has a right to know exactly what is going on at Harvard. Even if this were a commercial issue — as Harvard would like to portray it — the public would have a right to know if the product is defective or if a fraud is being perpetrated.” At stake in the dispute is the secrecy of the university admissions process, especially at elite institutions like Harvard that are competing for a small pool of highly qualified students, and whether and how race and ethnicity play a role. Students for Fair Admissions includes more than a dozen Asian-American students who applied to Harvard and were rejected. They contend in their lawsuit that Harvard systematically and unconstitutionally discriminates against Asian-American applicants by penalizing their high achievement as a group, while giving preferences to other racial and ethnic minorities. They say that Harvard’s admission process amounts to an illegal quota system. A spokeswoman for Harvard, Rachael Dane, while declining to comment on the specifics of the litigation, said: “Harvard College does not discriminate against applicants from any group in its admissions processes. We will continue to vigorously defend the right of Harvard, and other universities, to seek the educational benefits that come from a class that is diverse on multiple dimensions.” Harvard gave the court the documents in question, which include six years of admissions data on hundreds of thousands of high school students, as part of the pretrial discovery process. About 40,000 students apply to Harvard each year. The judge in the case, Allison D. Burroughs of the Federal District Court in Boston, has scheduled a hearing on April 10 for both sides to present oral arguments on whether the documents should be made public. The two sides provided lengthy letters to Judge Burroughs, giving a preview of their arguments. The judge has set a trial date for next January, though Harvard in its letter said it was prepared to go to trial as soon as October. The contents of the documents have been only roughly sketched out in court papers. But Harvard said in its letter that the parties have exchanged more than 90,000 pages, including “deeply personal and highly sensitive information about applicants to and students at Harvard and the inner workings of Harvard’s admissions process.” “Harvard understands that there is a public interest in this case and that the public has certain — though not unfettered — interests in access to judicial materials,” the university said. “Those interests, however, must be balanced against the need to protect individual privacy and confidential and proprietary information about the admissions process.” The leader of Students for Fair Admissions and the architect of the case against Harvard is Edward Blum, a longtime crusader against affirmative action who has recruited plaintiffs, hired sympathetic lawyers and raised millions of dollars from conservative groups to challenge voting rights laws and affirmative action policies, often successfully. One of Mr. Blum’s landmark cases was a lawsuit by Abigail Fisher, a white applicant who said she was denied admission to the University of Texas at Austin because of her race. The United States Supreme Court ruled 4-3 in favor of the university in 2016, saying that it is constitutional to use race as one of many factors in admissions decisions. Critics have seen the lawsuit against Harvard, which seems intended to go to the Supreme Court, as an attempt to reignite that battle. The Trump administration has taken an interest in the issue, opening a parallel investigation based on a separate 2015 complaint to the Justice Department by a coalition of Asian-American organizations. In its letter to the judge, Harvard said that it had an obligation to protect the identities of applicants, who take it on faith that their applications will remain private. While names and other information that could directly identify applicants have been redacted from the documents, the university said that hometowns, awards and other elements could reveal applicants’ identities through simple internet searches. The documents also include deposition testimony concerning the procedures Harvard used to evaluate applications; internal correspondence among admissions officers about applicants’ qualities; and statements by admissions officers about why they liked some applicants better than others. “That information is highly proprietary to Harvard and of great interest to college admissions consultants and others who seek any advantage they can muster in the highly competitive admissions process,” Harvard said in its letter. Releasing it “would put Harvard at a severe competitive disadvantage,” the university said, and would prompt applicants to try to game the system. Students for Fair Admissions scoffed at the notion that the admissions procedure was akin to a trade secret. “This case does not involve anything like ‘national security, the formula for Coca-Cola or embarrassing details of private life,’ ” the group said, citing case law. The group noted that Harvard officials have repeatedly said that there is no formula for being admitted, and that books and articles have been written about how the Harvard admissions process works. The plaintiffs cited a landmark affirmative action case, Gratz v. Bollinger, in which the Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that the University of Michigan was using an unconstitutional scoring system for undergraduate admissions. The system automatically awarded 20 out of 150 points toward admission to members of underrepresented minorities. “There is no way the public could have understood the dispute,” the group said, “if the facts had been hidden.”",3.5
2091689,Review: Anna Netrebko Emerges as a Powerful New Tosca at the Met,"Anna Netrebko must have felt enormous pressure on Saturday at the Metropolitan Opera when for the first time anywhere she sang the title role of Puccini’s “Tosca.” This is a touchstone of the soprano repertory. Ms. Netrebko, who over many years has been moving from the lighter, bel canto fare into weightier dramatic roles, could have chosen a less prominent stage to try out Tosca. Ms. Netrebko knew what she was doing. She was a magnificent Tosca. From her first entrance, Ms. Netrebko, one of the opera world’s genuine prima donnas, seemed every bit Puccini’s volatile heroine, an acclaimed diva in the Rome of 1800, seized in the moment with jealous suspicions over her lover, the painter Mario Cavaradossi. As she hurled accusations at Mario — Why was the church door locked? Who were you whispering with? I heard a woman’s rustling skirt! — it took a couple of minutes for Ms. Netrebko’s voice to warm up fully. By the time Tosca, having pushed doubts aside, beguiles Mario into a rendezvous at his villa that night, Ms. Netrebko’s singing was plush, radiant and suffused with romantic yearning. Her Tosca is a woman used to getting her way. That she loves Mario so deeply rattles her. Having been reassured by Mario’s sweet talk, Tosca, with a touch of mock despair, sings, “You know how to make me love you.” With melting sound and disarming vulnerability, Ms. Netrebko made this crucial line seem especially revealing, a moment of helpless resignation. It must have lent Ms. Netrebko confidence to have her husband, the Azerbaijan tenor Yusif Eyvazov, singing Mario. (The Met announced this month that Marcelo Álvarez would not sing the role in this six-performance run, specifying no reason.) Mr. Eyvazov is a husky-bodied man with a voice to match. He sings with burly sound touched with a metallic glint. His big top notes have stinging power. Ms. Netrebko was also fortunate to have the compelling baritone Michael Volle as Scarpia, Rome’s tyrannical police chief. Though Scarpia is a sexual predator who lusts after Tosca, he deploys aristocratic airs to get his way. Mr. Volle deftly modulated his singing, one moment spinning a phrase with seductive allure, the next erupting with chilling power. That Mr. Volle has become a major Wagnerian whose sound has a Germanic, dark cast, lacking typical Italianate warmth, just made him seem more threatening, like an outsider. At first, Tosca proved an easy mark for this cagey Scarpia. Though Ms. Netrebko can be an impetuous singer, I was struck right through her performance by how she melded emotional intensity and musical integrity. When she looked at the suspicious fan, belonging to a woman, that Scarpia had found near Mario’s easel, Ms. Netrebko sang Tosca’s anguished response as a series of clearly defined melodic phrases. Her approach actually enhanced the music’s poignancy, lending Tosca some dignity even as she suspects that Mario has deceived her. I can’t remember when I’ve seen such a shattering performance of this opera’s harrowing second act. When Mr. Volle’s Scarpia questioned Tosca to find out where Mario had hidden the escaped prisoner Angelotti, Ms. Netrebko’s Tosca proved not just a bad liar but a clueless innocent. Once she realized that Mario had been taken into a side chamber not just to be interrogated but to be tortured, Ms. Netrebko erupted with searing, frenzied horror. During this #MeToo era, it was hard to watch Scarpia try to ply Tosca with wine, then lay his hands around her exposed neck and admit that her hatred of him was a turn-on. Ms. Netrebko made Tosca’s aria “Vissi d’arte,” sung with arching lyricism and enveloping richness, both a questioning prayer to God and a private moment of soul-searching. When, seeing no other way out, Tosca stabs Scarpia with a knife, Ms. Netrebko showed us a woman in a moment of existential realization. Even while carrying out the act, you could see disbelief registered on her face and in the tortured motions of her body: Am I actually doing this? Murdering someone? She and Mr. Eyvazov performed Act III like lovers caught in a daze of confusion, with Tosca trying to convince herself she has found a rescue plan for her lover and Mario looking like he knows the bullets from the firing squad will be real. The conductor Bertrand de Billy led a coursing, richly detailed and colorful account of the score. David McVicar’s essentially realistic new production was introduced on New Year’s Eve this season and has been much debated, but I hardly thought about it on this night. The entire performance was excellent. But the arrival of a great new Tosca was the big news.",4.5
2096326,"Pulled From Rockefeller Walls, Picasso, Matisse and Monet Fetch Big Prices","With $115 million, the winning bidder for “Fillette à la Corbeille Fleurie” (Young Girl With Basket of Flowers) at Christie’s on Tuesday night took ownership of one of the most expensive Picassos ever sold. Included in the price: a whiff of association with its previous owners, a couple whose names were synonymous with wealth, taste and privilege. The painting, along with dozens of other first-rate artworks and hundreds of pieces of furniture, ceramics, porcelain and knickknacks on sale this week, belonged to David and Peggy Rockefeller, potent symbols of New York society and formidable collectors and philanthropists. That provenance prompted vigorous bidding at the auction house’s Rockefeller Center headquarters on Tuesday; many of the 44 pieces went for well over the high estimate and seven set new auction highs for their artists, including for Matisse and Monet. “What do you think the greatest name in America is for wealth?” said the art adviser Neal Meltzer. “In the 21st century we have a new form of sovereign wealth and those individuals can relate to this family.” Christie’s is hoping this aspirational drive fuels sales that exceed $1 billion by the end of the week, a figure that would be a first for an auction. The Rockefeller auction, whose proceeds will go to various charities, comes on the heels of a history-making sale last fall at Christie’s: Leonardo da Vinci’s “Salvator Mundi” for $450.3 million. The first real test of the power of Rockefeller was Tuesday night, an auction of 19th and 20th century art. The results were encouraging, totaling $646 million with fees — the pre-sale estimate was $490 million — and every lot sold. “It’s really fabulous,” said the collector Donald B. Marron, who referred to the works’ provenance as the “Rockefeller premium.” “It’s nice to see things that are modern, rather than contemporary, bringing good prices.” Jockeying for the rights to the auction started not long after Mr. Rockefeller, the last surviving grandson of the oil baron John D. Rockefeller, died last year at 101; Peggy Rockefeller died in 1996. Christie’s defeated its rival Sotheby’s by guaranteeing the Rockefellers’ estate a minimum total price of $650 million, according to a person familiar with the terms of the deal. That is a large gamble for an auction house since it has to cover any shortfall, though Christie’s was able to shift some of the risk to outside investors. The Picasso was the highest priced lot, with a pre-sale estimate of $100 million; the painting from the artist’s Rose period held pride of place in Mr. Rockefeller’s library. It was among a trove of artwork acquired from Gertrude Stein’s estate in 1968 by a syndicate of prominent collectors that included Mr. Rockefeller’s brother Nelson and the CBS chairman, William S. Paley. David Rockefeller drew first pick and chose the Picasso. But the 1905 canvas was by no means a guaranteed crowd-pleaser. Depicting a naked teenage girl with a basket of flowers, “Fillette à la Corbeille Fleurie” is widely acclaimed but, given the cultural #MeToo moment, potentially discomfiting. Moreover, the painting is not immediately recognizable as a Picasso, given its figurative style. Sure enough, the bidding never took off for that top lot on Tuesday, despite the best and exceedingly patient efforts of the auctioneer, Jussi Pylkkanen. The hammer came down at $102 million, just over the estimate, with the total reaching $115 million with fees. The winning bid came in by phone. “I think they overhyped what they thought it might bring,” said the dealer Larry Gagosian as he left the sale. “It’s all about managing expectations.” But Guillaume Cerutti, the chief executive of Christie’s, said he was unfazed. “We thought it would go in the $100 million range — it’s O.K.,” he said. “At that level, it’s difficult to predict.” And Almine Ruiz-Picasso, who owns the Almine Rech Gallery and is married to Bernard Ruiz-Picasso, a grandson of the artist, said she was not surprised the painting did not go for more. “It’s a very historical work,” she said. “It’s for a certain type of collector that is maybe more limited.” In 2015, Christie’s sold the most expensive Picasso to date, “Les Femmes d’Alger (Version ‘O’)” for $179 million. Another big prize of the evening, Matisse’s 1923 “Odalisque Couchée aux Magnolias,” a sensual nude on a green striped chaise, went for $80.8 million following an estimate of $70 million, with five phone bidders and two in the room driving the price to a new auction high for the artist. Although the demand for Impressionists has paled in comparison to the craze over contemporary art, the Rockefeller’s holdings in this category nevertheless attracted several bidders. Monet’s “Nymphéas en Fleur” (“Water Lilies in Bloom”), one of the artist’s celebrated water lilies, generated some of the night’s stiffest competition. Fielding bids from several different places in the room and on the phones, Mr. Pylkkanen joked: “It’s like a tennis game with five rackets.” At the $71 million mark, he added, “It’s never too late to jump in.” The hammer came down at $75 million, and the $84.7 million sale price with fees was an auction high for Monet. Buyers’ identities were not disclosed but Christie’s said that some were institutions that will be announced at a later date. “Live like a Rockefeller,” was Christie’s pitch for the week of sales, betting on the idea that people would seek to take home some relic of American royalty, however small. The pieces had hung on the walls and decorated the rooms of the couple’s various homes. In addition to the multimillion dollar paintings in Tuesday’s evening sale, half of the Rockefeller material — more than 1,500 lots — was put online, making it available to a broad swath of people at varying price points. The items included a pair of silver salt and pepper shakers (estimated at $400 to $600); a covered porcelain tureen shaped like a carp ($8,000 to $12,000); a pair of aquamarine and gold cuff links in the shape of martini glasses that had already reached $6,000 online by Tuesday evening; and the dessert service that Napoleon took to his exile in Elba ($150,000 to $250,000). The sales at Christie’s continue on Wednesday and Thursday, with online bidding ending on Friday. “This is the creation of the fantasy — how a Rockefeller could live,” said Marc Porter, the chairman of Christie’s Americas, in an interview before the sale. “For most of the world, it’s about the glamour of it.” Christie’s was also banking on Asian interest in blue-chip American fare — premiering the sale’s highlights in Hong Kong; mounting special marketing campaigns in China and Japan; and bringing paintings to collectors in Shanghai and Beijing. These efforts bore fruit on Tuesday night. The victorious bids for the Matisse and Monet were taken by Xin Li Cohen, the deputy chairman of Christie’s Asia, indicating they came from Asia. For previews in New York, Christie’s transformed its main sales room into a faux garden and aviary, with piped-in bird song, to conjure up the Rockefellers’ home in Pocantico Hills, N.Y. and show off some of the porcelain pieces, many of which feature images of parrots, falcons and quails. Also on display was a sumptuous picnic spread, including the Rockefellers’ English wicker hamper with settings for 12, a gift from King Hassan II of Morocco ($5,000 to $10,000).",3.0
2097901,White Man Is Accused of Seeking a Hit Man to Lynch His Black Neighbor: ‘$500 and He’s a Ghost’,"A white man in South Carolina sought a hit man to kill his black neighbor, hang the body from a tree and leave a “flaming cross” on the neighbor’s lawn, according to a court filing. Fortunately for the neighbor, the hit man was an undercover agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The man accused of doing the hiring, Brandon Cory Lecroy, 25, was indicted by a grand jury this week on two charges related to the scheme. He faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 if convicted. According to an arrest warrant affidavit, a confidential source tipped off the F.B.I. on March 19 that Mr. Lecroy, of Hodges, S.C., had reached out to an unnamed white supremacist organization seeking help in the murder. The following day, the F.B.I. agent posing as a hit man spoke with Mr. Lecroy, who texted him images and names of two targets, including the neighbor, identified in the charging document by the initials F.J. Mr. Lecroy told the agent over the phone, “$500 and he’s a ghost,” according to the affidavit. He also asked that a “flaming cross” be left in the yard and that the neighbor be hanged from a tree. While this plan was more elaborate than most, it is not uncommon for law enforcement officials to hear of someone asking about murder-for-hire and then for them to pose as hit men to make an arrest. In March, for example, a Manhattan man was arrested after the F.B.I. said he enlisted an undercover agent in an expanding scheme to eliminate noisy neighbors. In August, a Florida woman was sentenced to 16 years in prison after negotiating the murder of her husband with an undercover police officer, recorded for posterity in a video now on YouTube. Ohio has been transfixed for years by the case against Tara Lambert, a former model accused of hiring an undercover sheriff’s deputy to kill the mother of her stepchildren. She pleaded not guilty a second time in February, after a prior conviction was overturned on appeal. For fans of the genre, Mr. Lecroy’s plot followed a predictable course, according to court documents. A few days after the first conversation, he confirmed the agreement in a second phone call with the agent. He recommended times for the murder, described his plan to take his neighbor’s land and promised more jobs to come. He also made one more request. He wanted a “ghost gun,” an untraceable 9-millimeter handgun that hadn’t been stolen, along with two clips. It was not disclosed what he planned to do with the gun. Then, the plan escalated. On April 9, Mr. Lecroy met the agent in person, pointing out the neighbor’s residence, discussing the future jobs, and handing over a $100 down payment. Mr. Lecroy was arrested soon after and booked into a South Carolina detention center the following afternoon. The judge in the case ordered that Mr. Lecroy get a psychological evaluation. His lawyer declined to comment and a spokesman for the United States Attorney’s Office in South Carolina did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An arraignment hearing is scheduled for later this month.",4.0
2099257,"Colombia Elects Iván Duque, a Young Populist, as President","BOGOTÁ, Colombia — Iván Duque, a populist young conservative who tapped into dissatisfaction with the economy and a contentious peace deal with rebels, won Colombia’s presidential vote on Sunday. Mr. Duque, a former senator from the right-wing Democratic Center party, won about 54 percent of the vote in the second and last round of elections, election officials said. He defeated Gustavo Petro, a former guerrilla member and onetime mayor of Bogotá, the capital, who got about 42 percent. Mr. Duque’s showing capped a remarkable political rise. Buoyed by charm and a conservative upwelling in Colombia, he secured the presidency in an election where many who voted for him did not even know his name a year ago. At 41, he will be one of the youngest presidents in the country’s history. Far better known is Mr. Duque’s longtime mentor, Álvaro Uribe, a firebrand ex-president who delivered pummeling blows against the country’s main rebel group and drug traffickers over his eight years in office, from 2002 to 2010. Blocked by term limits from returning to the post, Mr. Uribe now holds a Senate seat from which he wields outsize power. He founded his own party; emerged as the chief antagonist to his successor, the departing president, Juan Manuel Santos; led the charge against a peace deal with the rebels; and chose Mr. Duque, as his preferred candidate. Mr. Duque rebuffed suggestions that Mr. Uribe would govern through him were he to win. But it was clear Sunday that the close relationship between the men helped Mr. Duque get many of the votes that were cast. “I don’t know why people say they fear Uribe,” Delia de Rojas, 75, a widow who receives a military pension, said after casting her vote for Mr. Duque. “He was the one that put order in the country,” she said. “Now with Duque, we will have that another time.” The election was the first to be held since the end of Colombia’s war with its main rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC. For generations, the conflict was the center of presidential politics. Yet how the peace deal signed by Mr. Santos was to be put into effect was not often discussed in the campaign, and sometimes appeared to be an afterthought. Instead, Colombia moved toward a new set of questions: How should the country tackle the corruption scandals that have hit it, along with other countries in the region? What should be done about the rising number of Venezuelan refugees who have poured over the country’s borders? What is to be done about rising coca production? But the war carries a long shadow, and the peace deal affected the fortunes of both men on the presidential ballot. Mr. Duque was aided by his party’s long opposition to the peace deal; it argued that it was too lenient on drug traffickers. Many who voted the deal down after a referendum in 2016 gave their votes to Mr. Duque. The end of the war with the FARC appeared to help Mr. Petro, too, as the first serious left-wing candidate for president in years. Some analysts said peace may have softened the stance of many Colombians against ex-rebels, allowing a former guerrilla to make headway. The campaign may offer some hints as to how Mr. Duque will govern. He published a book called “The Future Is at the Political Center” this year and backed off some of his party’s more right-wing stances. And while he has expressed doubts about the peace deal agreed to in 2016, he has not asked to overturn it. He has, though, suggested some modifications. “It strikes me as odd that they box him in as someone with positions that are radical,” said Felipe Buitrago, a friend of Mr. Duque, who worked with him at the Inter-American Development Bank before he entered politics. On combating drugs, his stances have appeared closer to his mentor, Mr. Uribe. Mr. Duque has supported a return to aerial spraying of coca crops. The Santos government had banned spraying over health concerns about the chemical used. Mr. Duque also is against considering the legalization of some drugs, a growing trend among Latin American countries. “He will return to the iron fist of coordination with the U.S.,” said Arlene Tickner, a political scientist at Del Rosario University in Bogotá. Mr. Petro, for his part, ran a campaign in which he denounced the corruption of top politicians and said that for both economic and environmental reasons he would phase out coal and oil exports, saying the country relied too much on hydrocarbons. As mayor of Bogotá, he had success reducing prices for public transportation and gave subsidized water to the poor, but he was also briefly impeached after a standoff with officials over city garbage collection. Mr. Petro’s history as a fighter appealed to Jairo Montoya, 20, a hotel student in Bogotá who was one of many young people who turned out to vote for him on Sunday. He said he saw the former guerrilla as a catalyst for structural changes in the country. “It’s time to bring down those who have always been in power,” he said, referring to politicians like Mr. Duque and Mr. Uribe. “It’s time to have another kind of government.” Such sentiments, however, may have been against the tide in a country which ranks among the region’s most conservative. Many of the biggest debates now center on the hot-button culture wars that have consumed politics in other countries. “I am not for abortion, not for same-sex marriage — and Petro is,” said Carlota Jaimes, 42, an accountant. “I don’t think to protect women, young people and Christian values, it’s all right to be in favor of these things.” Ms. Jaimes cast her vote for Mr. Duque, and headed out of the polling booth.",3.5
2099472,Dipsea: A Trail Race Where ‘You’re Either the Hunter or the Hunted’,"Winners over the past decade include an 8-year-old girl (barely beating a 68-year-old woman) and a 72-year-old man. Runners careening down a section of the Dipsea, a 7.5-mile trail race in Marin County.CreditCreditFrankie Frost for The New York Times STINSON BEACH, Calif. — The toughest part of the Dipsea, said to be the country’s oldest trail-running race, might not be the first mile, which contains nearly 700 stairs rising through the forests above Mill Valley. It is not the jiggly-legged drop into Muir Woods, or the steep rise up Dynamite, so named because your churning legs might feel ready to explode. And it is not even the next big hill, called Cardiac. (If your legs have not burst, maybe your heart will.) It is not the treacherous plunge toward the ocean, the crooked depths and broken steps of Steep Ravine, even the poison oak that crowds the skinny trails and tickles the legs before blooming into a postrace rash. And it’s not the course’s maze of permissible shortcuts, like the one named Suicide, that give locals an advantage, as long as they stay upright and do not get lost. No, unexpectedly, the toughest part of the 7.5-mile Dipsea, a topographically schizophrenic romp that was first run in 1905, could be mental. It is knowing that the slowest runners are given head starts and the fastest ones begin at the back. It is like unloading a zoo’s worth of animals in reverse order of mobility and releasing the cheetahs at the end. The race is handicapped in an unusually calculated attempt to get the top runners in every age group to the finish line at the same time. The youngest children and the oldest adults are stacked at the front. The fittest, fastest men are at the back, released 25 minutes later. Everyone else starts in waves in between, distributed by a complex algorithm of gender and age. A different wave is released from the starting line every minute, each one (theoretically) moving faster than the one before it. “It’s a very different dynamic,” said Alex Varner, a 32-year-old who, before this year’s race last Sunday, had the fastest Dipsea time seven times — but had never won, not quite able to sprint and maneuver past every one of the 600 to 700 competitors who started in front of him. “You’re either the hunter or the hunted.” That is how the winners over the past decade include an 8-year-old girl (barely beating a 68-year-old woman) and a 72-year-old man. And that is how I started Sunday’s race five minutes behind the defending champion, a 47-year-old woman named Chris Lundy. Dipsea organizers placed me, comically, in the “invitational” section for accomplished runners, rather than the broader “runner” section behind it. Starting in the thick of the competitive pack would provide a better perspective of the race. At my age, 50, with a six-minute head start in front of the “scratch” runners — those in the last group, men ages 19 to 30 — most of the invitational section would start in front of me, including all the women. I live not far from where the race takes place, and I jog the hills a few times a week, five or six miles at a time. Barry Spitz, author of “Dipsea: The Greatest Race” and the longtime finish-line announcer, asked me over coffee last month what other races I regularly run. Well, none, really, I said. He silently and skeptically scanned me from head to toe and back again. “I don’t mean to be negative, but you probably won’t pass anyone,” he said. Seeking an outsider’s perspective, and a more optimistic one, I called Amby Burfoot, the longtime editor of Runner’s World and the 1968 Boston Marathon champion. The Dipsea was on his must-do list for decades, he said. He finally did last year, at age 70. Burfoot thought, with his 21-minute head start, he might finish in the top 100. He finished 541st, with the 1,063rd-fastest time (1 hour 37 minutes 31 seconds). “Never in my life have I been passed by so many people,” he said. This month, he said, he was headed on vacation, not to the Dipsea. “It’s a fabulous race,” Burfoot said, “but I don’t have an urge to do it again.” In 1904, as Spitz tells it, more than 30 years before Marin County was connected to San Francisco by a bridge across the Golden Gate, someone had the idea of racing between the Mill Valley train depot and the Dipsea Inn, on the sand of what later became Stinson Beach. There was no course, just wild terrain and a few scattered trails up and around the shoulders of 2,571-foot Mount Tamalpais. A man named Charles Boas apparently beat another named Alfons Coney and, deemed a success, the two-man event was renewed into an annual race beginning in 1905. It is considered the second-oldest major running race in the country, behind the Boston Marathon, which started in 1897. Organizers made two monumental decisions at the outset. One was not setting a precise route; runners could create their own path, deciding if a shorter but steeper incline, for example, was better than a longer way around. That notion persists, far more limited these days because of environmental concerns surrounding an otherwise established “consensus” course. But there are still places where even the top runners pass someone, only to see that person ahead of them again later in the race. “Short cuts are kind of like the family jewels,” said Roy Rivers, a former winner. “If you have one, you don’t talk about it.” The second, more notable decision was the use of head starts. “Sometimes it’s the right thing to do to give other people a better chance to win,” said James Weil, an M.I.T.-educated engineer who has been the Dipsea’s handicapper for about 40 years. Weil uses historical race data to conclude, for instance, that 60-year-old men should be placed in the same starting group as 12-year-old girls and women ages 45 to 48, all leaving the starting line 12 minutes before the scratch runners. Theoretically, if you are the best among your age and gender, you could finish first. “I want the winner to win by less than a minute,” Weil said. “I want the top 10 finishers to have started in different groups. And I want a representation of women in the top five. The fourth criteria, which is really difficult, I would like a scratch runner in the top 10. I don’t think I’ve done all four. I’ve done the first three.” Handicapping, and the headache of starting at the rear, is one reason most world-class runners do not bother with the Dipsea. Besides, there is no prize money. A scratch runner has not won the race since 1966. “There’s no incentive for them,” Spitz said. “There’s no money. It’s dangerous. It’s in June, in peak racing season. They have bigger fish to fry.” Typical contenders are locals who know the course intimately. They are often strong Dipsea veterans in their 40s, 50s and 60s — those who turn a year older and gain another minute of a head start, but whose actual running time does not increase a minute. As Spitz said during Sunday’s award ceremony, if you want to win, or at least get one of the treasured black shirts given to the top 35 finishers, “get faster and get older.” The actor Robin Williams ran it a couple of times. (“Besides the hills, the stairs and the downhill, it wasn’t bad,” he said after finishing a respectable 232nd in 1984.) So did a young Robert S. Mueller III, long before his pursuits included the current president. Elmo Shropshire, known for singing “Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer,” has run it 17 times. Now 81, and still running competitively, he stopped doing the Dipsea a few years ago. “When you’re 75, you max out the head start minutes you get,” Shropshire said last week. “I was falling back in the pack, and it felt like it was getting a little dangerous.” The local flavor makes the Dipsea feel like a throwback in an era of gimmicky races. The starting area in Mill Valley on every second Sunday in June has the mellow air of a farmer’s market, not a major sporting event. The race has no costumes, no man-made obstacles, no music. Sponsor names are not strewn about the course or the back of T-shirts. (“We like the shirt to look like a race shirt, not a billboard,” said Edda Stickle, the race director.) There is no encampment of sponsor tents and giveaways at the beach-side finish. The Dipsea is routinely approached by big-name sponsors, including one recently, offering lots of money and outfits for the army of volunteers. “It’d be the so-and-so Dipsea Race,” Stickle said, dismissively. “We said thank you, but this will be nothing but the Dipsea race.” I never saw Varner go past. But less than a mile into the race, climbing staircases so long that the top cannot be seen from the bottom, I was aware that dozens were passing me. They were getting younger by the minute. Beyond the race’s midpoint, heading downhill, the field thinned. I was alone when I ducked under a fallen tree to take a well-used shortcut called “the swoop,” a thin, tangled thread of a trail dropping fast through thorny thickets and trees. Relieved to hear no footsteps behind me, I tripped over a hidden root and fell into a bush, bruising only my ego. I later passed the feet of person on a stretcher sticking out of the bushes, surrounded by three paramedics who smiled and told me everything was fine. I learned later that a teenage girl somewhere else collapsed and was helicoptered to a hospital. (She was released later in the day.) The week before the race, I interviewed 80-year-old Russ Kiernan, a three-time winner who had won 30 black shirts in 49 career starts. On Sunday, he got dizzy at Cardiac and was taken away by stretcher. (He, too, was home that night.) More people caught me. It is the downhill dashes where the top runners make up the most time, bounding down steps and rocks and daringly passing the competition on narrow and tight corners like short-track speedskaters. There is a lot of touching, hands on sweaty backs and shoulders, to keep in control. (The late Jack Kirk, who finished the Dipsea 67 times in a row, the last when he was 95, took to wearing a shirt that read “Do Not Touch Me” on the back.) Only occasionally does the convivial civility turn to trail rage. One man shoved another at the finish line, sending him tumbling into the timing equipment. I was not there yet. Darting down a meandering trail overgrown with bushes, I heard footsteps behind me. “On your left!” a voice shouted over my shoulder. It was followed by an “oops!” and a “sorry!” as the man bounced past me on the right and disappeared into the bramble. Nobody gobbled up more runners than Varner, who began with a one-minute head start on the scratch runners. He ran at Davidson College and finished 26th at the 2013 Boston Marathon. He lives in Marin County, does a few trail races a year, and seems pleasantly unbothered by his inability to win the Dipsea. By the last mile, he had only one more person to catch: Lundy, a local veterinarian and an accomplished national trail runner. In 2017, she had an 11-minute head start on Varner and beat him to the finish by 20 seconds. This time, she had a 10-minute head start. She, too, had passed hundreds by the time she topped out at Cardiac, where the Pacific Ocean comes into view. When she slid past 60-year-old Diana Fitzpatrick, a former champion, on the spiraling steps into Steep Ravine, about six miles in, she figured she must be in the lead. “But I knew Alex was closing in,” she said later. Varner ran out of time and space again. Despite one of his fastest times ever, 48:51, and the race’s overall fastest time for the eighth time, he finished in second, again, this time 15 seconds behind Lundy. “I was closer than I was last year, but she’s such a strong runner,” Varner said. “I ran what I hoped to run. No complaints.” Nine of the top 11 came from different start groups. Winners of the 35 black shirts included three teenagers and seven runners in their 60s. Their median age was 53. The top scratch runner finished 30th. “I’ve resigned myself to the fact that I might have to wait 10, 20 years before I win,” Varner said. “It’s the way the race is designed. They did it because they want to give everybody a shot, and if you look at the results, it works out remarkably well. It’s hard to argue with.” I finished 580th. By my calculations, analyzing the final results, I was passed by 247 people. The good news is that I passed 39. And in another two years, if I get the urge to do the Dipsea again, I will gain another minute of a head start. OpinionLindsay Crouse",2.5
2104632,"If Comedy Is Making You Feel Bad, You’re Not Paying Attention","On Comedy At the Rally to Restore Sanity in 2010, Jon Stewart delivered a funny political speech to a crowd of his fans on the mall in Washington, D.C. He praised reasonableness, compromise and the virtue of working together with our opponents. Insanity however proved resilient. Last month, he told an audience that it was an error to mistake cultural power for real power, adding: “I, being a part of that machine and mechanism, do feel oddly culpable.” For Mr. Stewart, who more than anyone elevated the political stature of the late-night talk show, to make such a concession is jarring. But it fits the mood right now, one defined not by the army of his television successors but by the Australian stand-up Hannah Gadsby. Her ferocious special “Nanette” tapped into a growing cultural anxiety about the limits of comedy. She skewered the nature of jokes, arguing that because they inevitably lead to incomplete stories, they evade difficult truths. [Hannah Gadsby on the toll of performing “Nanette.”] The media gravitated to her bracingly categorical argument. Slate announced that “Nanette” was evidence that comedy was “broken,” and a Vulture review concluded from her argument that jokes “can’t really challenge or change anything — and are therefore more conservative than progressive.” Such critiques are just as common in the conservative media. Reviewing Sacha Baron Cohen’s new series, “Who Is America?,” a critic for The Federalist lamented, “Comedy is supposed to connect us as humans. Now it’s tearing us apart.” When did comedy become the worst medicine? It is a relatively new development. Until recently, comedy had been rapidly expanding, increasingly co-opting areas of our culture previously dominated by sober voices. One of the most memorable responses to the Sept. 11 attacks was David Letterman’s emotional on-air speech processing his grief, which set a precedent for talk-show hosts offering healing words after national tragedies. Corporations and business schools now regularly hire troupes like Second City to teach them how the principles of improv can help their bottom line. But the role of comedy has particularly moved into the political sphere. Before he left the series in 2015, Mr. Stewart’s “Daily Show” was a trusted news source for many young people, frequently earning him comparisons to Walter Cronkite, and political analysis with funny quips became part of the nightly ritual of comedy. When Sarah Silverman spoke alongside then-Senator Al Franken at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, the fact that a onetime comedian and a current one were playing roles at the highest level of presidential politics didn’t even seem notable. In the past year or so, there has been a backlash to the growing role of comedy, and as with nearly every cultural trend these days, Donald J. Trump has something to do with it. He became famous in part because of comedy institutions; he was a fixture on roasts, late-night talk shows and Howard Stern. But once he ran for president, comedians obsessed about him as much as cable-news hosts did. Despite the endless internet headlines trumpeting how this host eviscerated him or that comic destroyed Mr. Trump, none did. This clarified what comedy could accomplish. On her new Netflix series, Michelle Wolf, a veteran of “The Daily Show,” brilliantly satirized the self-importance of current comedy, skewering the entire genre of righteous political humor that Mr. Stewart gave birth to, mocking its ineffectuality while breaking down the hack conventions of a bit that always ends with the same Trump insult. “Writing jokes is hard. It’s really hard,” she said. “You know what’s easier? An earnest plea.” Where Ms. Gadsby suggests that jokes obscure a comedian’s ability to tell the full truth, Ms. Wolf argues that the imperative to go viral with a sincere insult has gotten in the way of being funny. Then there were the many comedians accused of sexual misconduct. Their private behavior was often at odds with their public profile, and since audiences put more stock in the authenticity of a comic’s constructed stage persona than, say, a fictional character in a play, attitudes toward comedy grew darker. But the best way to understand this new skepticism about comedy is as a corrective to the wildly romantic and expansive view that has been ascendant for decades but is, historically, an anomaly. A dominant theory of jokes for most of Western civilization, superiority theory, as it’s now called in academia, rests on the idea that laughter has an abusive core, that ridiculing something else makes us feel better about ourselves. This is why Aristotle wondered if certain kinds of jokes (or “jesting” as he called it) should be banned. But starting perhaps with Norman Cousins’s 1979 memoir, “Anatomy of an Illness as Perceived by a Patient,” which described how a steady diet of the Marx Brothers and “Candid Camera” helped cure himself of a possibly fatal disease, a new optimism about humor emerged. Studies about the benefits of comedy proliferated. You can find articles claiming laughter lowers your blood pressure, reduces stress and anxiety, burns calories, boosts your immune system and even diminishes your chance of heart disease and dementia. Comedy has become essential to how we see ourselves. In a 2012 Nielsen study of 2,000 people, 88 percent of millennial men said humor was crucial to their self-definition. We now expect our politicians to be funny on talk shows while critics in the media dedicate resources to scrutinizing comedians for problematic politics. This is in part because the work of comics, once outsiders who plied their trade in dark nightclubs, has taken on the status of prestige art. Next month, after years of development, the first American museum dedicated to comedy opens in Jamestown, N.Y. Its exhibits adopt a mythologizing tone that can also be seen in the recent CNN documentary series, “The History of Comedy,” in which talking heads explain George Carlin’s seven words you can’t say on television the same way teachers examine the causes of the War of 1812. There’s enough reverence for comedy these days that it’s easy to forget that the core of most humor is irreverence. If we think comedy can do everything, won’t we eventually be disappointed? In “Nanette,” Ms. Gadsby explains that the problem of jokes is rooted in their structure — the escalation of tension (the setup) and the inevitable release (the punch line). And she’s right that much of comedy works like this, but not all. She’s far from the first comedian to shut up a crowd by saying something deadly serious. Part of the reason that tactic has worked so well — whether for Billy the Mime or Tig Notaro — is the expectation of the relief of the joke. This can be a limitation, but it can also be an effective tool to better express oneself. Stand-up is not memoir or therapy or a political essay, even if it shares elements with all of these forms. And it cannot solve society’s problems, so in that sense, sure, it’s limited. But that doesn’t mean it’s only good for diverting chuckles. What Ms. Gadsby glosses over is that it’s a nimble art form, one whose conventions can be toyed with or subverted or stuck to rigidly. Like any art, it has its clichés, but it cannot be reduced to a formula. The irony of rigidly defining it now is that there has never been a time in history where the contours of comedy have been more flexible, when there is more disagreement over what exactly it is. In an Instagram story this month, Michael Che seemed to be criticizing (not to mention caricaturing) Ms. Gadsby when he derided comedy that did more than build to punch lines, joking that it should be called “stand-up tragedy.” Others have argued that “Nanette” is not stand-up at all, but theater. The line between solo show and stand-up has always been blurry, but now it is nearly meaningless. The stand-up John Mulaney cites the writer and actor Spalding Gray as an influence, and theaters are filled with stand-ups like Colin Quinn, Neal Brennan and Chris Gethard. Comedy has already co-opted much of the cultural space that was once the province of performance artists and chameleonic solo performers, precisely because it has found room for the ambitious long-form storytelling of Mike Birbiglia, the experimentation of Kate Berlant and Maria Bamford and the political salvos of Sacha Baron Cohen, who at his most provocative builds tension without offering much relief. And while a comedian is not going to single-handedly change the hearts and minds of the American electorate, no other art form has been more effective at changing the public debate. Television show runners didn’t start the conversation about the portrayal of Apu in “The Simpsons” or the history of sexual assault accusations against Bill Cosby. Stand-up comics (Hari Kondabolu, Hannibal Buress) did. And the most discussed work of art this year about the sexist assumptions underpinning our notions of artistic genius did not come from a novel or movie. That was “Nanette,” which in finding articulate expression for a pessimistic critique of stand-up also provides the best case for optimism for the future of the form.",3.0
2106359,Opinion | The Third-Party Option,"National politics needs a leader devoted to redistributing power downward. Opinion Columnist Is there room for a third party? If some independent mounted a presidential bid in 2020, would that person have a chance? Those are questions we won’t be able to answer for a few years. If the Democrats nominate somebody like Mitch Landrieu, the answer is no. Landrieu is a progressive former mayor of New Orleans whose personal style would play well with the white working class and whose convictions and history play well with African-Americans and other groups. A Democrat like Landrieu would occupy all the non-Trump space and make a meaningful third-party run impossible. But suppose the Democrats nominate one of the senators who are now sprinting leftward to catch up with what they perceive to be the Democratic base. In that case, there would be room for a third party. But that bid would not work if it were trying to present a moderate or centrist or pragmatic alternative to the two party ideologies. There is no evidence that there are enough centrists or “pragmatists” to threaten the two-party duopoly. To have a chance, the third-party candidate would have to emerge as the most radical person in the race. That person would have to argue that the Republicans and Democrats are just two sides of a Washington-centric power structure that has ground to a halt. That person would have to promise to radically redistribute power across American society. As Mike Hais, Doug Ross and Morley Winograd argue in their book, “Healing American Democracy,” the current Washington-centric power structure emerged during the New Deal. In those days and for decades after, the country was pretty homogeneous, trust in big institutions was high and the federal government worked more effectively than state and local governments to build a safety net and break up local economic oligarchies. But today, the country is diverse, trust in big institutions is low, the federal government is immobilized by partisanship and debt. Now, state and local governments are more effective across many overlapping domains. It’s no wonder that so many, especially millennials (the most diverse generation of voters in our history), have become disillusioned with federal action. Only 18 percent of Americans say the federal government does the right thing most or nearly all of the time. In July 2016, as Ronald Brownstein has pointed out, only 29 percent of Trump supporters and 23 percent of Clinton supporters thought that electing their candidate would actually lead to progress. In this new context, a third-party candidate might run on what Hais, Ross and Winograd call constitutional localism. The constitutional part means preserving the civil rights safeguards enshrined in the Constitution. The localism part means a radical decentralization of other powers, to the levels of authority people have faith in. All recent presidential candidates have run against Washington, but on the premise that they could change Washington. Today, a third-party candidate would have to run on creating different kinds of power structures at different levels. Part of the solution is devolving power to towns and cities, but as Bruce Katz and Jeremy Nowak write in their book, “The New Localism,” “New Localism is not the same as local government.” Across the country, power is being most effectively wielded by civic councils — organically formed groups of local officials, business leaders, neighborhood organizations. The members may have different racial, class and partisan identities, but they have one shared identity — love of their community. My colleague Thomas Friedman wrote about one such council in Lancaster, Pa. If you want to see others you probably don’t have to travel far — Winston-Salem, Indianapolis, Detroit, Kalamazoo, Denver, Grand Rapids. Power in these places is not just wielded at the ballot box; it is wielded by movements and collaboratives in a thousand ways. According to a 2015 Heartland Monitor poll, 66 percent of Americans believe that their local area is moving in the right direction. These local efforts need a national leader in part because while it’s easy to say, “devolve power,” actually doing it is complicated. For example, civil rights is the area where the national government was once most clearly superior in many parts of the country. But these days, national partisan divisions overlap with our racial divisions, so it’s national demagogues like Donald Trump who most inflame racial animosity to gain political power. Civil rights progress still requires a forceful federal presence to, say, induce local police forces to reform and integrate. But such progress also requires energized local efforts in which people work across racial differences on common loves, like the future of their community’s children. We also need a national leader to tell a different national story. During the 20th century, a superpower story emerged. In that story, the nation moved as one, and a ridiculous amount of attention got focused on the supposed superhero in the White House. A third-party candidate who shifted attention to local people actually getting stuff done might lose, but he or she would begin to define a new and more plausible version of American greatness.

2118460,"John Gagliardi, Winningest College Football Coach, Dies at 91","John Gagliardi, who won more games than any other college football coach with his unconventional methods at a small university in central Minnesota, died on Sunday. He was 91. His death was announced by the university, St. John’s, in Collegeville. It did not say where he died. Gagliardi retired in 2012 after a record 64 seasons as a head coach, 60 of those at St. John’s, an all-male Roman Catholic private university with 2,000 students. He finished with 489 victories, 138 losses and 11 ties, winning four national championships with the Johnnies. But he drew as much national attention for his laid-back approach to the sport. His policy was not to cut any players from the roster and not to hold practices longer than 90 minutes. Gagliardi passed Eddie Robinson of Grambling for the most all-time coaching victories with No. 409 in 2003, and again for the most games coached with No. 588 in 2008. The major-college leader in wins is Joe Paterno, who finished with 409 at Penn State from 1966 to 2011. John Gagliardi was born on Nov. 1, 1926, in Trinidad, Colo., to Ventura and Antonietta Gagliardi. He played football in high school and coached a high school team while getting a degree from Colorado College. At 22 he was hired as head football coach at Carroll College in Montana. Three conference titles in four years changed the college’s mind about dropping the sport. He then moved to St. John’s University, which had been founded in 1857 by Benedictine monks who arrived to minister to the influx of German immigrants to central Minnesota. Though Gagliardi knew little about the college, about 75 miles northwest of Minneapolis, he soon found his niche. In an interview for the job, he was asked if he could beat the rival college St. Thomas, in St. Paul, and another conference foe, Gustavus Adolphus, in St. Peter. “I had never heard of them,” Gagliardi recalled. “But I said, ‘Sure.’ ” St. John’s went 6-2 and won the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in his first season. It was his first of 27 such titles. “When I came to Minnesota I’d never seen television,” Gagliardi said in a 2003 interview with The Associated Press. “I was unmarried at the time, living in the dorms. I asked them if I could have a TV set. They weren’t so sure at first. But after we beat St. Thomas and Gustavus, they were like, ‘You still want that TV?’ ” Saturdays eventually became an event on St. John’s serene, secluded campus as the team thrived under Gagliardi’s leadership. Red-clad fans have routinely packed Clemens Stadium, a natural bowl field carved into the woods, where 7,500 people watch from the seats and more still sit along the grassy slopes. As he built a power at the N.C.A.A.’s nonscholarship Division III level, Gagliardi would shrug off his success with self-deprecating humor. One favorite gag was to pluck a dog-eared book off the shelf in his office and point to the title on the cover: “Everything I Know About Coaching Football for 35 Years.” Inside, every page was blank. Gagliardi was proud of his longevity, openly speaking about outlasting Amos Alonzo Stagg, who was 84 in his last season as the head coach at Pacific University in Oregon in 1946. Stagg’s career lasted a mere 57 years. Gagliardi, who in 2006 became the first active coach to be elected to the College Football Hall of Fame, was not always revered by his peers. Opponents accused his teams of running up the score. In 1991, St. John’s beat Coe College of Iowa, 75-2. The Johnnies started their 2003 championship season with a 74-7 win at Hamline, in St. Paul. Their explanation was that their fourth-stringers were often just as good as some of the opponents’ starters. Gagliardi is survived by his wife, Peg, as well as two daughters, two sons and numerous grandchildren. His coaching philosophy was based on a list of “no’s,” a rejection of football’s sometimes-sadistic rituals that he detested as a player. Gagliardi hated it when people called him “coach,” preferring to be called John. He was terrified of injuries, so contact in practice was kept to a minimum and tackling was prohibited. Everybody who wanted to be on the team could make it, often leaving a roster of more than 150 players. Grueling calisthenics? No way. Same for hazing, screaming, whistles, superstitions and even practicing in extreme conditions. If the mosquitoes were swarming? Forget it. “We have one rule with our players: the golden rule,” Gagliardi said in the 2003 interview. “Treat everybody the way you would want to be treated. We get the right guys. The ones that don’t need any rules. We just hope they can play football.”",3.5

2123321,Know Your Chinese Social Media,"If you want to go viral on social media or gain a mass audience in China, get on Weibo, China’s Twitter and now the country’s most popular microblogging site. INTRODUCED August 2009, by the Chinese technology company Sina Corporation USAGE 430 million active users a month (for comparison, Twitter has about 326 million) CONTENT Official news channels have large followings, but there is little political content that is user-generated because censors quickly remove anything that is deemed sensitive. As a public platform, it’s a launchpad of viral content and the place where online influencers, known as Key Opinion Leaders (K.O.L.s), go to amass a following — and perhaps turn their popularity into brand ambassador roles. Live streaming has become a crucial component of Weibo’s offerings (the platform just acquired its live-streaming partner, Yizhibo) and is a major tool for K.O.L. engagement with their followers. In addition, Weibo Stories, which is similar to Instagram Stories, also allows users to upload short visual content. A STAR Gogoboi, whose real name is Ye Si, has been called China’s most famous fashion K.O.L. He was catapulted to fame when the actress Yao Chen — whose fan base of 80 million is one of the platform’s largest — retweeted a post. Today, he has 9.3 million followers, and Gogoboi’s one-hour backstage live stream of the Victoria’s Secret show on Nov. 8 had been watched 2.5 million times by Nov. 12. If you rolled all your phone apps into one, the result would be close to WeChat. INTRODUCED January 2011 by Tencent, one of China’s top tech companies USAGE With one billion monthly active users, it is the most popular messaging app in China. CONTENT Primarily a messenger app, WeChat can be used to do everything from hailing a cab to booking a hospital appointment — and payments can be made by WeChat Pay. But WeChat is a closed platform and account holders can see only what their friends post, which means brands can interact with subscribers on a personalized level. José Neves, founder of the e-tailer Farfetch, said at The New York Times International Luxury Conference last week in Hong Kong that, for a brand, “the first and foremost platform for your direct presence as a brand in China is WeChat.” The platform’s Mini Programs, third-party “apps” that run in WeChat without requiring downloads, increased to more than one million in 2018, used by brands such as Burberry, H&M, Dior and Longchamp. A STAR Mr. Bags, the 26-year-old Tao Liang, has more than 4.6 million Weibo followers and 870,000 followers on his WeChat public account. He has collaborated with the likes of Montblanc and Givenchy and, in June, introduced a “BaoShop” Mini Program to sell a limited-edition bag created in collaboration with Tod’s. The bag sold out within six minutes and generated 3.24 million renminbi, or $465,615, in sales. The two giants JD and Alibaba dominate e-commerce in China, with more than 80 percent of the market share. INTRODUCED 1998 USAGE 314 million active monthly users CONTENT JD operates the same business model as Amazon, acting as a direct retailer that controls the entire logistical chain of stock and distribution. Twenty percent of its investment comes from the tech giant Tencent, and it was the first e-commerce platform in China to bring same-day delivery to customers. On its website, it says that 90 percent of all purchases are delivered on the day of sale, or the next day. Initially known for quality electronics and housewares, JD introduced its own luxury goods app, called Top Life, in October 2017. Its purchases are delivered by JD’s Luxury Express service, a delivery man wearing a suit and white gloves. A STAR The Swiss watch company Audemars Piguet is one of a host of brands, including Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen, that have signed onto the platform. (The watch company also is selling through its official WeChat store.) The e-commerce site grabbed headlines last week with news of its $30 billion in sales on Singles Day, the Nov. 11 shopping event it created 10 years ago. INTRODUCED 1999 USAGE 552 million active users a month CONTENT Unlike JD.com, Alibaba is an online marketplace for third-party retailers and has no inventory of its own. According to Wang Xiaofeng from Forrester, a market research company, Alibaba’s stake in a host of businesses such as the food delivery app Ele.me allows it to aggregate a huge amount of data across different platforms and offer customized user recommendations. Alibaba’s consumer-to-consumer platforms include Taobao, a vast virtual mall with more than 600 million active monthly users, known as the place to go for cheap and often counterfeit goods. (Many K.O.L.s have opened their own stores on Taobao and live-stream on the site to a majority female audience, half of whom are younger than 25.) It also has Tmall, its business-to-consumer platform, which traditionally leans toward fashion and apparel, and Luxury Pavilion, an invitation-only portal for high-end goods introduced in August 2017. A STAR Burberry, La Mer and Maserati are just some of the brands on the site. Douyin (its international version is known as Tik Tok) is the younger, edgier “new kid” live-streaming site with shareable, snappy video content, as well as memes and GIFs to which users can add music, sound effects and emoticons. INTRODUCED November 2017 USAGE 154 million active users a month CONTENT Many of the K.O.L.s who were propelled into public view just a couple of years ago on live-streaming platforms like YY and Huajia are jumping ship to Douyin. The platform is popular with Generation Z, those younger than 24, but that youthful mass audience hasn’t deterred fashion and luxury brands from creating official accounts. “The young are the ones who dare to spend in China,” said Ms. Wang of Forrester, who attributes Douyin’s success to a truly mobile-led era in which 79 percent of shoppers buy on their cellphone. “Douyin also has powerful machine learning capabilities, which means it continuously pushes content it knows the viewer will like, keeping them hooked.” A STAR Michael Kors was the first international label to debut on the platform. On the Chinese festival that is the equivalent of Valentine’s Day, which was in August this year, Christian Dior introduced the Dioramour bag with five videos, including one from Angelababy, the K.O.L. who is a brand ambassador. In three months, and with 47 video posts, the channel now has more than 208,000 followers. The retail app, which began as a platform for review and discussion of products purchased abroad, says that trust is at the heart of what it promotes. It has become a social network for fashion and beauty products. INTRODUCED 2014 USAGE 30 million active users a month CONTENT A 2017 report by Bain showed that Chinese shoppers made three-quarters of their luxury purchases overseas, often through the diagou system, in which travelers and students buy luxury or hard-to-get items abroad and then sell them at a profit to people at home. (Diagou means “buy on behalf of.”) Beijing recently has been trying to change the practice by easing import taxes, cracking down on travelers at customs entry points and supporting sales via large e-commerce platforms, as well as smaller sites like Little Red Book. The platform, which recently secured $300 million from investors including Alibaba, has A-list K.O.L.s, including Fan Bingbing, who debuted an account in January and, despite her recent tax problems, has more than 10 million fans.

2127912,Lonzo Ball Strives to Be a Point Guard Fit for a King,"OAKLAND, Calif. — Lonzo Ball began to revere LeBron James when James was a first-year forward with the Cleveland Cavaliers, which would have made Ball about 6 years old at the time. But Ball, as he put it himself in an interview last week, “idolized” James so much, even then, that he had a youth-size replica of one of his jerseys. All these years later, Ball belongs to the cast of characters — otherwise known as the Los Angeles Lakers — who work alongside James and labor for victories in his mammoth shadow. It still feels a little surreal to Ball, who sits not far from James in the home locker room at Staples Center and absorbs all he can. “I’ve looked up to him my whole life,” Ball said. Ball, of course, is no stranger to the spotlight, which has followed him around — often at his father’s invitation — since he was a McDonald’s All-American at Chino Hills High School, about 35 miles east of Los Angeles. It shined on him last season, too, for better but mostly for worse, as he struggled with injuries and growing pains as a first-year point guard in the N.B.A. But the addition of James this season has brought its own brand of pressure, and it was mounting on Ball, 21, ahead of the Lakers’ annual Christmas Day game, this one a 127-101 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night. He was coming off one of his lumpiest games of the season, a 107-99 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday in which he collected all of 4 points, 3 rebounds and 2 assists while shooting just 2 of 10 from the field. He missed all seven of his 3-point attempts. Lakers Coach Luke Walton thought that Ball had let his shooting woes, which are nothing particularly new, affect the rest of his game. “He’s too good of a player, and he’s too important to us, to let that happen,” Walton said. Ball, though, has been just as capable of offsetting his clunkers with solid efforts that would appear to validate the Lakers’ investment in him as the No. 2 pick in the 2017 draft. He is as tantalizing as he is maddening. He had, for example, a couple of memorable games this month, starting with the third triple-double of his career — 16 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists — in a blowout win against the Charlotte Hornets. James, who also finished that game with a triple-double (his 75th), later used his Instagram account to post a photo of himself embracing Ball. “We’re one and the same when it comes to our playmaking ability,” James told reporters after the game. Three days later, Ball scored 23 points while shooting 9 of 16 from the field and 5 of 9 from 3-point range in a loss to the Brooklyn Nets. Taken together (and ignoring the microscopic sample size for now), those performances seemed to support the notion that he could be a worthy point guard to pair with James. Ball is an exceptional passer, the product of court vision reminiscent of a certain Lakers great who is now the team’s president of basketball operations. But Ball continues to struggle with consistency and his jump shot. Entering Tuesday’s game, he was averaging 9 points, 5.2 rebounds and 4.8 assists a game while shooting 39.7 percent from the field and 30.9 percent from 3-point range. (Against the Warriors, he had 6 points, 3 rebounds and 4 assists over 24 minutes.) And so, the questions trail him: Can he put it all together? And if so, can he do it quickly enough to match the accelerated timeline James’s addition has created for the Lakers? “Everybody’s watching him,” Ball said of James, “and expecting him to pretty much bring us a championship and all these great things. But he needs a supporting cast.” For his part, Ball has maintained an extraordinary level of confidence. “Obviously, I want to be an All-Star,” he said. “I want to be M.V.P. one day. But for me, it’s all about championships. When I play the game, I play to win.” And Ball, who spent one year at U.C.L.A. before turning pro, said he understands the stakes, too: “I’m from here, so I know how it is playing in L.A. If you’re winning, they love you. If not, they’ll find someone else to do the job.” Ball is wired differently. He said that criticism fuels him because he likes proving people wrong. (In the modern parlance of the game, these people might be described as “haters.”) When Rajon Rondo, the veteran point guard, started trash-talking him at practice earlier this season, Ball encouraged him to keep doing it — not that Rondo needed to be told twice. “It gets me going,” Ball said. “I grew up with my dad coaching me, yelling at me. So people talking trash — that’s how I’ve played my whole life.” Ah, yes — his father. It is worth noting that LaVar Ball has been much less of a vocal presence this season. Lonzo has a younger brother, LaMelo, who is playing high school basketball for a private academy in Ohio, and LaVar has been spending most of his time with him. He has only occasionally criticized Walton this season. “I think he’s just focused on my little brother,” Lonzo Ball said. “I’m doing what I’m supposed to do, and he can’t really take me any further with basketball. I got to the league, and that was that. I accomplished what I wanted to do, and now the rest is on me.” After undergoing knee surgery over the summer, Ball has had to work himself into playing shape through the early weeks of the season, and he might not be there yet. It is difficult to know just how much room he has for growth. “It was tough because I thought it was going to be a big summer for me,” Ball said. “I had potential my first year, but I felt like I could’ve done a lot better, and I was going to use the summer to tune everything up. But I couldn’t do anything.” Well, he could do three things: eat, watch film and lift weights. He added about 20 pounds of muscle to his upper body — he has been listed at 6 feet 6 inches and 190 pounds — which was a silver lining to an otherwise bleak off-season. “I think he really enjoyed the process of getting bigger and stronger,” the assistant coach Miles Simon said. “You could tell, because he was always walking around without a shirt on.” The added bulk has made Ball better on defense this season, Simon said, which is an underrated part of his game. But not having a full, healthy summer was a setback. “In the N.B.A., there’s a lot of stuff you can do in the off-season where you really get better,” Miles said, “and he hasn’t had that yet.” Still, the Lakers, who were 19-14 going into the Warriors game, are not necessarily in the long-term growth business, not when James is about to turn 34, in the thick of his prime, and wants to vie for championships soon-ish. Look no further than his comments last week about how much he would love to play with the likes of Anthony Davis, the New Orleans Pelicans’ All-Star center. As for Ball, James has been supportive of him, full of praise for the young guard in his interactions with the news media and on social media — and that means something, for now. “LeBron’s one of the best players ever to play the game, so I don’t think he’d lie just because I’m his teammate,” Ball said. “I think he really sees something in me.”",4.5
2129333,Trump Prepares to Unveil a Vast Reworking of Clean Water Protections,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter. WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is expected on Tuesday to unveil a plan that would weaken federal clean water rules designed to protect millions of acres of wetlands and thousands of miles of streams nationwide from pesticide runoff and other pollutants. Environmentalists say the proposal represents a historic assault on wetlands regulation at a moment when Mr. Trump has repeatedly voiced a commitment to “crystal-clean water.” The proposed new rule would chip away at safeguards put in place a quarter century ago, during the administration of President George H.W. Bush, who implemented a policy designed to ensure that no wetlands lost federal protection. “They’re definitely rolling things back to the pre-George H.W. Bush era,” said Blan Holman, who works on water regulations with the Southern Environmental Law Center. Wetlands play key roles in filtering surface water and protecting against floods, while also providing wildlife habitat. President Trump, who made a pledge of weakening a 2015 Obama-era rule one of his central campaign pledges, is expected to tout his plan as ending a federal land grab that impinged on the rights of farmers, rural landowners and real estate developers to use their property as they see fit. Under the Obama rule, farmers using land near streams and wetlands were restricted from doing certain kinds of plowing and planting certain crops, and would have been required to apply for permits from the Environmental Protection Agency in order to use chemical pesticides and fertilizers that could have run off into those water bodies. Under the new Trump plan, which lifts federal protections from many of those streams and wetlands, those requirements will also be lifted. A spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency, John Konkus, declined to comment on the plan. The clean water rollback is the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration to weaken or undo major environmental rules, including proposals to weaken regulations on planet-warming emissions from cars, power plants and oil and gas drilling rigs, a series of moves designed to speed new drilling in the vast Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and efforts to weaken protections under the Endangered Species Act. This week in Katowice, Poland, at an annual United Nations conference on mitigating global warming, Trump administration officials held an event touting the benefits of fossil fuels. The proposed water rule, scheduled to be announced Tuesday morning at the Environmental Protection Agency, is designed to replace an Obama-era regulation known as Waters of the United States. Tuesday’s unveiling of the proposal is expected to coincide with its publication in the federal register. After that, the administration will take comment on the plan for 60 days, and it could then revise the plan before finalizing it next year. The Obama rule, developed jointly by the E.P.A. and the Army Corps of Engineers under the authority of the 1972 Clean Water Act, was designed to limit pollution in about 60 percent of the nation’s bodies of water, protecting sources of drinking water for about a third of the United States. It extended existing federal authority to limit pollution in large bodies of water, like the Chesapeake Bay and Puget Sound, to smaller bodies that drain into them, such as tributaries, streams and wetlands. But it became a target for rural landowners, an important part of President Trump’s political base, since it could have restricted how much pollution from chemical fertilizers and pesticides could seep into water on their property. The new Trump water rule will retain federal protections for those larger bodies of water, the rivers that drain into them, and wetlands that are directly adjacent to those bodies of water, according to a detailed eight-page fact sheet prepared by the administration ahead of the unveiling of the rule and reviewed by The New York Times. But it will strip away protections of so-called “ephemeral” streams, in which water runs only during or after rainfalls, and of wetlands that are not adjacent to major bodies of water, or connected to such bodies of water by a surface channel of water. Those changes represent a victory for farmers and rural landowners, who lobbied the Trump administration aggressively to make them. “The Obama administration led with the premise that all water is connected, all water runs downhill, and the federal government could control all water,” said Don Parrish, director of regulatory relations with the American Farm Bureau Federation, who met with White House officials over the summer to press the case for those changes. “If they can control the water that falls out of the sky, they control the land that it falls on,” he said. Mr. Parrish also said the Obama rule chafed its detractors because of the perception it was written by bureaucrats who did not understand the daily reality of farmers’ livelihoods. “The last administration called our concerns silly and ludicrous, and this administration took us seriously. They listened to us,” he said. In particular, he cited a social media campaign run by the Obama administration, “Ditch the myth,” which challenged the claim that the rule would have regulated water in ditches. “With that campaign, they were laughing at us,” he said. Mr. Trump won cheers from rural audiences on the presidential campaign trail when he vowed to roll back the Obama rule. Real estate developers and golf course owners (industries in which Mr. Trump worked for decades) were also among the chief opponents of the earlier rule. One of Mr. Trump’s first actions in office was to sign an executive order directing his E.P.A. chief to repeal and replace the rule. To environmentalists, however, the proposed rule change “upends the core mission of the E.P.A., which is to protect human health and the environment,” said Bart Johnsen-Harris, who works on water policy at the Environment America, an advocacy group. While the Obama rule would have applied federal protections to wetlands that are not adjacent to major bodies of water, or do not directly drain into them via a surface water channel, the new rule will strip away that protection. That potentially opens millions of acres of pristine wetlands to more pollution, according to Mr. Holman of the Southern Environmental Law Center. “For wetlands, this is an absolute disaster, compared to the Obama plan,” he said. While such wetlands may not be physically next to major bodies of water, they can still drain into such larger bodies through underground networks, Mr. Holman said. Stripping away those protections would still allow pollution to seep into the nation’s broader waterways, he said. It would also make it easier for developers to pave over such wetlands. Federal courts had already halted the implementation of the 2015 Obama-era rules in 28 states after opponents sued to block them. However, in recent months the rules had taken effect in the other 22 states. The wetland protection policies put in place decades ago by the first President Bush, an avid fisherman, followed on his own campaign pledge to save wetlands, saying, “all wetlands, no matter how small, should be preserved,” and proposing a “no net loss” policy. That initial policy was later weakened by Mr. Bush’s own E.P.A., but environmentalists have credited him for elevating the issue. Fifteen years later, the second President Bush gave regulatory teeth to his father’s proposal, implementing an E.P.A. rule requiring stronger wetlands protection that his father had once envisioned.

2131216,Explaining Trump’s Tweet on Crimes by Immigrants,"Fact-Check President Trump cited an array of statistics to paint a portrait of widespread criminal conduct by undocumented immigrants. Here’s the context behind them. What WAS Said Twenty-two days into the longest government shutdown ever, President Trump continued to press his case for a border wall. His tweet on Saturday was crammed with statistics that were either exaggerated or omitted important context. Immigrant prison population Mr. Trump’s figure for the percentage of unauthorized immigrants in federal prisons is exaggerated. Out of the Bureau of Prisons’ total inmate population of 183,058 in the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year, 21 percent were immigrants, both legal and undocumented, according to a government report. At least 13 percent of the total population, or 23,826 inmates, were in the country unlawfully. The immigration status of another 11,698 inmates was under investigation, while 2,608 inmates were lawful immigrants or had received relief from deportation. The most common crimes committed by these immigrants were drug-related offenses (46 percent) and immigration offenses (29 percent). It’s worth noting, too, that about half of the arrests made by the federal government are for immigration-related offenses, perhaps explaining the high proportion of immigrants in federal prisons. The report acknowledges that it does not include data from state and local prisons, which house 90 percent of all inmates in the United States. Border arrests Mr. Trump did not give a time frame for his 240 percent figure, nor did he specify what the number referred to, which may give the misleading impression that border crossings overall have increased threefold. The figure instead refers to a surge in families attempting to cross at the southwest border. The number of family units apprehended at the border more than tripled from 8,120 in December 2017 to 27,518 in December 2018, overwhelming immigration officials and creating a new humanitarian crisis. Overall, illegal border crossings have been declining for nearly two decades, and in the 2017 fiscal year, border crossing apprehensions were at their lowest point since 1971. In the 2018 fiscal year, however, annual apprehensions did increase by 30 percent from the previous fiscal year. Immigrant criminals in Texas Mr. Trump’s figures are accurate, but they need context. The Texas Department of Public Safety did report that the 186,000 unauthorized immigrants booked into local jails from 2011 to 2018 faced 292,000 charges. The caveats: These offenses did not necessarily occur during that eight-year time frame. More than half of these charges were uncategorized. And the charges Mr. Trump singled out did not always result in convictions (238 for homicide, 13,559 for assault, 1,689 for sexual assault and 1,280 for weapons). For comparison, data from the Texas Department of Public Safety shows that some 7.5 million arrests were made from 2010 to 2017 (data for 2018 was not yet available), including 6,161 for murder, 177,000 for aggravated assault, 14,000 for rape and nearly 89,000 for weapons charges. A 2018 study from the libertarian Cato Institute found that in Texas, conviction and arrest rates for illegal immigrants were lower than those for native-born Americans for most crimes. An earlier version of this article misstated the data included in a government report on immigrants in prison. The report does not include data from state and local prisons.",4.5
2133148,Stories We’re Watching Across the Indo-Pacific,"Letter 90 The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau chief. Sign up to get it by email. ___ I’m in Hong Kong this week for our annual meeting with New York Times editors and correspondents from all across Asia, and on the plane over I was reading Evan Osnos’s book, “Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China.” It’s a fascinating read, far more about people than geopolitics (read our 2014 review), making it a strong introduction to some of the themes that many of us will continue to inquire about as the world grapples with China’s growing impact. Some of the questions are almost existential: Has China proved that centralized authoritarianism works better for economic growth than decentralized democracy? Others are more particular: How is China using technology to maintain and expand its power? How will China respond to the growing backlash to its policies forming in Australia, the United States and elsewhere? These reporting targets, we hope, will yield interesting journalism throughout the year. But our discussions in Hong Kong also covered the region. We have correspondents throughout Asia, reporting on politics, culture, business and technology; here are a few of the topics that led to robust conversations about our future coverage. This is far from a comprehensive list, but consider it a bit of a preview for 2019. Elections: India, the Philippines, Thailand — and Australia of course — all have elections scheduled for this year. Voters will be given stark choices about not just domestic policy, but also foreign affairs. Demographics: India has to create a million jobs each year to keep unemployment from rising; Japan is desperate for workers; China is desperate for babies. There are also intriguing stories about South Korea’s aging populace, Australia’s immigration debate and China’s broader population dynamics — especially its overabundance of men. Women: The role of women in the work force and in life, in Japan, in China, in Australia — these were all of interest to the group. What are the structures that maintain the status quo, how do they differ from country to country, and to what extent are they changing? Trump’s world: Ah, the Americans — what an unpredictable lot! What many of us in the Indo-Pacific wanted to know is what the broader shift toward “America first” means for the world. To what extent will the American relationship with South Korea and North Korea change? To what extent will the United States-China trade war undermine the global economy or create new relationships and alliances? These are just a few of the subjects you’ll see explored in The New York Times this year — and of course, in this newsletter, which aims to add a bit of perspective on Australia and the topics Australians care about. Sign up to get it in your inbox each week if you haven’t already, and join us in our NYT Australia Facebook group for additional discussion. Now here are a few of the stories that stood out for me this week, from Australia, Vanuatu and beyond. ___ “A faint aura of destiny seems to hover over Teouma Bay,” writes Gideon Lewis-Kraus, in this ambitious magazine story told from Vanuatu about old bones that have led to sweeping claims about human history and settlement throughout the Pacific. Gideon brilliantly explains both the controversial science that’s transforming archaeology — and the risks that come from the perception of scientific certainty about ancient history. If you read just one long story this week, read this one. For those seeking a shorter way in, here are 5 takeaways from his report. ___ Following Brexit’s ups and downs can be exhausting. For context, read this news analysis piece that explains how the Brexit fiasco “seems to be forcing a tectonic shift in how Britain is governed, as Parliament flexes its muscles and the prime minister struggles to force through her agenda — a dynamic more characteristic of America’s gridlock-prone system.” You might also want to check out our graphic on what happens next (or at least what might happen next; certaintly eludes us all). ___ Sometimes global failure can be so... visually stunning. Seriously. Check out this stunning exploration of the world’s disappearing glaciers. They cover about 200,000 square miles of the earth’s surface and over the last four decades they’ve lost the equivalent of a layer of ice 70 feet thick. This great global melting contributes to sea level rise. It affects production of hydroelectricity. It leads to disasters like rapid, catastrophic floods and debris flows. It alters rivers and ecosystems, affecting the organisms that inhabit them. ___ We have several reporters at the Australian Open. You can follow day-to-day coverage on our tennis page, but for a few more thoughtful reads, don’t miss these features: • Serena Williams Is Back at Australian Open, for Tennis and So Much More • A Male Tennis Pro, a Female Coach and Shrugs for Anyone Who Thinks It Won’t Work • John Isner (One of the Tallest Players in Tennis) Is Always Looking for Extra Leg Room • 2019 Australian Open: Players to Watch ___ It’s not just tennis; we have a few other bits of summer fun to share as well: • With Beaches, Wine and Buzz, Is This Australia’s Next Hot Place? The remote Margaret River region has beauty, vineyards and an annual food and wine festival called the Gourmet Escape that is increasingly putting it on the map. • The Best Restaurants in Melbourne’s Little Italy Are on Opposite Sides of the Street: Besha Rodella contemplates the value and mystery of The Olive Jar and Capitano. • An Australian Brings Americana to His New York Bar: Peppi’s Cellar is the first bar in the city from Jason Scott, whose enthusiasm for the United States shows in his Sydney bars. • A Movie Star With a ‘Weird Relationship With Confidence:’ The Australian actor and director Joel Edgerton has carved his own path through Hollywood, with the help of a band of filmmaking brothers. • The Gay Penguins of Australia: Two male penguins are raising a baby whose gender is unknown. ___ Tiny Love Stories, a new column from the New York Times Styles section, features reader-submitted “miniature Modern Love essays” of no more than 100 words.

2135593,Everything Evens Out in the End,"DAILY CROSSWORD COLUMN Erik Agard brings us together by splitting us up. SUNDAY PUZZLE — Today’s Erik Agard grid has a little trick, one of those breezy ones that you figure out and start thinking, “Oh, I bet I could come up with dozens of these” (you probably can’t). There’s a Will Shortz introduction to the Sunday grid in print now, for anyone who doesn’t read the paper Sunday Magazine, and apparently Mr. Agard does a Sunday puzzle in around five minutes. I felt as if I sped through this puzzle, although I came nowhere near that blazing speed (I definitely can’t). If you understand the trick early in your solve, you’ll probably feel the same. If you didn’t, never fear! It’s not easy, it’s clever, and it’s one of those that sneaks up on you like a really well-balanced spicy bowl of chili. There is a bit of a commonality between today’s grid and today’s variety puzzle, so if you liked this one and still have some big puzzle energy try the one called “Meshing Around.” It is certainly a coincidence and I will avoid apophenia but just say it is available on the crossword page, in case you aren’t in the habit of finding and solving our additional Sunday offerings. Obviously we are going to see some very cool cluing today, given our constructor. I loved YESSIR, SPA, LIES, TSK, SCREW and others. I had “book” for GEAR because I don’t use a backpack, I am of average height and I look like a tortoise with one. Back in college I once took a backpack on a weekend trip with the Collected Chaucer in it and nothing else. I also drew a blank on some names, including AMECHE (because of how it was clued, I insist), SERT, DARLA and CELIE, who was played by Whoopi Goldberg but was still a toughie to me. 29A: At first I glossed over this clue because I’m no chess expert, but I learned that this move, en PASSANT, is quite unusual and sneaky, and involves only pawns, which is really nice because pawns don’t get much glory, do they. PASSANT is also a heraldic term, referring to that peculiar stance you sometimes see lions or dragons taking, on shields and crests and such, where one paw is raised dramatically in pre-pounce. Cool how this clue crosses over SPARES, another sports reference. 132A: This actress is also a rapper, and she’s from Queens! Look her up — AWKWAFINA. She’s a lot of fun and was just in the news this week for something earth-shattering — she’s the first public figure to have an orchid named after her by the New York Botanical Garden. This is the kind of service journalism I am proud to bring you. 29D: This clue — “Oink-filled pen” — seems as if it could be a sign that a whimsical farmer could buy on etsy.com to put above a PIGSTY. One where the pigs wear sweaters when it’s cold out and get artisanal plant-based slop. Also fabulous how this nearly ran into INK at 72D. 32D: Think military time — this is TWO PM. 73D: This is one you either know or you don’t know, I’m pretty sure, and it is a debut. Manga is a huge pop culture niche and SAILOR MOON is a major franchise, but a person can absorb only so much entertainment. 97D: Think mama birds, or some Hollywood actresses, who PRECHEW everything their precious progeny ingest. O.K., so I don’t know what made me start at the bottom of this puzzle (I have such a thing for Awkwafina, my brain must have made a beeline to her) — but if you get the clue to the explainer for the theme, at 121A, then the trick is self-explanatory. Still fun, though. There are seven theme entries, indicated by italic clues at 21, 40, 59, 64, 72, 84 and 99 Across. The clues solve to two-part entries, none of which are particularly obvious: I think I was about a third through the entire grid before I finished my first theme entry. That was 84A, “Allen Ginsberg, e.g.,” which solved to PROTEST POET. Sounds right to me, but it is anyone’s guess, given just that example, what Mr. Agard is getting at. A bit above this one at 64A, “Posting that is blowing in the wind” made me think of Bob Dylan and vaguely entertain the notion of a “freewheelin’” theme today, something that I would kind of love, and the answer here — SWINGING SIGN — did sort of fit the vibe, a little, sort of. Then I finished the northwest corner, and with it the slightly city-slicker-snob clue at 21A, “Likely inexpensive place to get one’s hair done,” SMALL TOWN SALON. This was possibly the most stilted of the very smooth theme entries, and it did prompt an attempt to parse just what was going on here. You might notice that in each of these examples there is a preponderance of the same letters; in fact, every letter in the last part of each theme entry is included in the first part of the theme entry. In fact, every letter in the last part appears, in order, in every other letter position of the first part of the entry. Like so: PROTEST POET. Or SWINGING SIGN. Or, say it with me, SMALL TOWN SALON. And that’s the pattern. My favorite, I think, was 40A, REINDEER RIDE. I have a mental image of reindeer from their participation in the opening ceremony of the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics. They’re not that big, are they? I feel a reindeer might come to about midthigh on Erik Agard. So I’m going to say that what’s meant here is a sleigh ride in the silence of the Finnmark landscape. That revealer, at 121A? “How lucky was that?” If you’ve ever almost been hit by a piano falling out a window or won the lottery, then you know this expression. Oh, also, the letters in the first part of the theme answer, which form the second part of each theme answer, are in the 1, 3, 5, 7 position and so on. WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

2136963,Pelosi Begins Drive to Block Trump’s Emergency Declaration,"WASHINGTON — Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday began her push to overturn President Trump’s emergency declaration, scheduling a House vote for Tuesday on legislation that would end the declaration, a timeline meant to force congressional Republicans to choose quickly between their president and the prerogatives of their branch of government. With little doubt that Ms. Pelosi can muster the House votes to block the declaration, her goal is to raise pressure on Republicans to defend the power granted to Congress by the Constitution to control federal spending. Democrats will need to pick up a handful of Senate Republicans to pass the resolution of disapproval, which is a possibility. That would force Mr. Trump to issue the first veto of his presidency, an action he said on Friday was “100 percent” certain. From there, supporters would need the votes of two-thirds of Congress to override that veto, a much taller order. But the resolution will force Republicans in both chambers to make a stark choice, and defections are all but definite. Democrats are appealing to conservatives to join them in defending what Ms. Pelosi called Congress’s “exclusive power of the purse.” “This issue transcends partisan politics,” Ms. Pelosi told reporters in a phone call on Friday, adding, “It’s about patriotism.” Mr. Trump, with his declaration, hopes to divert $3.6 billion from military construction projects to build his promised wall along the southwestern border, effectively going around Congress to secure money that lawmakers have repeatedly refused to give him. Multiple lawsuits have already been filed to have the maneuver declared unconstitutional, but the simplest way to block it is for Congress to overturn the declaration through mechanisms set up by the National Emergencies Act of 1976. “We prepared for the worst, because the president right now is engaged in the worst,” said Ms. Pelosi, speaking from Laredo, Tex., where she said she planned to tour the southwestern border with other lawmakers. She declined to say if the House would formally support any legal action in court, but said that lawmakers were still considering additional legal steps. “The president’s act is lawless — it does violence to our Constitution and therefore our democracy,” Ms. Pelosi said. Republican leaders promised to muster enough votes in the House to sustain Mr. Trump’s veto. “Declaring a national emergency is a sobering act, which is why Congress enacted a statute governing when and how the president can take this action,” said Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee. “House Democrats’ angst over Congress’s power of the purse is unwarranted, especially since the commander in chief’s authority to redirect military funds for a national emergency is affirmed in a law passed by their own branch.” But Republicans will not stop the measure on Tuesday. More than 220 Democrats and one Republican — Representative Justin Amash of Michigan — have signed on to the resolution of disapproval, which Congress can use to end the emergency status under the National Emergencies Act if the threat has dissolved or if there is concern that the president has used his powers irresponsibly. That is already more than enough to clear the House. Ms. Pelosi noted that extending an offer to Republicans to join Democrats in sponsoring the resolution was a courtesy. “What’s really important is how they will vote when it comes to the floor,” she said. “We’ll see where they come down on that.” Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas and the author of the resolution, said that he planned to spend the weekend calling his colleagues and rallying support for the measure. He said he and his staff had been working on the one-page measure for weeks in anticipation of a declaration. “This is an historic power grab and it will require historic unity by members of Congress,” he said on Friday, calling the declaration a “parasitic movement” from the president. “If the Congress rolls over on this, the president is likely to do it again,” he added. By law, the Senate will have to take up the measure within 18 days of its passage in the House, where a floor vote is expected within 18 days after a committee vote. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has in the past been a fierce defender of Senate prerogative, but he backed Mr. Trump’s declaration this month to secure passage of a major spending bill that funds the government through the fiscal year. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement on Thursday that identical companion legislation would soon be introduced in the Senate. The Senate could also move to amend the resolution that is expected to pass through the House. House Republicans argue that legal authority given to the president under the act allows for the declaration, and that there should be support for prioritizing border security. But for several Republicans, there is concern about the murky circumstances for declaring a national emergency and the precedent that Mr. Trump’s declaration will set for future administrations. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and one of the senators likely to rebuff the president, said this week that she would support a resolution as long as it did not contain additional items. Other Senate Republicans have voiced discomfort with the president’s decision but have yet to publicly say whether they will support the resolution of disapproval. The slim Republican majority offers hope for Democrats that four Republicans will join them in passing the resolution through the Senate. The challenging 2020 re-election campaigns will squeeze some Senate Republicans between the pro-wall demands of Mr. Trump’s base and more moderate voters who oppose the wall or Mr. Trump’s emergency declaration. Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, outlined situations last week that “a left-wing president would undoubtedly utilize to implement their radical policy agenda while bypassing the authority of Congress” — a “rabbit hole” that he said Mr. Trump’s move had made possible. Others stood by the president “I know some Republicans are concerned about the precedent it will set, but here’s what I’m concerned about: a broken border,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, speaking on Fox News. “I’m worried about what is going to happen now, not what some Democrat may do later.” Both Democratic leaders said Mr. Trump’s declaration violated one of the clearest constitutional mandates. “If the president’s emergency declaration prevails, it will fundamentally change the balance of powers in a way our country’s founders never envisioned,” Mr. Schumer said Thursday. “That should be a serious wake-up call to senators in both parties who believe in the constitutional responsibility of Congress to limit an overreaching executive.” Members of the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on Thursday in part to examine Mr. Trump’s use of powers under the National Emergencies Act. Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the committee chairman, has requested that Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, and other Justice Department officials appear as witnesses.",5.0
2141158,Paul Manafort’s Prison Sentence Is Nearly Doubled to 7½ Years,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Wednesday nearly doubled the prison sentence of President Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, to seven and a half years, denouncing him as a man who “spent a significant portion of his career gaming the system.” Minutes later, the Manhattan district attorney filed a raft of state criminal charges, including mortgage fraud, that could ensure that Mr. Manafort remains behind bars even if the president decides — as he has appeared to hint — to pardon Mr. Manafort for his crimes. Convictions for state crimes are not subject to federal pardons. The proceedings amounted to a wrenching defeat for Mr. Manafort, 69, who came to his sentencing in a wheelchair because of gout and pleading for probation so he could spend his final years with his wife. Judge Amy Berman Jackson of United States District Court in Washington expressed scant sympathy for his plight. Rather, she closed out the highest-profile prosecution brought by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, with a blistering critique of Mr. Manafort’s character and a rapid-fire litany of his legal and ethical transgressions. She said that Mr. Manafort had used his many talents as a strategist to evade taxes, deceive banks, subvert lobbying laws and obstruct justice — all so he could sustain an “ostentatiously opulent” lifestyle with “more houses than a family can enjoy, more suits than one man can wear.” Ever since his initial bail hearing, she said, he had misled her and the prosecutors, part of what she called his determined efforts to obscure the facts. Even on his sentencing day, she implied, he appeared to be making a play for a presidential pardon by wrongly suggesting that he was merely the victim of overzealous prosecutors who had hoped to prove that the Trump campaign had conspired with the Russian government to tilt the 2016 election. “The defendant is not public enemy No. 1, but he is also not a victim either,” Judge Jackson said. She stopped short of giving Mr. Manafort the maximum 10-year term that she could have imposed, adding three and a half years to the nearly four-year term Mr. Manafort received last week in a related prosecution in Alexandria, Va. Explaining why she was not harsher, she cited guidelines intended to limit punishment in overlapping cases and the fact that Mr. Manafort’s effort to tamper with witnesses who could testify against him had been “nipped in the bud.” Her attitude stood in stark contrast to that of Judge T. S. Ellis III of United States District Court in Northern Virginia, who said last week that Mr. Manafort had “led an otherwise blameless life” in sentencing him to 47 months for eight felonies, a punishment that some legal experts described as startlingly low. In an apparent reference to Judge Ellis, Judge Jackson noted that she was bound strictly by the case in front of her. “What is happening today is not and cannot be a review and a revision by a sentence imposed by another court,” she said. But she said the scale of Mr. Manafort’s crimes was remarkable. “It is hard to overstate the number of lies and the amount of fraud and the amount of money involved,” she said. “There is no question that this defendant knew better and he knew what he was doing.” Outside the courthouse, Mr. Manafort’s lead lawyer, Kevin Downing, described Judge Jackson’s decision as “such a callous, harsh sentence that is totally unnecessary.” Mr. Downing, who was repeatedly interrupted by protesters, called it a “very sad day.” Mr. Manafort’s defense lawyers had repeatedly suggested that their client would be a free man had he not worked for the Trump campaign for five months in 2016, implying that Mr. Mueller’s investigators pursued him for crimes unrelated to the campaign only because they hoped to use him as a steppingstone in the Russia inquiry. Judge Jackson firmly dismissed that argument, noting that investigators often find evidence of unrelated crimes during inquiries, and that “the perpetrators uncovered that way do not get a pass.” She said the argument was aimed at “some other audience,” an apparent allusion to the White House, not at her. The judge accused Mr. Manafort of a sleight of hand throughout the criminal proceeding against him, including wrongly inflating his assets in a bail hearing and exaggerating the harshness of his conditions in jail. She suggested that he had sought to outmaneuver prosecutors by agreeing to plead guilty to conspiracy and cooperate with them, then backtracking and lying to the special counsel’s office and a grand jury. “Was he spinning the facts beforehand to get a good deal, or was he spinning them afterwards to protect others?” she asked. “We don’t know.” Six Trump advisers or officials have been charged by the special counsel. Even Mr. Manafort’s apology for his crimes rang somewhat hollow, she said, because it appeared to be prompted by Judge Ellis’s criticism that he did not seem sufficiently contrite during last week’s sentencing. Each of the conspiracy charges considered at Wednesday’s hearing carried a maximum prison term of five years. But because the underlying conduct for one conspiracy count was much the same as the bank and tax fraud scheme for which Mr. Manafort was convicted in Northern Virginia, Judge Jackson cut his punishment for that charge in half, to 30 months. “He cannot be sentenced for those components twice,” she said. She sentenced him to 13 months on the second conspiracy charge, which involved obstruction of justice, saying his efforts to influence the testimony of witnesses had largely come to naught because the witnesses had rebuffed him. In requesting probation, Mr. Manafort noted that he would turn 70 in two weeks and had already been stripped of his wealth. “Please let my wife and I be together,” he said. “I am a different person than the one who came before you in October 2017,” when he was first indicted. Much of the hearing in Washington focused on Mr. Manafort’s violations of the law requiring foreign lobbyists to disclose their activities in the United States — probably because the other charges had been aired at length in the Virginia case. Andrew Weissmann, the lead prosecutor, said Mr. Manafort and others, at his behest, secretly lobbied for the government of Viktor F. Yanukovych, the pro-Russian president who led Ukraine from 2010 to 2014. Former European politicians and other members of Mr. Manafort’s team presented themselves as independent experts, disguising their true client. “This deliberate effort to obscure the facts undermines our political discourse,” Judge Jackson said. [Read how Mr. Manafort’s sentence compares to other white-collar criminals.] Judge Jackson tends to be relatively lenient on convicted criminals who appear before her. In the five years that ended in 2017, she handed down an average prison sentence of 32 months, below the Washington district’s average of 46 months and the nationwide average of 47 months, according to court data maintained by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. But she also has gone out of her way to make clear that being well connected earns no chits in her court. “She knows who commits white-collar crime,” said Heather Shaner, a Washington lawyer who represented an embezzler in her court. “And she thinks it’s perfectly fine to punish them if they commit a crime and hold them to a higher standard because they have the education, and because they have the wealth.” The prospect that Mr. Trump could pardon Mr. Manafort has hung over the proceedings for many months. Late last year, Mr. Trump said that he “wouldn’t take it off the table.” More recently, he said, “I don’t even discuss it.” Asked again after Wednesday’s sentencing, Mr. Trump said: “I have not even given it a thought, as of this moment. It’s not something that’s right now on my mind.” He added, “I feel very badly for Paul Manafort,” saying “certainly, on a human basis, it’s a very sad thing.” He said again that the special counsel’s investigation was “a hoax.” In remarks that appeared aimed at the president, Mr. Downing said outside the courthouse that “two courts have ruled no evidence of any collusion with the Russians.” In fact, Judge Jackson and Judge Ellis simply noted that the evidence against Mr. Manafort was not related to Russia’s election meddling. The new charges filed in New York, in an indictment secured by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., were apparently meant to ensure that Mr. Manafort would be punished even if he was pardoned. They were rooted in the same financial fraud that led to Mr. Manafort’s downfall in federal courthouses. He is charged with falsifying business records to obtain millions of dollars in loans from two banks. “No one is beyond the law in New York,” Mr. Vance said. He said his investigation had “yielded serious criminal charges for which the defendant has not been held accountable.” While a spokesman for Mr. Manafort said he had no comment, some legal experts predicted that Mr. Manafort would challenge the new charges on the grounds of double jeopardy.",2.0
2142924,"Turkey’s Currency Falls, Then Rises, in Day of Volatility","LONDON — Turkey’s lira whipsawed in value again on Thursday, as the disclosure of a sudden drop in the central bank’s foreign reserves sparked fears among investors about the country’s economic stewardship. The ailing economy is expected to be a primary concern among voters in local elections on Sunday. The lira dropped as much as 5 percent against the United States dollar on Thursday before recovering to close up 2.4 percent, at 5.541 to the dollar. But investors appeared to be worried about apparent efforts by the Central Bank of Turkey to shore up the lira’s value. Data released by the central bank on Thursday showed that its foreign exchange reserves dropped last week by $2 billion from the week before, to $71 billion, apparently reflecting efforts by the bank to purchase the currency. Capital controls were put in place this week, preventing banks from lending to foreigners in an effort to keep the lira’s value up. Instead of providing reassurance, however, the move caused investors to worry that their cash would remain trapped in Turkey. That prompted many to sell their lira holdings for dollars, depleting the central bank’s reserves — which raised the specter of the bank’s running out of cash, prompting yet more selling. In a research note on Thursday, Per Hammarlund, the chief emerging markets strategist at the SEB Group of Sweden, wrote that Turkish regulators’ “heavy-handed approach” was behind the volatility. Yet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey blamed foreign interference for the lira’s woes. At a gathering with young voters in Ankara on Thursday morning, he said the volatility had arisen from “operations of the West, particularly of the U.S., to corner Turkey.” Others in his government have also taken up that line of attack. Earlier this week, a top economic adviser, Cemil Ertem, cited a “Black Monday” plot to tank Turkey’s economy. And the central bank said Monday that it had an “uptrend” in its reserves, while denying that anything was out of the ordinary. And last weekend, Turkey’s banking regulator announced an inquiry into JPMorgan Chase for providing “misleading and manipulative” investment advice that, it said, prompted a run on the Turkish lira last week. The recent turmoil is only the latest bout of anxiety for investors. Last year, the lira plunged against the dollar over the amount of foreign-denominated debt held by Turkish companies. The pressure lifted after the central bank raised interest rates in the fall. But Mr. Erdogan, who pledged to take more control of the country’s finances after his re-election last year, has railed against high interest rates, arguing — contrary to conventional economics — that they have led to the country’s high inflation. The president’s worries about the lira are rooted in political anxiety heading into Sunday’s elections. Opposition candidates, particularly in strongholds like Ankara and Istanbul, are showing strong gains, according to recent polls. Mr. Hammarlund wrote in his research note that he thought the Turkish government would stop intervening in the currency after the elections. But he added that investors should not rest easy. “I fail to see how the government will restore investor confidence anytime soon,” he wrote.",3.5
2146200,Most Osteoporosis Drugs Don’t Build Bone. This One Does.,"In clinical trials, Evenity substantially increased bone density and prevented fractures more effectively than available treatments, according to the drug makers’ findings. The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved an osteoporosis drug that represents the first new treatment approach in nearly two decades — a strategy based on a rare gene mutation in people with bones so dense that they never break. About 10 million people in the United States have osteoporosis. Worldwide, about 200 million people have brittle bones; one in three women, and one in five men, will suffer a fracture because of osteoporosis, often of the hip or spine. For many, the break leads to a downward spiral of disability. Standard treatments, drugs called bisphosphonates, stop the loss of bone but do not build it. The alternatives, parathyroid hormone and a derivative, build bone but also break it down, limiting the therapeutic effect. The new drug, romosozumab (brand name Evenity), developed by Amgen in collaboration with the Belgian drug company UCB, restores bone without breaking it down, according to the findings of two large clinical trials. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] It was approved only for postmenopausal women with a high risk of fracture, and will carry a warning on its label that it may increase the risk of heart attack or stroke, the F.D.A. said. “This is an extraordinarily important drug,” said Dr. Richard Bockman, chief of the endocrine service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. “It’s a true bone-building drug that takes advantage of the underlying biology of bone.” In large clinical trials, patients taking the drug saw increases in bone density in their spines on the order of 15 percent — a huge figure, similar to the amount of bone made in early adolescence, said Dr. Clifford J. Rosen, an osteoporosis expert at Maine Medical Center Research Institute and member of an F.D.A. panel that evaluated the data. Merely a 6 percent increase in bone density can translate into a doubling of bone strength, Dr. Bockman said. In the trials, patients taking the drugs saw a reduction in breaks, both in the spine and “clinical” fractures — broken bones that a patient notices, rather than, say, a collapsed vertebra discovered only in X-rays. In one study, spinal fractures occurred in 127 of 2,046 patients taking the new drug, compared with 243 of 2,047 taking alendronate, an older drug. “It’s a tremendous advance,” said Dr. Dolores Shoback, a professor of medicine and an osteoporosis expert at the University of California, San Francisco. But there also was a small, unexpected increase in heart attacks, strokes and sudden deaths in that study — 50 of 2,040 patients, or 2.5 percent, taking Evenity, compared with 38 of 2,014, or 1.9 percent, taking alendronate. The effect was seen in one of the two large clinical trials, but not the other. The F.D.A. said it was requiring the boxed warning on the drug’s label saying the drug should not be used by people who had a heart attack or stroke in the past year. Doctors should also consider whether to prescribe the drug to patients at high risk for heart attacks and strokes. Patients who have a heart attack or stroke while taking Evenity should stop taking the drug. Side effects can include joint pain and headaches and irritation at the injection site. The agency is requiring the company to conduct a post-marketing study of cardiovascular risks. It is hard to know what to make of the possible risk, said Dr. Bart Clarke, a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic and president of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. “Maybe there is something unique about those patients,” he said. Amgen would not disclose the price at the time of approval, saying it would be disclosed next week. Evenity will be given as a monthly injection. Parathyroid hormone is given as a daily injection, while the drugs in the other major treatment class, the bisphosphonates, are taken as pills. The new drug has a striking back story. In 1964, researchers began studying an unusual group of Afrikaner patients in South Africa. They were tall and heavy, but not fat. Instead, their bones were large and dense. Their bones grew so profusely that their heads became distorted: Their jaws were large, and an overgrowth of bone in their skulls impinged upon nerves, often causing deafness or facial palsy. Many had terrible headaches. In some, the index and middle fingers fused together. In 2001, scientists reported that all these effects resulted from a single gene mutation. The finding led researchers to understand how the body controls the building of bone. Bones are in a state of constant flux, built up and broken down by the body. In osteoporosis, the balance is disrupted — more bone is broken down than is made. Bone cells make a protein called sclerostin that halts the production of bone and increases its breakdown. The gene mutation in the Afrikaner patients stops the production of sclerostin, so their bodies keep building bone without brakes. Scientists reasoned that if they could mimic the mutation by blocking sclerostin with an antibody, people with osteoporosis should build more bone. Once bone density increased, patients could stop taking the sclerostin-blocking drug and switch to an older drug to maintain the new bone. Animal studies were successful, as were clinical trials, culminating in two large studies involving more than 10,000 postmenopausal women. In one trial, Evenity was compared to a placebo; in the other, it was compared to a bisphosphonate. In both studies, women taking Evenity ended up with more bone and fewer fractures. In January, Evenity was reviewed by an advisory committee to the F.D.A., which voted 18 to 1 for approval — but called for Amgen to do more research to understand the possible cardiovascular side effects. “There is a tremendous need for this medication, and there is an amazing amount of morbidity and mortality with this disease,” said Dr. Frederick G. Kushner, a cardiologist at the Heart Clinic of Louisiana and a panel member, who voted to approve the drug. The next step, Dr. Bockman said, is for companies to develop pills to block sclerostin so patients do not have to have monthly injections. It may not be easy to convince patients to take the new drug. Experts anticipate that it will be offered to patients at highest risk: those who have had a serious fracture, or who have taken bisphosphonates and parathyroid hormone, and did not respond or experienced serious side effects. All too often, however, high-risk patients are afraid to take drugs to prevent fractures. They remember stories of the rare patients who took bisphosphonates and had an unusual fractures or deterioration of the bones in their jaws. “They don’t remember the good — that fractures are being prevented,” Dr. Shoback said. “They remember some pivotal terrible thing that someone told them.” Dr. Bockman has seen these patients, too, but hopes they can be convinced at least to try Evenity. “This is a very important, great new drug,” he said. “And it is something we really need.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of an older drug used to treat osteoporosis. It is alendronate, not aldendronate.",3.5
2150176,How Donald Trump Jr.’s Subpoena Caused a Rift in the G.O.P.,"On Politics With Lisa Lerer Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] Two Republican senators from North Carolina told us an awful lot this week about the state of the G.O.P. in the Trump era. It all started, as so many political stories do these days, with a subpoena — specifically, a decision by the Senate Intelligence Committee, and its Republican chairman, Senator Richard Burr, to subpoena Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, to testify before the panel. You may remember that it was the younger Mr. Trump who met with Russians in June 2016 after being promised political dirt about Hillary Clinton. What, if anything, Mr. Trump told his father about that meeting became the main focus of investigators’ questions when Mr. Trump testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017. Now, as the Senate Intelligence Committee wraps up their work on Russian election interference, Mr. Burr and his colleagues decided to call on Mr. Trump for additional questioning, issuing the subpoena after discussions about him appearing voluntarily broke down. Predictably, that did not sit well with the White House. Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, complained that he wasn’t given a warning that the Republican-led committee planned to subpoena his boss’s son. Trump allies took an anonymous shot at Mr. Burr, calling him “cowardly.” But the most notable pushback came from Senator Thom Tillis, Mr. Burr’s fellow North Carolina Republican. The glaring split between the two gentlemen from North Carolina underscores a rather significant political dynamic for Republicans, one you might want to keep in mind as you think about the possibility of impeachment or a primary challenge to President Trump. Yes, there are disagreements with the president within his own party. But, for the past two years, Mr. Trump holds too much political power over the Republican base for that dissent to ever gain serious political traction. Again and again we’ve seen that the Republicans who emerge as Mr. Trump’s loudest critics are often at the end of their political careers: Neither Jeff Flake nor Bob Corker opted to run for re-election to the Senate in 2018; Senator John McCain was nearly 80 years old when Mr. Trump was elected. In this case, Mr. Burr is the chairman of a committee that prides itself on its bipartisanship. He’s overseeing an investigation that aides say has collected a “mountain” of evidence showing how Russia tried to influence the 2016 election. But, perhaps most significantly, he announced last year that this would be his final term in office. Mr. Tillis, meanwhile, is up for re-election in 2020 and, even more important, facing a primary challenge from the right. The Times reported on Thursday evening that he was under intense pressure from associates of the Trumps to rebuke Mr. Burr. Mr. Tillis explained his thinking to reporters on Capitol Hill on Thursday. “I personally believe Democrats are just trying to keep this thing alive, and it’s their latest launch point to do it,” he said. When a reporter pointed out that Mr. Burr led the committee that issued the subpoena, Mr. Tillis responded: “I think you’d have to speak to Senator Burr. I stand by my comment.” Read more: Allies of Trump’s Son Declare War on G.O.P.-Led Senate Panel After Subpoena [Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox.] ____________________ Drop us a line!

In this edition, readers sound off on their theories of electability in the 2020 race. Michael Kubara wrote in to support a theory from the Democratic strategist David Axelrod: David Axelrod’s theory was voters are pendulum swingers. It seems plausible. The pendulum swings from party to party, but also personality type to opposite personality type. In one way or another, the Democratic candidates are all Trump opposites. But the issue is who can best stand the withering Trump attack. You can’t play nice with bullies. Only Sanders. The rest lack chutzpah, if even some good ideas. Calvin Rittenhouse of Ohio explained his protest theory: Like everyone, the theory I support the most elects my candidates. In my case, that means Sanders or Warren. My particular take on it is that Obama, like Reagan before him, brought out people who don’t usually vote because “they’re all crooked” and they don’t think it will help them or the country to bother voting. Most of us won’t vote for someone we believe stands for big donors ahead of us. Many stay home; I vote for other “protest” candidates. And Mike Shepley of California shared his own theory: I would shift the analysis a bit to an axis in the statistical hyperspace positing a Governor v. Senator shift. It is clear since 1976 we have been in a Governor-dominated cycle. Carter, Reagan, Clinton, Bush Jr. Before that was a Senator-dominated cycle — Truman, J.F.K., L.B.J., Nixon. I would argue that the preference falls on the question, are most voters in an inward looking or internationally concerned mode? Obama suggested a shift to world concern, for many reasons. After Trump I suspect there will obviously be much international damage to clean up. Ergo — 2020, the year of a Dem Senator. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.

2151384,"Philippines Election: Duterte Allies Sweep Senate, Unofficial Results Indicate","MANILA — Allies of President Rodrigo Duterte appear to have swept the elections for the Philippine Senate, according to unofficial results on Tuesday, giving him a stronger grip on the one legislative chamber that had shown some degree of independence from his authoritarian rule. With more than 95 percent of the vote counted, candidates backed by Mr. Duterte looked likely to win all 12 of the seats in the 24-member Senate that were up for election in Monday’s voting. If that is confirmed in the coming days by the Commission on Elections, then a small opposition bloc in the Senate that had managed to thwart some of the president’s agenda will become substantially weaker. One by one, candidates in an opposition alliance known as Otso Diretso, meaning Straight Eight, threw in the towel on Tuesday, and a spokesman for Mr. Duterte essentially declared victory. “The victory of the administration candidates and the shutout of the Otso Diretso candidates send a strong message that our people yearn for stability and continuity of the genuine reforms that the administration started,” the spokesman, Salvador Panelo, said in a statement. He said the new Senate would help in “crafting the president’s legislative agenda.” Unlike the House of Representatives, which has backed Mr. Duterte’s bloody war on drugs, martial law in the south and other policies that have alarmed human rights groups, the Senate has shown some degree of defiance. But the president’s strongest critic in the Senate, Antonio Trillanes, did not seek re-election this week, and another incumbent opposition senator, Bam Aquino, a cousin of the former president Benigno S. Aquino III, appears to have been defeated. That would leave just four anti-Duterte senators — one of whom, Leila de Lima, cannot vote because she has been jailed since 2017 on drug-trafficking charges, which she says were fabricated to silence her. Before her arrest, Ms. de Lima led a Senate panel investigating extrajudicial killings in the drug war, perhaps the most vivid example of the opposition bloc’s defiance of the president. If the sweep by Mr. Duterte’s allies is confirmed, he will be in a stronger position to push policies like revising the Constitution to essentially end term limits; making children as young as 9 subject to prosecution; and bringing back the death penalty, which the Catholic Philippines abolished long ago. Among the 12 Duterte allies apparently headed for the Senate are the president’s longtime aide Bong Go, as well as Ronald dela Rosa, the police chief who spearheaded his war on drugs in its initial stages. That bloody campaign, which has killed thousands since Mr. Duterte took office in 2016, has been condemned internationally but is popular in the Philippines, where a recent poll found that about 80 percent of the public approves of the president’s performance in office. Mr. Panelo, the presidential spokesman, credited the Senate results to “the Duterte magic.” “It was a good fight,” said one opposition candidate, Gary Alejano, a former Marine captain. He added, “For the meantime, let us regroup, reassess and plan, because our love for the country does not depend and end in elections.” Richard Javad Heydarian, a political analyst who teaches at De La Salle University in Manila, said “the more pessimistic assessment is that now President Duterte possesses the supermajority that is necessary to push his authoritarian style of governance to its logical extreme.” But he said the president’s sway in the new Senate might be less strong than it appeared. Most of the 12 apparent victors are “tactical allies with their own points of view,” not through-and-through Duterte supporters, he said. Filipinos also voted on Monday to fill hundreds of seats in the House of Representatives, which was certain to remain in the hands of Duterte allies, as well as local offices across the country. In Mr. Duterte’s hometown, Davao, his three children appeared to have won elections for mayor, vice mayor and representative in Congress, in what some saw as the start of a Duterte dynasty. Mr. Panelo, the spokesman, said the president was opposed to political dynasties, though he acknowledged that many supporters wanted his daughter, Sara Duterte, apparently re-elected as Davao’s mayor, to succeed him as president when his term expires in 2022.",3.5
2158756,Syria: Thousands are trapped in a desert settlement near a US military base," (CNN)Shukri Shehab and his wife have not slept in two nights. Their three-week-old granddaughter will not stop crying. She needs simple medicine for bloating, Shehab says, but it is nearly impossible for them to find.  Shehab lives in Rukban, an informal settlement for Syria's displaced people in a US-protected zone in southern Syria, roughly 10 miles away from an American military base. Shehab has been communicating with CNN over the last four months.  For more than 1,200 days, Shehab says he and his family have lived in this cluster of shelters sprinkled along a stretch of desert on the Syrian-Jordanian border. Activists dubbed it the ""Triangle of Death."" The United Nations called conditions ""desperate,"" ""catastrophic"" and ""no place for a child.""  For years, the displaced in Rukban have been at the mercy of proxy powers and political players, leaving them with sporadic access to humanitarian aid and no safe way home. And for the past five months, the Syrian government has blocked humanitarian access to the encampment through its territories. ""No side is taking responsibility for these people,"" says Aron Lund, a Syria expert and fellow at the Century Foundation, a non-partisan think tank. A State Department official tells CNN the US is ""pursuing every possible avenue to deliver aid to Rukban."" But so far Washington has not directly provided aid to the tens of thousands stuck in the settlement, even though the US has protected the area since 2016. The US has pinned the blame solely on the Syrian government and its Russian allies. Damascus has denied requests for aid deliveries to Rukban since February, pushing instead for civilians to return to regime-controlled areas. ""Rukban is another example of the Assad regime's consistent practice, with Russian support, of facilitating the suffering of its own people while using the situation as a propaganda tool to deflect the blame for its own inhumane behavior,"" Pentagon spokesperson Cmdr. Sean Robertson told CNN in a statement.  In Syria, aid is delivered either cross-border, with the consent of the neighboring country, or through the UN and other humanitarian groups based in Damascus. But Jordan halted regular cross-border deliveries years ago, leaving only the Syrian government in control of approving UN humanitarian aid convoys to the settlement.  Experts say the US can do more to help. Unlike other areas where the regime has denied or prevented humanitarian access, in Rukban ""you have, within the besieged area, a US base and US access. At some point it doesn't really work to say this is (only) the Syrian government's fault. Yes, it is, but then what?"" says Lund.  The US ""could do things for Rukban and they're not doing it. The US could absolutely bring food and especially medicine to Rukban,"" Lund says. ""There is definitely US culpability in this. Is it only the US? No, absolutely not. But it's a situation where the US has grabbed a piece of Syria and says it is not responsible for the people in that part of Syria, which is wrong.""  Trapped in the desert  Most in the settlement fled ISIS, the Syrian government, or both, over the course of Syria's conflict. Many were hoping to cross into Jordan, but the country has denied entry since 2016. They wound up in limbo in the desert encampment.   Today, nearly 25,000 are ""trapped ... languishing in a wasteland,"" Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, Chair of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria, told the UN Human Rights Council earlier this month, according to Reuters. An estimated 80% are believed to be women and children.  ""Me and my family are like everyone else in the camp, just waiting for a kind of solution,"" says Shehab, who is also a member of the Rukban local council. Related: US citizen released from Syria They've been waiting so long that his two eldest sons got married in Rukban. His three grandchildren were all born there. The family lives in one shelter with three mud rooms: one for each young couple and their children, and one for Shehab, his wife and three other children. About a month after ISIS declared its caliphate in June 2014, UN satellite images identified at least 90 makeshift shelters in Rukban. By January 2019, there were nearly 7,800.  Inside Rukban access to drinking water and healthcare is limited. There is no sewage system or formal education. Aid deliveries have always been sporadic, but for the past five months, they have stopped.  ""Food, basic medicine, and other life-saving supplies are no longer available,"" Pinheiro says. Only two deliveries have reached Rukban since early 2018. Damascus denied the UN's March 17 request for a third convoy, without citing a reason. The UN made another request on May 9. It was not approved. When asked earlier this month why the US has not provided aid to fill this gap, US Special Representative for Syria Jim Jeffrey said at the Aspen Security Forum: ""If we feed them, it will look like we're going to stay there forever and there may be other options for them.""  ""We can't commit to a long-term presence in al-Tanf or in any place else in Syria,"" Jeffrey added. According to Lund, ""the US policy ... in Rukban is not to get involved. If you start feeding these people and taking a governance role toward them ... the presence in Syria that you insist as the US government is not an occupation starts looking more like an occupation."" Elsewhere in Syria, the US has previously pushed to improve living conditions for displaced people. In 2017, former US coalition envoy, Brett McGurk, deployed ""experts and diplomats from the State Department and from USAID"" to increase humanitarian access for those displaced by fighting against ISIS in the north.  But for a host of political reasons, US policy towards Rukban is unique, shaped by the mission of its base there.  Area is a 'political football' Rukban's humanitarian crisis is deeply entwined in Syria's fraught geopolitics. The settlement is near the strategic intersection of the Syrian, Jordanian and Iraqi borders, and it is within an area that currently hosts some 200 American troops at a US military base at al-Tanf, considered key to countering Iran's influence in Syria.  ""The US presence there was first about anti-ISIS. Now it's about anti-Iran, and the camp is caught in the middle,"" says Neil Hauer, an independent security analyst.  The US continues to support a local rebel group in and around Rukban, Maghawir al-Thawra, which claims to be fighting ISIS. As recently as July 29, the group posted a video on Twitter of what it called a ""successful training"" carried out ""with coalition forces"" to ensure the area ""remains safe from #Daesh,"" referring to ISIS. ""The camp's presence makes the entire area another political football in that turning it over to Russia and Damascus is something else the US don't want to do, at least for free,"" says Hauer.  Rukban is also located within a US-Russia ""deconfliction zone,"" meaning Russian and Syrian government-aligned forces are not supposed to enter. Almost by default, this means the two are keen to regain control of the area as battles elsewhere end. ""They see it as a US controlled zone. It's like if Russia occupied part of Texas, then the US would be angry about it,"" Lund says.  Since the beginning of this year, Moscow appeared determined to deal with Rukban. Syria and Russia set up two ""humanitarian corridors"" in February for civilians to leave. In March, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote a tweet, later deleted, that read: ""We appeal to the entire international community to support the idea of liquidating the Rukban camp, this hotbed of violence, crime...""  More than 17,000 people -- some 42% of the initial 41,700 -- have left since late March, the UN says.  Russia and Syria have accused the US of blocking the departure of the rest, with Moscow slamming the US presence in the area as an ""occupation."" The US has denied these claims.  People are leaving ""in part because Russia and the (Syrian) Regime are blocking them from access to food and other basic needs,"" Pentagon spokesperson Cmdr. Sean Robertson says, adding that the displaced ""must not be forced to make decisions under threat of starvation or severe deprivation.""  Living within the US deconfliction zone has provided de-facto cover from the aerial bombardments, ISIS attacks and arbitrary arrests that have been reported in other areas outside the government's control, experts and those in Rukban say. Nearly everyone in Rukban wants to leave, a recent UN survey found.   But ""there is a trust issue,"" says the World Food Program's Marwa Awad, who was in Rukban in February. ""People are afraid of coming out because of the process that might unfold afterward.""  Many fear arrest if they return to regime areas, according to Shehab. Families worry ""about their young guys because there are rumors, they have been conscripted.""  'From bad to worse' Since the last aid convoy reached Rukban, life has gone ""from bad to worse,"" Shehab says. Shehab's granddaughter's health has improved since those sleepless nights, weeks ago, but he now faces new hurdles. Her mother has been unable to make enough milk for her, putting Shehab on the hunt for one of the settlement's most coveted and rarest commodities: baby formula. Related: Syrian girl dies after saving sister's life in airstrike photo After much effort, Shehab says he secured two boxes for about 30,000 SYP ($60) each.  Food enters Rukban via smuggling routes, and the prices are high but ""the most important thing is that it's coming in,"" Shehab says.  All sides eschew their responsibility by claiming those in Rukban have the choice to leave. But for civilians in Syria, there is very seldom a good way out of their problems. In areas previously under Syrian government siege, the choice given to civilians was surrender or starve. During US-led offensives against ISIS, people could flee or risk becoming collateral damage. In ISIS-held territory the choice was often between allegiance or death.  Shehab has faced these choices before. He fled ISIS and the regime in two cities within a year before arriving in Rukban. ""I will not leave the camp because I refuse to return to the areas controlled by the Assad regime,"" Shehab says. ""Unfortunately, there is no hope for a solution anytime soon."" Clarification: This story has been updated to reflect that the UN satellite images were captured in January 2019. And that the Syrian government denied a May 9 request by the UN to deliver aid. ",3.0
2172505,Judge questions Alaska agency's finding of 'emergency' to cut Medicaid payments | TheHill,"A judge on Friday ruled that Alaska’s Department of Health and Social Services may have declared an emergency that was the basis for cuts to the state’s Medicaid program under false pretenses, according to the Anchorage Daily News. In her ruling Friday, Superior Court Judge Jennifer Henderson said the lawsuit raised “at the very least, serious and substantial questions regarding DHSS’ finding of emergency” and added that the court was “inclined to grant a preliminary injunction as to emergency regulations, because those regulations lack a necessary precondition, namely, an actual emergency.” In a July lawsuit, the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association accused the department of unlawfully declaring an emergency to make the 7 percent cuts in Medicaid payments to health care providers. The department’s commissioner, Adam Crum, who was appointed by Gov. Mike Dunleavy (R), issued a June finding of emergency allowing the department to skip straight to the cuts without the typical public input process for such changes, citing a 2020 budget that “significantly underfunded” the program. Henderson added that given her likely conclusions, “the Court welcomes additional, responsive evidence and/or briefing on the issues of DHSS’ finding of emergency, the amount of any ordered bond, and any changes in the parties’ procedural request of the Court in handling these issues.” She asked the department and the plaintiffs to each submit such evidence by Friday. “The judge’s order is encouraging,” said Becky Hultberg, president of the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association, told the Daily News. “She seems to agree that the situation was not an emergency justifying the use of emergency regulations.” ""The court did not at this time issue an injunction so the rates adopted by regulation on July 1, 2019 are still currently in effect. The court stated that it would consider additional evidence and briefings on the nature of the emergency and on the bond ASHNHA would be required to post if the court issues the injunction,"" a spokesperson for DHSS said in a statement to The Hill.

2176637,Norway's Statkraft looks to expand in Brazil's renewables: executive,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Norway’s power generator Statkraft AS [STATKF.UL] plans to sharply increase its capacity to produce renewable energy in Brazil in the next four to five years, the head of the Brazilian unit, Fernando de Lapuerta, told Reuters. The company is looking to acquire some Brazilian projects and also plans to take part in coming rounds where the government awards licenses for construction of new power plants, the executive said in an interview on Tuesday. “Statkraft targets a certain scale and size in markets it considers as having potential. Brazil is one of them because it has world-class solar and wind resources, and it is a market being liberalized,” Lapuerta said. “Our aim is to increase the size of the Brazilian unit, which is still small. The target is to at least triple or quadruple it in four to five years,” he said. The Norwegian company plans to have only renewable assets in the portfolio, particularly wind farms and solar parks but also small hydroelectric plants. It currently manages 22 power generation assets in Brazil, with capacity to produce 450 megawatts. Lapuerta declined to give an estimate of how much the company could invest in coming years to reach the expected growth. He said that an alternate way to grow would be working in the non-regulated power market in Brazil, where companies who are large consumers clinch long-term supply deals with power generators. Those contracts could justify investments in new projects. Reporting by Luciano Costa; Writing by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Lisa Shumaker",3.5
2177183,Churchill's grandson to be expelled from Conservative Party after defying Johnson,"LONDON (Reuters) - Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Britain’s World War Two leader Winston Churchill, will be expelled from the Conservative Party after voting against Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit. The move against the Conservative Party grandee marks one of the most bizarre turns in the three-year Brexit crisis that has gripped a country once touted as a confident pillar of Western economic and political stability. Soames was one of 21 Conservative lawmakers who rebelled, including Ken Clarke, 79, the longest continuously sitting British lawmaker in the House of Commons, and former finance minister Philip Hammond. All are to be expelled. When Soames was asked if this was the end of the Conservative Party his grandfather would have known, he said: “No. But it’s a bad night. “It is a pity - a great pity - that this has in my view all been planned: this is exactly what they wanted and they will try to have a general election which is what they wanted.” Since he took office as prime minister six weeks ago, Johnson has been ruthless: He oversaw one of the biggest purges of cabinet ministers in modern British history and has cut short a session of parliament to increase the likelihood Britain will leave the EU, with or without a deal. After a defeat at the hands of an alliance of opposition lawmakers and rebels in his own party, Johnson’s enforcers will speak to those who defied his order and expel them, a Downing Street spokesman said. In total, lawmakers with more 330 years experience in parliament will be expelled from Johnson’s party - the same party which lost its working majority on Tuesday. “I have been told by the chief whip, who is my friend and who I like very much, that it will be his sad duty to write to me tomorrow to tell me I have had the whip removed after 37 years as a Conservative member of parliament,” Soames said. “That’s fortunes of war. I knew what I was doing.” Soames, 71, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2014, has been a member of parliament since 1983 and previously served as a junior defence minister. He is the son of Mary Soames, the youngest of Churchill’s five children. Churchill occupies a special place in British culture as the victor of World War Two and by far the most powerful British statesman of the 20th Century - a ‘British bulldog’ who could hold his own with Josef Stalin and Harry Truman. Johnson has repeatedly spoken of his admiration for Churchill, and in 2014 published a biography called “The Churchill Factor: How One Man Made History.” In the introduction, Johnson, then mayor of London, wrote: “When I was growing up there was no doubt about it. Churchill was quite the greatest statesman that Britain had ever produced.” As a young boy, Soames said he was unaware of his grandfather’s significance and has recounted how, when aged five, he once visited Churchill in his bedroom and asked him: “Grandpapa, is it true that you are the greatest man in the world?” Churchill replied: “Yes, now bugger off.” Andrew Adonis, a member of the opposition Labour Party, said Churchill would have deselected from Conservative if it was run like it is now because he opposed then prime minister Neville Chamberlain attempt to secure peace with Germany’s Adolf Hitler a year before World War Two. “Churchill himself would have been deselected,” he said. “Chamberlain bitterly attacked him for ‘undermining his negotiating position’ at Munich and there was a deselection attempt.” A source close to the group who have voted against the government said Tuesday’s vote is the first step in a process to avert an economically damaging no-deal exit. “No. 10 have responded by removing the whip from two former chancellors, a former lord chancellor and Winston Churchill’s grandson,” the source said. “What has happened to the Conservative Party?” Additional reporting by Kate Holton, Elizabeth Piper and William James; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge",4.0

The business is the main exporting sector in Italy, which is home to firms including Prada and Salvatore Ferragamo, with around 75% of its turnover generated abroad. “It’s been a tough year, weighed down by an unfavorable international environment. Next year, we hope to return to the growth rates we are used to”, Carlo Capasa, chairman of Italy’s National Fashion Chamber, said on Thursday.

2180467,Travel Influencers Held in Iranian Prison After Using a Drone for Blog,"An Australian couple traveling in Iran has been arrested all for trying to capture footage for their blog. Jolie King and Mark Firkin, who are also British passport-holders, have spent the last 10 weeks in Evin prison in Tehran after they were caught flying a drone without a license, 9 News and The Guardian reported. The travel influencers reportedly uploaded over 60 videos, which were taken at secluded sites, Deakin University professor of Middle East politics Shahram Akbarzadeh told 9 News. Flying a drone in those areas is considered “highly suspicious,” in Iran, Akbarzadeh said. “Iran authorities see a threat in every corner,” Akbarzadeh told 9 News. King and Firkin were reportedly camping in a military area around Jajrood, according to The Guardian. The couple shared a number of vlogs from their travels on their Youtube channel The Way Overland. The pair also shared their experiences on a joint Instagram account by the same name. Their most recent video was shot in Pakistan. The couple has over 20,000 YouTube subscribers and over 19,000 followers on Instagram. King has also shared vivid memories from her many trips to her personal Instagram account, which include shots of her snorkeling in the deep blue waters of Bali, sightseeing in India and most recently horseback riding in Kyrgyzstan. Her last post was uploaded on June 26. After weeks of silence, King’s followers grew worried about her whereabouts. “I hope you guys are okay,” one follower wrote. “GUYS WHERE ARE YOU ITS BEEN A MONTH — R U OKAY???” a different follower wrote on their joint account. News of their arrest was made public on Wednesday. The families of the couple have since released a statement via The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs saying, “Our families hope to see Mark and Jolie safely home as soon as possible,” ABC Australia reported. The Australian government is currently negotiating the couple’s release, The Guardian reported. An attorney for the couple could not immediately be found. It is not immediately clear if their case will go to trial or what charges are being brought against them. According to their blog, King and Firkin have been dating for six years and moved together to Perth in 2015. They began traveling around the world in 2017. The couple explained that after exploring Iran they had planned to travel to Turkey. ",3.0
2182354,"Dennis Rodman, who hangs with Trump and Kim, says Korea peace deal 'could still work'","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Former U.S. basketball star Dennis Rodman, one of a handful of Westerners to have met North Korean head of state Kim Jong Un, and a friend of U.S. President Donald Trump, said on Monday he thought the two leaders could work out a deal. “I think that it could still work. I just think that we need to stay on the right path to make it work,” said Rodman, who was at the June 2018 Singapore summit between Kim and Trump - the first between leaders of the two states who have been technically at war since the of the Korean War in 1953. “So, I think that people should not give up on the U.S. trying to engage with North Korea in a good, safe manner,” Rodman told Reuters television in an interview. North Korea said on Monday it was willing to restart nuclear talks with the United States in late September, but warned that chances of a deal could end unless Washington takes a fresh approach. “I think Kim Jong Un wants peace. I know him very well, I think he wants peace. I think ... people don’t realize that he wants to move on into the 21st century. I think he doesn’t want to give up his country. I don’t blame him.” “But I think, you know, everything else is in the way,” he said of the stalemated talks that would have North Korea dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions that have crippled its economy. Rodman said Trump put him on his reality show “The Apprentice” years ago “to help and guide me ... because I was out there being buck wild, doing my thing, having a good time. That’s his way of showing that he cares about me.” Rodman’s earlier visits to North Korea included a basketball game he organized, an event chronicled in the documentary film “Big Bang in Pyongyang,” which featured Rodman singing “Happy Birthday” to Kim, as well as scenes of inebriated and erratic behavior by the basketball Hall of Famer. Asked if he has Kim’s and Trump’s numbers in his dated phone, Rodman replied: “You think people have a number in this damn phone? A flip phone?

2182742,Germany ready to take one in four migrants rescued off Italy: minister,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany is ready to take in a quarter of migrants who reach Italy by sea, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said in remarks published on Friday, signaling a goodwill gesture to a southern neighbor ahead of EU talks on immigration later this month. European Union countries want to reach a temporary agreement on sharing out the care for migrants who reach the bloc’s shores when interior ministers meet in Malta on Sept. 23. EU states have been at odds on the issue since a surge in 2015 in arrivals of people fleeing conflicts and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. “If all that has been agreed stands, we would be able to take in 25% of people rescued at sea and who end up in Italy,” Seehofer told the Sueddeutsche newspaper. “This will not overwhelm our migration policy.” Italy and Greece have long complained about the lack of an EU solution to immigrant arrivals. EU efforts to establish a quota system have been unsuccessful, meeting stiff resistance from eastern states. An increase in migrant arrivals by sea over the summer months had strained relations between the EU states and fellow member Italy, whose former far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini closed Italy’s ports to boats rescuing the new arrivals in the Mediterranean. “I have always said that our immigration policy is humane,” Seehofer added. “We will let no one drown.” A new Italian government sworn in last week has promised to change tack on boat rescues. On Thursday Italy said it had done a deal with EU countries to share out migrants aboard a charity ship at sea in the Mediterranean. Reporting by Joseph Nasr; Editing by Frances Kerry",4.0
2188403,GRAINS-Corn rebounds on U.S. crop rating; favourable weather caps gains,"* Corn rebounds from 4-month low as U.S. crop condition declines * Warmer weather forecast across U.S. grain belt for 2 weeks * Wheat near 2-week top on concerns over southern hemisphere crops (Adds details, quote) SINGAPORE, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Chicago corn futures gained almost 1% on Tuesday, rebounding from a four-month low hit in the previous session after a U.S. government report showed a decline in crop condition across the country's key-growing areas. Wheat rose for a second session to its highest since late August on worries over production in southern hemisphere, while soybeans edged higher. The most-active corn contract on the Chicago Board Of Trade was up 0.9% at $3.57-1/2 a bushel, as of 0348 GMT. In the previous session, it hit $3.52-1/4 a bushel, its lowest since May 13. Wheat added 0.5% to $4.76-3/4 a bushel, having closed 2.3% higher on Monday and soybeans gained 0.2% at $8.59-3/4 a bushel. ""It is a weather-driven market, the USDA's weekly crop report is supporting prices. Coming weeks are crucial ahead of the harvest,"" a Singapore-based grains trader said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said 55% of the U.S. corn crop was in good-to-excellent shape, as of Sunday, down 3 points from a week earlier, and below market forecasts. The agency said 55% of the soybean crop was in good-to-excellent condition, matching analysts' forecasts. The U.S. Crop Watch producers have reported slower-than-normal development in their corn and soybeans all season because of late planting and cooler temperatures, but the warmer weather for the next two weeks is exactly what the crops need to help push them toward the finish line, Karen Braun, a market analyst for Reuters wrote in a column. The mid-May planted soybeans have started to make the turn toward maturity, but the later-planted ones have not, which implies there is still time for rains to make a difference for the filling of pods. The wheat market is being underpinned by expectations of lower production in Australia and Argentina. Australia on Tuesday trimmed its wheat production forecast during the 2019/20 season by nearly 10% as prolonged dry weather across the country's east coast wilts production. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences pegged production at 19.2 million tonnes, down from its previous estimate in June of 21.9 million tonnes. Argentina's wheat crop could be damaged by dryness in the western part of the country's farm belt if rains do not appear over the weeks ahead in time for key development stages, local climate specialists said on Monday.

Trump tweeted that his own ""views on Venezuela, and especially Cuba, were far stronger than those of John Bolton. He was holding me back!” Bolton, who is known for his hawkish positions on U.S. policy toward Cuba and Venezuela, was ousted by Trump on Tuesday in dramatic fashion. The former aide was a vocal advocate for ending the government of Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro and was seen as a driving force behind the White House’s push to oust the South American leader. The Washington Post reported in May that Trump had expressed frustration over the lack of progress on the effort. The Trump administration months ago backed opposition leader Juan Guaidó, but Maduro to this day remains in power. Trump unveiled sanctions on the government of Venezuela at the beginning of August, in what was viewed as an escalation in the White House’s efforts to oust Maduro despite the current stalemate. The Trump administration has also levied sanctions on Cuba in part for its support of Maduro, and sought to reverse former President Obama’s push to normalize U.S. relations with Havana during the previous administration. Trump has also pushed for bringing troops home from abroad, while Bolton was long an advocate for an expansive military presence around the world. Their differing foreign policy views had long put the two at odds, but their disagreements seemed to fester in recent months, coming to a head following Trump’s scrapped plans to invite the Taliban to Camp David over the weekend. Bolton is said to have been vocally opposed to the idea, which would have happened days before the 18th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Trump publicly rebuked Bolton during an Oval Office meeting Wednesday, claiming Bolton “set us back” and that he disagreed with important people in the administration. Trump blamed Bolton for missteps on North Korea and also dinged him for his support for the Iraq War. “And it set us back, and frankly he wanted to do things — not necessarily tougher than me — You know John’s known as a tough guy. He’s so tough he got us into Iraq … but he’s actually somebody I had a very good relationship with. But he wasn’t getting along with people in the administration that I consider very important,” Trump told reporters. Trump’s tweet on Thursday came in response to one from Sen. Marco RubioMarco Antonio RubioTrump faces difficult balancing act with reelection campaign Republicans wary of US action on Iran California poll: Biden, Sanders lead Democratic field; Harris takes fifth MORE (R-Fla.), who said he spoke with Trump about Venezuela and that the president told him he disagreed with Bolton on issues but that his views are “the DIRECT OPPOSITE of what many claim or assume.” Rubio said that Trump assured him that if “the direction of policy changes it won’t be to make it weaker.” View the discussion thread.

2191446,CNN's Toobin defends 'colleague and friend' McCabe as DOJ moves toward charges | TheHill,"CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin defended former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabeAndrew George McCabeMcCabe says he would 'absolutely not' cut a deal with prosecutors We've lost sight of the real scandal Former Obama officials willing to testify on McCabe's behalf: report MORE on Thursday as the Justice Department moves forward with pressing charges against him.  Toobin, who described McCabe as a ""colleague and friend,"" said on CNN the case is ""complicated"" and an ""extremely unusual prosecution"" after a U.S. attorney recommended moving forward with charges against McCabe, who was recently brought on as a CNN contributor. ""Lying to an inspector general is very rarely prosecuted,"" Toobin said. ""Lying in these very esoteric circumstances where it's about this conversation, that conversation is rare."" The comments follow the Department of Justice's (DOJ) rejection of McCabe's appeal to avert criminal charges for lacking ""candor"" with federal investigators. He was fired in March 2018, two days before his scheduled retirement, for allegedly not being forthcoming in investigations. The FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility and Office of the Inspector General found McCabe revealed unauthorized information to the media about investigations into the Clinton Foundation. DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz had said that McCabe ""lacked candor — including under oath — on multiple occasions.""

""You spoke to the reporters — months later, describe what was in the conversation that you already, that you had every right to have, at a time when he's being interviewed about a different subject,"" Toobin said. He defended McCabe's record as ""impeccable,"" describing him as ""one of the most honored and successful FBI agents of his generation"" and criticized the president for going on a crusade to ""disparage"" McCabe.

2197437,Minnesota's Collier takes WNBA's top rookie prize,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Napheesa Collier fended off fierce competition to become the WNBA’s Rookie of the Year on Monday, with the Minnesota Lynx standout capping a prolific season in which she logged 444 regular season points with an early-career accolade. Collier exploded into the league in a season-opener against Chicago that saw the first-round draft pick score 27 points, the second-most ever by a player in a WNBA debut. The 22-year-old, a college star at UConn, told Reuters the performance helped her move past a disappointing pre-season. “I definitely took a second to appreciate it because I didn’t feel like I played well in the pre-season games,” Collier said, reflecting on the 89-71 season-opening win. “I was just going out there to have fun and let loose and I think that’s what allowed me to play well because I was kind of wound up in those other pre-season games. Having not a great pre-season – pre-season games – I knew I had to step up my game.” Collier kept the momentum going and carved out her position with the team early, as the Lynx brought on a raft of young talent in a bid to recapture glory after winning the WNBA title in 2017 but losing in the first round of the play-offs in 2018. “A lot of people didn’t think we were going to be in the place that we were in. Just with rebuilding and having so many new people,” said Collier. “I think it definitely gave me a chance to prove myself and play a lot early and kind of establish myself in the league.” Riding a wave of optimism this year, the four-times champion Lynx won five of their final six regular season games, but saw their year cut short in the post-season with an 84-74 Round 1 loss to the Seattle Storm. But Collier said her team’s late season performance was cause for optimism. “Especially toward the end we really started figuring it out. We had a lot of highs and lows through the year but we ended on a five out of six winning streak,” said Collier. “Going into that last game we were really on a roll.” Next up, Collier said she will travel to Miami to train for the AmeriCup, held later this month in Puerto Rico.

2202014,Trump Officials Are Reportedly Pushing Their Anti-Abortion Cause to UN Members," Want the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here. The Trump administration is ramping up its fight against abortion at the United Nations, as top officials have signed a letter asking member states to fight for individual countries’ ability to “determine the best way to protect the unborn and defend the family,” the Guardian reported Monday. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar reportedly signed the letter, which was sent to governments who may also oppose abortion. The letter asks them to join a statement that proclaims their opposition to U.N. initiatives that support sexual and reproductive health and that, in the Trump administration’s view, could expand abortion access, according to the Guardian. That statement is expected to be presented at the U.N. General Assembly on Monday, in a meeting on health coverage, the Guardian reported. “As a key priority in global health promotion, we respectfully request that your government join the United States in ensuring that every sovereign state has the ability to determine the best way to protect the unborn and defend the family as the foundational unity of society vital to children thriving and leading healthy lives,” the letter reportedly read. Read more: Federal judge rips ‘abortion reversal’ as ‘devoid of scientific support.’ The letter reportedly went on to claim that some U.N. policies have sought to create a “new international right to abortion.” “Evidence of this is found in references throughout many multilateral global health policy documents to interpret ‘comprehensive sexuality education’ and ‘sexual and reproductive health’ and ‘sexual and reproductive health and rights’ to diminish the role of parents in the most sensitive and personal family-oriented issues,” the letter continued. “The latter has been asserted to mean promotion of abortion, including pressuring countries to abandon religious principles and cultural norms enshrined in law that protect unborn life.” The letter seems to mark the latest attempt by the Trump administration to remove references to sexual and reproductive health in U.N. human rights efforts. Its officials have also reportedly sought to wipe the word “gender” from the U.N.’s vocabulary, a move the Guardian called an apparent “part of the Trump administration’s campaign to define transgender people out of existence.” The State Department did not return the Guardian’s request for comment about the letter. In an emailed statement to VICE News, an HHS spokesperson said that the letter had been sent to ministers in 72 countries ahead of Monday’s meeting, “voicing U.S. concern about an aggressive effort in international settings that could decrease life-saving healthcare for millions of women.” The spokesperson said the letter called on countries to partner with the U.S in “supporting health for all people, born and unborn.” They added, “Working with other nations on these shared health priorities will increase access to vital healthcare and advance optimal health outcomes for women, children, and adolescents — often the most vulnerable groups.” Cover: U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo addresses the Family Research Council's Value Voters Summit at the Omni Shoreham Hotel September 21, 2018 in Washington, DC.

2203591,UN postal agency seeks to persuade US not to quit over Trump fee hike demand,"GENEVA, Sept 24 (Reuters) - The U.N. body responsible for cooperation between countries’ postal services held emergency talks on Tuesday to persuade the United States not to quit over President Donald Trump’s demand to hike the fees Washington charges to deliver foreign mail. The Trump administration has told the Universal Postal Union based in the Swiss capital Bern that it will quit unless the agency agrees to let countries charge more to deliver mail they receive from abroad. Last October Washington set a 12 month deadline. “In an age of e-commerce the United States is being forced to heavily subsidize small parcels coming into our country. Many are from China but this is not strictly a China problem,” White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who heads the U.S. delegation, told journalists in Geneva. The UPU sets international postal rates that include strict caps on “terminal dues”, the charges postal services collect from each other to cover the cost of delivering international mail. Navarro said the system had led to the United States Postal System paying what he described as annual “subsidies” of $300 million to $500 million to cover the cost of delivering mail across the United States that originates in other countries. “So we lose hundreds of millions of dollars a year, tens of thousands of jobs, and the factories and economic growth associated with them,” Navarro said. “When President Trump was briefed, he said ‘that’s crazy, fix it’. We set about doing it in ‘Trump time’, which is to say as quickly as possible,” Navarro said. Bishar Hussein, UPU secretary-general, said that his nearly 150-year-old organisation had “the duty to ensure that everyone on this planet has access to the international mail”. “Our overarching ambition is to uphold ‘One world. One postal network,’ he told the three-day extraordinary congress. The U.S. delegation has said it would be willing to accept a two-phased option allowing the United States to impose new rates immediately while giving other countries five years to do so. Democrats Abroad, the arm of the Democratic Party for Americans overseas, has warned of chaos and urged its members to lobby their Senators and representatives against the proposal by the Republican administration to quit the body. “If the withdrawal goes forward, postal mail service to the United States will be thrown into disarray and the USPS expects postal service to and from the States to be massively disrupted,” the group said in a statement. Navarro said Washington could quit without problems. “We have prepared for a seamless transition. There will be absolutely no disruption in military mail, election mail, or holiday mail,” he said.

2211333,"Anheuser-Busch cuts ties with Carson King, who raised a million dollars for a hospital through beer money"," (CNN)Carson King raised more than $1 million for an Iowa children's hospital, borne out of a request for beer money on national TV. But old racist tweets ended his relationship with the beer company that promised to match his fundraising. Anheuser-Busch announced it would no longer associate with King after he admitted posting two offensive tweets in 2012 when he was a 16-year-old high school student. ""Carson King had multiple social media posts that do not align with our values as a brand or as a company and we will have no further association with him,"" the company said in a statement to CNN. The 24-year-old shot to fame when he appeared on ESPN's ""College GameDay"" program earlier this month, holding a sign that said ""Busch Light Supply Needs Replenished"" with his Venmo username. Donations poured in, and after buying one case of Busch Light, he said he decided to send the rest of money to the University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital. Anheuser-Busch and Venmo promised to match whatever King could raise. In now-deleted tweets, Busch Beer promised to send King, dubbed the ""Iowa Legend,"" a year's supply of beer cans with his face and name on them. Anheuser-Busch spokesperson Matt Kohan told CNN on Wednesday that the company would still donate more than $350,000 to the hospital as promised, but it had rescinded its beer offer. Instead, it will add the value of the year's supply to its donation. The episode is being held up as the latest example of cancel culture, in which people, usually celebrities, are publicly shunned and boycotted after allegations of problematic behavior come to light.  King said a Des Moines Register reporter pointed out the tweets while interviewing King for a profile, which prompted him to hold a press conference Tuesday before the paper's story was published.  One of the tweets compared black mothers to gorillas and another joked about black people who were killed in the Holocaust, the Des Moines Register reported.  ""Once he pointed it out and I went back and looked at it, I was really upset with myself,"" he told reporters at the conference, CNN affiliate WHO reported. King apologized in the press conference before the paper published the profile online. The comments were made as jokes between friends, King said in a statement on Twitter. He called the posts ""an attempt at humor that was offensive and hurtful.""  ""Obviously I've made mistakes in my past; everyone has,"" he said in the conference. ""And I really hope people see at this point in my life, I'm grown, I'm caring, I'm generous. I hope that's what people focus on."" Readers turned on the newspaper The story took another turn after the paper published the profile online on Tuesday night.  Readers posted comments on Twitter questioning why the Des Moines Register had dug so far into King's life, surfacing questionable tweets from when he was a teenager.  The paper posted a statement on Twitter in response to the online backlash. They defended the reporter, Aaron Calvin, saying that looking at a person's public social media posts was a routine part of working on a profile. ""Some of the toughest decisions in journalism are about what to publish ⁠-- or not,"" Des Moines Register executive editor Carol Hunter wrote in a Tuesday statement.  ""The jokes were highly inappropriate and were public posts. Shouldn't that be acknowledged to all the people who had donated money to King's cause or were planning to do so?"" Hunter wrote. ""The counter arguments: The tweets were posted seven years ago, when King was 16. And he was remorseful. Should we chalk up the posts to a youthful mistake and omit the information?"" The editor said the paper ultimately decided to include the information at the bottom of the story to remain transparent about what they'd found.  After the paper tweeted the statement, people on Twitter began sharing past offensive tweets by Calvin. One of the Des Moines Register reporter's now-deleted tweets used a racial slur against black people, while others made derogatory comments against gay people, same-sex marriage and women, The Washington Post reported. Once the posts were shared widely, Calvin tweeted, ""I have deleted previous tweets that have been inappropriate or insensitive. I apologize for not holding myself to the same high standards as the Register holds others,"" according to a screengrab published by the Washington Post.  The paper tweeted early Wednesday morning that it's investigating the reporter's ""inappropriate"" tweets. The reporter's account was set to private as of Wednesday. When contacted by CNN on Wednesday, Calvin directed questions to the paper.  Hunter, editor of the paper, declined to comment to CNN on Thursday.  Calvin's byline appeared online in the Register on Wednesday evening, after the paper had said it was investigating. Money keeps coming in The controversy hasn't stalled donations, though. King told reporters Tuesday that he still planned to raise $2 million for the hospital. ""I'm just glad that Busch and Venmo are matching the donations and that we can continue to make a difference for the hospital,"" King told CNN by phone on Wednesday evening.  ""We're actually at $1.5 million in donations. I'm happy that we can keep helping them, the kids and families of the hospitals,"" he said. Venmo did not respond to a CNN request for comment. Reached Wednesday evening, the University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital said it would not be issuing a statement at this time, though last week, University of Iowa Healthcare spokesman Tom Moore told CNN the hospital was coordinating a time for King to ""bring the donation over and present the check"" in early October.  On Wednesday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds recognized King for all the money he's raised, signing a proclamation declaring Saturday as Carson King Day. When asked for comment, Reynold's spokesman directed CNN to a tweet the governor shared Wednesday.  ""You can make a mistake in your life, and still go on to do amazing things,"" she tweeted. ""@CarsongKing2, thank you for reminding us all of that! #IowaProud.""  ",3.5
2213766,Android 10’s impressive Live Caption feature will likely launch on Pixel 4,"At Google I/O in May, Google showed off an impressive new accessibility feature coming to Android 10: Live Caption, which can automatically transcribe spoken audio from videos or audio playing on your phone. My colleague Dieter Bohn spent some time with Live Caption when it was announced and found it to be one of the most exciting features coming to Android 10. It’s not just about accessibility, either; think of the moments where you’ve wanted to know what’s being said in a video but didn’t have headphones nearby. Now you can do it without annoying anybody with the loudspeaker, since Live Caption works even if the volume is turned all the way down. However, Live Caption wasn’t ready in time for Android 10’s release (despite it being advertised on Google’s Android 10 website) — but new evidence suggests it could debut on the Pixel 4 next month. XDA Developers was able to install Live Caption on a Pixel 2 XL using APKs that were apparently lifted from a Pixel 4 device. And it seems to work just like Google promised. In its tests, XDA Developers successfully tested Live Caption with Amazon Prime Video, Google Photos, Google Podcasts, Netflix, and YouTube. Screenshots seem to show that you’ll be able to quickly activate Live Captions from the volume panel (if you turn this shortcut on in the settings menu), and there’s also a toggle to “mask profanity” if you want to replace many of the letters in inappropriate words with asterisks. Here’s a video from XDA Developers of Live Caption transcribing a YouTube video: The fact that XDA Developers got this working on a Pixel 2 XL suggests that the feature should technically be able to support phones other than the Pixel 4. But if I had to guess, Google might roll the feature out first on its latest flagship phones before bringing it to other Pixel and Android devices. It has a track record of doing this with big features; last year, Call Screen launched first on the Pixel 3 before expanding to other products. Google has a hardware event on October 15th, where the company is expected to announce the Pixel 4 (among other new devices) after weeks of thorough leaks. Perhaps we’ll see more of Live Caption and see more demos then.",4.5
2217812,The branding on carbon pricing could matter a lot to voters in 2020,"A new Emerson College poll suggests that the wording around carbon pricing — whether voters support a carbon ""tax"" versus a carbon ""fine on corporations"" — could matter a lot. Why it matters: Several 2020 White House hopefuls — including Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren — have endorsed some kind of pricing, though details are scarce. What they found: Emerson polled slightly over 1,000 voters on Sept. 21–23. The question: ""Would you support or oppose a carbon tax?"" The answer: 35% supported it, 27% opposed and 38% percent were unsure. (Margin of error is 4.9%.) The question, posed to the other half of the group: ""Would you support or oppose a fine on corporations that pollute the air with carbon dioxide?” The answer: 52% supported it, 25% opposed and 24% were unsure. (MOE is 4.3%.) But, but, but: The level of public support for a given policy is just loosely related to its chances of advancement. Needless to say, there are all kinds of detailed policy design questions beyond the scope of these 30,000-foot level questions. But generally speaking, a fine on companies would probably seep through into their prices. Go deeper: Carbon tax campaign unveils new details and backers Editor's note: This story has been clarified to reflect that, when asked about a ""carbon tax,"" 35% of voters polled by Emerson supported the measure and 27% opposed it.",4.5
2218191,Trump trade war rebounds hard on America's lumber workers,"Lumber mills in the U.S. have been a casualty of President Trump's trade war with China, as a significant dip in demand has pushed hardwood lumber prices down, the Wall Street Journal reports. Why it matters: Chinese buyers were critical for lumber after the 2008 financial crisis, as American construction and furniture production dropped. Now, Beijing's retaliatory tariffs on as much as 25% of lumber and wood imports are draining the U.S. industry.  By the numbers: The percentage of American hardwood exports to China dropped from a peak 54.19% in 2017 to 49.5% in 2018, according to the Department of Agriculture.  By this year, that number dropped to 41.34%.  As of August, lumber prices fell 20% from the previous year.  Other countries are reaping the benefits of the American market's downfall. Russia and Gabon now make up 17% of imports by value, up from 12% through July of 2018. The Trump administration and Congress have met with industry leaders who are pushing for comparable assistance to what American farmers have received since the trade war began.  But the Department of Commerce indicated it has no procedure for distributing such aid, according to the WSJ. “There is no question that these tariffs have virtually destroyed a segment of our industry,” said Steven Anthony, president of Anthony Timberlands. What's next: The Journal said some companies are pushing U.S. buyers to purchase more hardwood products to make up for the losses. Jim Hourdequin, CEO of Lyme Timber Co., presented an idea: A marketing push similar to the ""Got Milk?"" ads that the dairy industry famously produced in the 1990s.

2223431,YOUR MONEY-U.S. tax reform further complicates federal student aid form,"NEW YORK, Oct 3 (Reuters) - U.S. tax reform is finally catching up with the college financial aid process, and the synchronization is off to a rocky start. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for the 2010-2021 academic year became available on Oct. 1. This form, the first since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act went into effect, requires information from 2018 tax returns. Tax law changes figure into the calculation of the Expected Family Contribution, which is the all-important bottom line amount colleges want families to pay toward tuition. Six new schedules are incorporated into the main 1040 tax form, while the 1040EZ and 1040A forms have been eliminated. Tax data can be culled electronically to the FAFSA through the IRS's Data Retrieval Tool if applicants sign up for that process. However, the system does not pull in the schedules, particularly Schedule 1, which lists items like capital gains, unemployment payments, student loan interest paid or the teachers' deduction for supplies. Instead, there are prompts asking if you filed that form. The FAFSA system does not alert you if any schedules are skipped, said Charlie Javice, the founder and chief executive of Frank Financial Aid, a free app that helps students file the FAFSA. ""You could be providing half the information, and nobody is telling you if it's accurate or not,"" said Javice. The risk is that students could miss out on aid because certain income and deductions are not counted. They could make math mistakes when inputting the data by hand, or their applications could be incomplete, resulting in a laborious verification process. Families tend to give up when the process gets too cumbersome, Javice said. ""If normally you'd qualify for a variety of financial aid benefits, and this change puts it at risk, you may want to run that by somebody,"" said Eric Bronnenkant, head of tax at Betterment. HOOPS FOR LOW-INCOME STUDENTS The forms 1040EZ and 1040A used to automatically qualify low-income students for an Auto-Zero Expected Contribution or the Simplified Needs Test. The Department of Education said the added Schedule 1 question serves this purpose. But in August, 10 senators sent a public letter to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos seeking clarification (https://bit.ly/30HMvsd). ""We are concerned that mistaken answers to this complicated question could lead to eligible students losing access,"" they wrote. A spokesman for the Education Department responded to Reuters that the changes to the tax law have not affected the function of the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. The IRS did not respond to a request for comment. What is the best way for families filing the FAFSA form? Either use the IRS tool and try to verify that schools receive the pertinent information, or not use the tool and enter all their information manually, experts advised. Javice chose the latter. The Frank app scans the tax forms of applicants and extracts tax information. Skipping the IRS tool is risky because you are more likely to be selected for the verification process, which is lengthy and time-consuming, warned college finance expert Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of savingforcollege.com. ""The data retrieval tool has always had issues,"" Kantrowitz said. For low-income students, the new tax structure just makes things more complicated. ""It's a big step backwards in terms of college access,"" Javice said.

2229496,Dollar rises vs. yen on trade deal hopes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose to a one-week high against the safe-haven Japanese yen on Wednesday on revived hopes for an amicable resolution to the U.S.-Chinese trade war, after a report that China is still open to agreeing to a partial trade deal with the United States. The report, from Bloomberg, cited an official with direct knowledge of the trade talks. It comes a day after trade tensions flared again after the U.S. State Department said it has imposed visa restrictions on Chinese government and Communist Party officials it believes responsible for the detention or abuse of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province. Separately, the Financial Times newspaper reported that Chinese officials are offering to increase annual purchases of U.S. agricultural products as the two countries seek to resolve their trade dispute. Vice Premier Liu He, China’s top trade negotiator, is scheduled to travel to Washington for their next round of trade talks on Thursday and Friday. “Risk appetite is definitely alive and well,” said Alfonso Esparza, senior currency analyst at OANDA in Toronto. Against the yen, which tends to strengthen during times of geopolitical stress due to Japan’s standing as the world’s biggest creditor, the greenback was 0.43% higher at 107.53 yen. The greenback climbed 0.3% against the Swiss franc, another currency investors deem a safe haven. Still, some analysts advocated caution on the latest bout of optimism around the U.S.-China trade talks. “The Trump administration’s decision to impose visa bans on Chinese officials linked to abuses, blacklist some Chinese high tech companies and a ban on U.S. pension funds investing in China hardly make for a positive backdrop to the trade talks, especially considering that China has yet to respond to the U.S. moves,” said Shaun Osborne, chief market strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies, was about flat on the day. Most Federal Reserve policymakers supported the need for an interest rate cut in September, minutes of the central bank’s last policy meeting showed, but they remain increasingly divided on the path ahead for monetary policy. “It was very neutral. You can still see the divide between the hawks and the doves,” Esparza said. “They are in somewhat agreement that the U.S. economy is growing. It’s just what comes next, where the two differ,” he said. Meanwhile, sterling erased earlier gains on Wednesday after the Northern Irish party that supports the British government said it would emphatically oppose a reported European Union concession on the Irish backstop under any Brexit deal.

2235261,How the Drug War Blob Took Over The Washington Post,"For more than two
years, The Washington Post has
relentlessly pursued the story of how a combination of corporate greed and government inaction
fueled the deadliest drug overdose epidemic in recorded history. The causes and
conditions of this massive—not to mention preventable—death toll are ripe
terrain for a Pulitzer Prize–winning team of investigative journalists with a
knack for data and science, who can also navigate the bureaucratic morass of
government agencies that, in theory, should have sprung into action to tackle
this unprecedented crisis. The Post’s latest reporting has zoomed in on the ways in which
President Obama, President Trump, and Congress failed to contain wave after
wave of overdose deaths. A March 2019 investigation into Obama’s administration, titled
“The Fentanyl Failure,”
was the first hit in a series that revealed that the government had fallen down
on the job: “Despite mounting deaths and warnings,” the reporters wrote, “the
Obama administration did not take extraordinary measures to confront an
extraordinary crisis.”  Two months later, the
opioid team ran a lengthy piece, “Fighting Fentanyl,”
that declared, “Trump called the opioid epidemic a priority, but fentanyl
deaths soar as resources fail to keep pace.” Then, in September, the Post’s third article ran, this one
focused on Congress’s inaction. “Flailing on Fentanyl,” another exhaustive, well-sourced investigation, concluded, “Congress failed to act despite dire warnings about the powerful
opioid.” Members of Congress, consultants, career staffers, and legislative
experts across the Beltway spelled out how powerful people elected to serve
their constituents allowed the problem to metastasize. But what, precisely,
did all these powerful people and agencies fail to
do? What “extraordinary measures” weren’t taken?  The policy
prescriptions in all three Post articles
overwhelmingly favor a narrow set of discredited actions, illustrating how
conventional wisdom in Washington has perpetuated a dubious War on Drugs
approach to addiction that hurts more than it helps. The same way a foreign
policy blob of well-paid consultants, think tanks, and entrenched bureaucrats
have trapped America in fruitless forever wars, the sources given credence in
the Post’s opioid investigations
inadvertently expose a fossilized drug policy consensus, one that goes back to
the days when Richard Nixon declared “drug abuse” public enemy No. 1.  According to the Post, the failures run in just one
direction: The Drug War was not enforced hard enough. And it’s the deadest of
ends. For example: During the Obama administration, the authors
wrote, “U.S. Customs and Border Protection didn’t have enough officers,
properly trained dogs, or sophisticated equipment to curb illegal fentanyl
shipments entering the country from China and Mexico.” Later in the piece,
former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein bemoaned “a dramatic decline in
drug prosecutions” under Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder. “That was a
reflection of administration policy to de-emphasize imprisonment and to shift
focus away from prosecution into treatment,” Rosenstein told the Post.  Even nominally prioritizing calls for more treatment over
enforcement and incarceration is a bridge too far within the Drug War blob.
What went unmentioned in the article is the fact that state imprisonment rates do not correlate in
any meaningful way with drug use and overdose deaths; other studies have shown that incarceration itself is
actually a driver of overdose deaths.
People with an opioid use disorder exiting correctional settings are at a 40 to 130 times higher
risk
of fatally overdosing than the general population. The very policy solution
being called for is actually what’s causing so many unnecessary deaths.  In the same piece, a former NYPD narcotics cop named
Dominick Capuano also blamed Holder for prosecutors’ lack of interest in
pursuing “low-level” drug cases, which Capuano claimed led to a morale problem
among cops enforcing the Drug War. “The low-lying fish is where you start the
cases,” Capuano told the Post. “Those
are the people who flip, who give information, and that’s what leads to these
bigger cases.” Regina LaBelle, former chief of staff at the Office of
National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) under Obama, says she understands the
criticisms about the Obama administration’s lackluster response to overdose
deaths. “But I don’t agree that the policy response should have been shifted to
more of a punitive response, like an increase in sentencing,” LaBelle told me.
Instead, she emphasized that a lack of quality addiction treatment in the U.S.
remains a major factor driving the crisis, not that more arrests aren’t being
made. The Post’s
enforcement frame, applied to Obama, was peculiarly also applied to Trump’s
“failure to act,” despite the fact that his first attorney general was Jeff
Sessions, whom experts in drug policy called a “Drug War dinosaur.” In one of Sessions’s first major speeches in his new post, he emphasized a
tough-on-crime, border enforcement strategy to the overdose crisis, while
quixotically promoting debunked “Just Say No” drug education strategies. “In the
’80s and ’90s, we saw how campaigns stressing prevention brought down drug use
and addiction,” he said. “We can do this again.” You can accuse the Trump
administration of lots of things, but you cannot say they are “soft on
drugs.”  Meanwhile, as deputy attorney general, Rosenstein promised to sue any
programs
that attempted to open facilities allowing people to inject drugs under medical
supervision, called supervised consumption sites. More than 100 such facilities
operate successfully
across
Western Europe, Canada, and Australia. During an unprecedented rise in drug
deaths, the blob won’t even flirt with new public health–focused approaches. The Washington Post, for its part,
neglects to open the door for innovative harm reduction strategies that go
against the Beltway drug enforcement consensus. In contrast, the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation published a piece last June declaring that British
Columbia’s death toll would be
double
what it is today without harm reduction. The term “harm reduction” is part of a paradigm of pragmatic
strategies aimed at keeping people who use drugs alive. It does not appear once
in any of the Post’s three
investigations. When reporting about Obama’s inaction, the Post did not mention that his administration lifted an absurd rule that prevented federal funding for
syringe-access programs, but that when the House flipped back to Republican
control, the ban was reinstated. (After a massive HIV outbreak in rural
Indiana, Republicans partially lifted the
ban.) Other efforts, like doctors fighting to remove onerous
barriers
that prevent people from accessing life-saving medications like methadone and
buprenorphine, also go unmentioned. During the ’90s, when France implemented
what’s called a “low threshold model” that allowed any physician to prescribe
buprenorphine on-demand, the overdose death rate
plunged by 79 percent. Such a policy should be seriously considered stateside,
but unfortunately not by any sources quoted by the Post.  Which brings us to Congress. What, precisely, did Congress
fail to do, aside from put communities at risk of HIV and Hep C by defunding
syringe programs? The investigation spells out how Congress neglected to fully
fund programs to the tune of many billions of dollars that experts like LaBelle
argue are needed to rebuild America’s crumbling treatment infrastructure.
Indeed, that’s a massive failure for which Congress is solely responsible. But
other actions Congress failed to take, per the Post, involve bills collecting dust that would put sanctions on
China, Mexico, and other countries that “aren’t cooperating with U.S. efforts
to outlaw fentanyl.” Highlighting bills that would sanction countries that source
America’s demand for drugs illustrates the boundaries of what’s possible in
drug policy. America has long flexed its Drug War muscles in countries like
Colombia and Mexico by providing billions of
dollars in military aid. For example, the DEA helped orchestrate the assassination
of Pablo Escobar and the eventual capture, prosecution, and conviction of
Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. But America has no authority to fly attack
helicopters into China, raid labs manufacturing fentanyl, or assassinate rogue
chemists. The force of America’s global Drug War stops at China’s door, where the preferred strong arm of
enforcement gives way to the soft arm of diplomacy. Given Trump’s so-called trade war with China, the diplomatic route seems to be going nowhere
fast. And of course, the flow of illicit drugs into the U.S. from
Mexico did not stop after Guzmán’s capture. America’s presence in Colombia has
also imploded in spectacular fashion. According to the United Nations, in
recent years cocaine production in Colombia has hit new records.  “Countries that source America’s drug supply have been telling
us the same thing for decades,” says Dan Ciccarone, a physician-researcher at
the University of California in San Francisco who studies illicit drug
supplies: “‘Deal with your [drug] problem, folks.’” Other countries around the
world do not see the same astonishing rise in overdose deaths that occurs in
the U.S. “Fun-loving, pleasure-seeking countries around the world do not have a
drug problem as severe as ours is,” Ciccarone said. “And
they all have rational drug policies: demand reduction and harm reduction, and
we just haven’t done it.”  Focused on extending America’s global drug war and punishing
countries that produce drugs, no Congress member quoted by the Post seemed curious to understand why Americans have an insatiable demand for
substances that relieve pain stemming from trauma, economic hardship, and
deteriorating living conditions. These politicians are witnessing an
unprecedented decline in health among swaths of people in Appalachia, the
Midwest, and New England—areas where free-trade policies
caused factories to close and manufacturing jobs to disappear, putting the
possibility of living a comfortable middle-class life out of reach. Researchers recently linked free-trade
policies
to a rise in overdose deaths. For every 1,000 people who lost jobs due to
free-trade policies that caused manufacturing jobs to disappear, there was an
11.3 percent jump in overdose deaths.    “People will say, ‘What’s the evidence for demand
reduction?’ Well, why don’t we just give it a serious effort? Why don’t we fund
a one- or two-generation serious effort like we’ve done with supply reduction?”
Ciccarone asked. “Let’s work on community resilience, let’s work on individual
resilience, let’s work on treatment and harm reduction to see whether it
works.” Ciccarone’s plea for a new drug policy paradigm is anathema to the square-jawed enforcers among Washington’s consultant class.
Take, for instance, John Walters and David Murray, both of whom currently work
at the conservative Hudson Institute in Washington. The duo were appointed to
the ONDCP by President George W. Bush. They’re the authors of hits like “Kill All the Poppies,” a piece of pure hubris published
in Foreign Policy that represents the
Drug War at its most belligerent: crop eradication, crippling local economies,
and cajoling other countries to stop feeding our drug habit. Walters, who was frequently lambasted in his role as Bush’s drug czar for
hiding from the press, was quoted in two out of the three Washington Post investigations. And the Post has also recently given a platform to Murray, who worked as
“chief scientist” under Walters at ONDCP.  During a 2018 Washington Post forum, the moderator asked Murray what
could go wrong with harm reduction. Murray’s response perfectly foreshadowed
how the Post framed its opioid
investigations: “I’m worried that we’re neglecting one of the critical tools
here. ... If you’re not reducing the supply and availability [of drugs], you’re not
enabling people to have incentives to move into treatment.” The Walters and Murray theory of muscular drug enforcement
has been the consensus in Washington for decades. And it clearly hasn’t worked,
though you wouldn’t know that from the Post.
“That’s what this is, a failure of imagination,” Ciccarone says. “We haven’t
tried a new paradigm, and that’s the real failure.”  Zachary Siegel is a writer based in Chicago. His work has appeared in The New York Times Magazine, The Atlantic, Slate, and WIRED, among others.",3.5
2241014,Anger in Catalonia over harsh sentences for separtists,"Spain’s supreme court today sentenced 9 Catalan politicians to between 9 and 13 years for their roles in an unauthorized 2017 independence referendum. The latest: Protestors outraged by the severe sentences for sedition and misuse of public funds filled the streets in cities across the semi-autonomous region and flooded into Barcelona’s airport, causing more than 100 flight cancellations. The trial of 12 separatist leaders, 3 of whom were convicted today of lesser charges, captivated Spain. The verdict comes ahead of a general election next month — the 4th in 4 years. What’s next: Asked where the independence movement goes from here, Catalonia’s secretary for foreign affairs, Mireia Borrell Porta, says the Catalan government continues to push for dialogue with Madrid, but “right now there’s no one at the other side of the table.” Pedro Sánchez, the center-left prime minister, has been “unable and unwilling to solve this issue,"" she says. He's distanced himself from the separatists since they helped him gain power. “I think the verdict has shown that Spain is really not a well-functioning democracy,” she argues. Asked why what she calls a clear ""violation of fundamental rights"" hasn’t generated backlash from countries across Europe, she says:",5.0
2243582,Study: California fault that could produce massive quake moves for first time | TheHill,"A California fault that could produce a massive earthquake started moving for the first time following earthquakes near Ridgecrest, Calif., this summer, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science. The study found that about 20 faults created the Ridgecrest earthquake sequence, USA Today reports.   ""We really have to remind ourselves that California is earthquake country,"" Ross said. ""So, it's not just thinking about the largest, most damaging potential scenarios like events on the San Andreas, but remembering that there's a potential for hazard pretty much all over the place.""  The 7.1 magnitude earthquake near Ridgecrest in July was the largest to hit Southern California in at least 20 years. It was followed one day later by a 6.4 magnitude quake that shook the same area.  The study found that the fault could produce a 8.0 magnitude earthquake, USA Today reports. Ross told the newspaper it has yet to be determined how the movement could affect the danger of future earthquakes.  The study was published the same day that California released an earthquake early warning app, USA Today notes.  In addition to sending earthquake alerts, the app uses phones “like a mini seismometer” to detect quakes and record data, according to app’s website.

2252780,"What’s a World Cup Title Worth? For U.S. Women, Six Figures and Counting","United States players collected about $250,000 in bonuses for winning another world championship, but additional paydays are growing in real time. What is winning the World Cup title worth to the United States women’s soccer team? In one sense, the answer is incalculable: an achievement no critic can take away, a tangible reward for years of training and preparation, a validation of a life’s work. A dozen members of the United States women’s soccer team already knew this feeling; they were part of the team that lifted the trophy in 2015. Now they are letting it wash over them again. [The United States beat a tenacious Netherlands on Sunday to win their record fourth World Cup title.] But there also is a more dispassionate, strictly dollars-and-cents calculation of the championship’s value for every member of the team that beat the Netherlands on Sunday. That math — some if it contracted and fixed, some of it speculative and growing day by day — is quite different. In the strictest sense, a United States women’s player will receive a guaranteed payday of about $250,000 for qualifying for the World Cup, making the final roster and then winning the tournament, based on enhanced bonuses included in the team’s collective bargaining agreement with U.S. Soccer and a payout schedule for the finishers published by FIFA earlier this year. (Those FIFA bonus figures continue to pale in comparison to the far larger payouts for teams who compete in the men’s World Cup; France’s men, for example, split $38 million for winning the men’s tournament in Russia last summer. Those payments, and comparisons to FIFA-fueled payouts to the United States men’s team after its participation in recent World Cups, are part of a broader and perpetually contentious debate about pay equality for women’s soccer.) Their contracts with U.S. Soccer paint a specific picture of how the money breaks down. Qualifying and roster bonuses: Every member of the United States team that qualified for the World Cup in October earned a bonus of $37,500. Every player subsequently named to the World Cup roster picked up an additional bonus of $37,500. That means most of the squad had pocketed $75,000 before any of them set foot in France last month. Victory bonus: FIFA pays $4 million to the winner of the Women’s World Cup (the runner-up gets $2.6 million), money sent directly to the winning federation. U.S. Soccer, as it does with the men’s team, funnels the bulk of that money back to the players who won it: this year, that means each member of the U.S. team can expect a winning share between $110,000 and $120,000. Victory tour: A first-place finish also triggers a four-game victory tour in the women’s team’s collective bargaining agreement with U.S. Soccer, with each player guaranteed just over $60,000 to take part. If the team and the federation mutually agree to add more games, players can expect a proportional bump of about $15,000 for each match. The total of all those payments? Roughly $250,000 per player. And that is before other sweeteners in the players’ contracts like attendance and ratings bonuses likely to be triggered by a successful victory tour in the United States after the World Cup, not to mention side deals with personal sponsors like Nike and Adidas and friendly companies like Luna Bar. Of course, the carry-on effects of a championship are not limited to payments from U.S. Soccer. When the women’s team negotiated its current agreement, which set base salaries, match bonuses and working conditions, it also carved out some marketing rights that in previous decades had either been granted to the federation or merely left unexplored. Those have proved to be quite valuable. When the agreement was ratified in 2017, the team benefited from only two group licensing agreements — with EA Sports, for its FIFA video game, and Panini, the trading card maker. Now there are more than 25 such deals, for products as diverse as T-shirts and socks to bobbleheads and toys. Jersey customizations alone can mean thousands of dollars in extra income for top players. The other licensing payments go into a pool that is split equally by each member of the team. Even before the Americans won the World Cup final on Sunday, the president of REP Worldwide, the sports marketing company the players’ union formed with its counterparts from the N.F.L. and the W.N.B.A., estimated the potential for at least $1 million in new licensing revenue — another five-figure income boost for each player — over the next year. “We’re expanding the pie, which was the whole point,” the union’s executive director, Becca Roux, said in an interview Sunday morning. “This was never a zero-sum game.” The players soon could be in position to test their own value even further. Top European clubs like Manchester City, Barcelona and Bayern Munich have made significant investments in women’s soccer in the last decade, and powerhouses like Juventus, Manchester United and Real Madrid have done the same just in the last two years. Their new interest could drive up club salaries and other marketing opportunities for top women’s players, and after next summer’s Tokyo Olympics — which brings the promise of at least $50,000 more in U.S. Soccer bonuses for those who play — the best Americans could be positioned to cash in on their value in that rapidly expanding women’s soccer marketplace. And the pie Roux described soon may grow even larger. FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, raved about the success of this year’s World Cup during his end-of-tournament news conference on Friday. Thrilled by record television ratings in some major countries and large, enthusiastic crowds inside World Cup stadiums, he said he would propose doubling the prize money in time for the next edition of the tournament in 2023.",4.0
2253643,Así han evolucionado las protestas en Hong Kong,"Asia Las manifestaciones en Hong Kong se han caracterizado por tácticas y objetivos cambiantes y una violencia cada vez más frecuente. Te explicamos por qué sucedió esto. HONG KONG — Las protestas que han sacudido Hong Kong este verano comenzaron con una inmensa manifestación a inicios de junio en contra de un proyecto de ley impopular. Desde entonces, se han convertido en un movimiento más amplio en contra del poder de Pekín en este territorio semiautónomo. Durante varias semanas, se han vuelto más frecuentes los choques violentos entre jóvenes manifestantes y la policía, y las exigencias de los manifestantes se han vuelto más diversas y ambiciosas. Los activistas han tomado oficinas gubernamentales, han detenido el transporte público y han hecho pintas sobre símbolos de la autoridad de China. Además, el uso de la fuerza policiaca en contra de los manifestantes, junto con el fracaso para evitar un ataque multitudinario a pasajeros del metro, ha hecho que la conducta de los policías sea un tema central. A continuación, presentamos una guía sobre qué detonó las protestas, cómo evolucionaron y por qué es relevante. Hong Kong, un centro financiero internacional ubicado en la costa sur de China, fue una colonia británica hasta 1997, cuando devolvieron la ciudad a China conforme a una política conocida como “un país, dos sistemas”. La política hizo que Hong Kong fuera parte de China, pero le permitió mantener muchas libertades que se les niegan a los ciudadanos en el continente, entre ellas la libertad de expresión, el acceso sin restricciones a internet y el derecho de reunión. El territorio tiene sus propias leyes, su sistema de gobierno y su fuerza policial, todo lo cual se encuentra bajo una miniconstitución conocida como la Ley Básica. China prometió que este sistema iba a permanecer hasta 2047, por lo menos. Sin embargo, muchos hongkoneses sienten que Pekín ya está socavando su autonomía y que el gobierno local obedece sus órdenes. Un comité pro-Pekín es el encargado de nombrar al máximo líder del territorio, el jefe ejecutivo: en la actualidad, la lideresa Carrie Lam. Además, el aparato de seguridad de China ha realizado intrusiones problemáticas en el territorio de Hong Kong, entre ellas el secuestro de vendedores de libros y de un multimillonario nacido en China. En febrero, el gobierno local presentó un proyecto de ley en la legislatura de Hong Kong —que está llena de legisladores pro-China—. Dicho proyecto permitiría que la gente acusada de algún crimen fuera enviada a lugares con los cuales Hong Kong no tiene un tratado de extradición, incluida China continental, donde los tribunales están bajo el control del Partido Comunista. Lam, la jefa ejecutiva, arguyó que el proyecto de ley era necesario a fin de garantizar la justicia para las víctimas. Lam mencionó que la ley se propuso por el caso de un hombre acusado de asesinar a su novia en Taiwán que luego evadió la justicia huyendo a Hong Kong. Los críticos aseguran que el proyecto de ley permitirá que Pekín detenga a disidentes en Hong Kong por cargos falsos. El 9 de junio, cientos de miles de personas, entre ellas gente de la tercera edad y familias con hijos, se unieron a una marcha para oponerse al proyecto de ley. El 12 de junio, el debate y las exigencias cambiaron, cuando la policía utilizó gas pimienta, garrotes y más de 150 latas de gas lacrimógeno para dispersar a miles de manifestantes, de entre los cuales una pequeña cantidad había lanzado proyectiles a la policía. La violencia aumentó la presión sobre Lam, quien el 15 de junio suspendió la ley de extradición y, posteriormente, dijo que el proyecto estaba “muerto”. Sin embargo, se rehusó a abandonarlo por completo. Los manifestantes la consideran una acción a medias y han insistido en la retirada formal del proyecto de ley, así como la renuncia de Lam y una investigación en torno al uso de la fuerza policial. Impulsados por la furia en contra de la policía, así como por la lenta erosión de las libertades civiles, las protestas, que en general no tienen líderes, se han transformado en un movimiento más generalizado y complicado: sobre la protección de las libertades, la democracia y la autonomía de Hong Kong. Las manifestaciones han continuado y la mayoría de los participantes han actuado sin violencia. Una marcha pacífica celebrada el 6 de junio fue la más grande en la historia de Hong Kong: se calcula una participación de hasta dos millones de personas. No obstante, los choques entre la policía y jóvenes manifestantes vestidos con cascos, máscaras y camisetas negras han escalado de forma dramática. En julio, cientos de manifestantes tomaron el edificio del Consejo Legislativo, lo ocuparon durante horas y lo vandalizaron. Más tarde ese mismo mes, manifestantes realizaron pintas sobre el emblema nacional de China ubicado en la oficina principal del gobierno central en la ciudad. Esa noche, una multitud de más de cien hombres armados con varas atacó a manifestantes y transeúntes en una estación de metro, donde lesionaron a decenas. La policía llegó tarde y en un inicio no arrestó a nadie; algunas de las personas que fueron arrestadas después al parecer tienen vínculos con grupos del crimen organizado conocidos como triadas. El episodio impactó a la ciudad y da la impresión de haber profundizado la ira en contra de la policía, pues se le acusa de permitir el ataque. Los manifestantes se han vuelto más fluidos en sus tácticas, al moverse de un lugar a otro por toda la ciudad (“Sé agua”, una frase del difunto actor hongkonés Bruce Lee, se ha convertido en una consigna). Han rodeado estaciones de la policía, han lanzado ladrillos y han empezado incendios, y la policía ha redoblado el uso de gas lacrimógeno. El 5 de agosto, los manifestantes realizaron protestas en varias partes de la ciudad, bloquearon trenes y caminos, e hicieron un llamado a la gente de Hong Kong para que se quedara en su casa después del trabajo, lo cual aparentemente ocurrió. Pekín ha respaldado a Lam y poco a poco ha aumentado sus advertencias hacia los manifestantes. Sin embargo, los funcionarios chinos en su mayoría le han dejado a Lam la responsabilidad de sofocar los disturbios. Lam se ha negado a hacer más concesiones desde que suspendió la ley de extradición y parece sentirse confiada en que su gobierno puede soportar el descontento. El 5 de agosto, Lam acusó a los manifestantes de desafiar al gobierno chino al decir que “quieren derrocar a Hong Kong, destruir por completo el modo de vida que aprecian siete millones de personas”. Lam mencionó que el movimiento podía llevar a la ciudad “al borde de una situación muy peligrosa”. Un día después, Yang Guang, un funcionario de la oficina de vinculación con Hong Kong en Pekín, realizó la advertencia más grave de China: “Quiero advertir a todos los criminales que no juzguen la situación de una manera equivocada y que no piensen que nuestro control es una debilidad”. Un “golpe de la espada de la ley les está esperando en el futuro”, expresó. Sin embargo, Yang no dijo cómo Hong Kong o China podrían resolver la crisis. Aunque en julio el ejército chino insinuó que estaba listo para intervenir, funcionarios locales han negado que hubieran planeado solicitar una intervención militar, que está permitida por la Ley Básica. El presidente Xi Jinping se ha abstenido de comentar en público sobre la crisis. La policía ha arrestado a cientos de personas, los activistas también han exigido que se liberen a los prisioneros, y el ciclo de protestas, choques y alteración no tiene un fin claro a la vista.

2253756,Body of Michigan Man Deported to Iraq Is Returned to the U.S.,"Jimmy Aldaoud died in Baghdad of a “diabetic crisis” after his deportation. His funeral is scheduled for next week. A coffin arrived in Detroit from Iraq on Friday with the remains of 41-year-old Jimmy Aldaoud, whose death this month prompted bipartisan efforts to curb the Trump administration’s deportation of Iraqi nationals. Mr. Aldaoud, whose parents were Iraqi, was born in a refugee camp in Greece, entered the United States legally in 1979 when he was 6 months old and grew up in the Detroit area. His life was unsettled: He battled depression and diabetes and also had bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. He was in and out of jail, with at least 20 criminal convictions over the past two decades, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. After being arrested on a larceny charge, he was deported to Iraq on June 2 with very little insulin, no money and no knowledge of Arabic. His sisters did not know he had been deported until he called from the city of Najaf. Mr. Aldaoud was found dead in a Baghdad apartment on Aug. 6 after days of vomiting blood and begging to return to the United States. He died of a “diabetic crisis,” according to Representative Andy Levin, a Democrat who represents the Michigan district where Mr. Aldaoud used to live. “Jimmy was a sweet person with a good heart,” Mr. Aldaoud’s sisters said in a statement. “We hope Jimmy’s story opens people’s eyes and hearts to understanding that we should not be deporting people to their death overseas.” Mr. Levin coordinated with government officials and funeral homes in Iraq and Michigan to secure the return of Mr. Aldaoud’s remains. A private funeral will take place next week for Mr. Aldaoud, who was a Chaldean Catholic. The Chaldean Community Foundation, a social services organization based in Michigan, paid for his remains to be transported to the United States. In December 2018, a federal appeals court overturned a judge’s decision to block the Trump administration’s push to deport Iraqi nationals, like Mr. Aldaoud (whose name is sometimes spelled Al-Daoud), Mr. Levin wrote in a USA Today op-ed. Michigan’s 9th District, the region Mr. Levin represents, has the largest Iraqi-born community of any congressional district in the country, according to census data. “Jimmy’s death was an avoidable, unnecessary and predictable tragedy,” Mr. Levin said in a statement. “My only hope is that Jimmy’s family feels some sense of relief now that his body can be buried in his home country, next to his mother.” In April, just days before ICE could begin a mass removal of Iraqi nationals, Mr. Levin sent a letter signed by 20 lawmakers to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE requesting a halt to the deportations. The next month, Mr. Levin and John Moolenaar, a Republican representative from Michigan, introduced a bipartisan bill that would provide Iraqi nationals with two years of relief from deportation and ensure each of their cases could be heard individually in immigration court. Then in late June, three weeks after Mr. Aldaoud was deported, Mr. Levin and Mr. Moolenaar sent a letter to Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, seeking help on behalf of Iraqi nationals living in the United States, including Chaldean Christians and other religious and ethnic minorities. “Unfortunately, I believe we can expect to learn of more stories like Jimmy’s if deportations of vulnerable Iraqi nationals continue,” Mr. Levin said.

2259636,"Kashmir, Notre-Dame, Saudi Aramco: Your Monday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. We’re covering at the latest threat in Kashmir, the toxic fallout from the Notre-Dame fire and mass weddings in the Middle East. Eyes are on oil as markets open for the week, but this much is clear: Drone attacks on two Saudi Aramco facilities could raise prices. Rapid Saudi repairs could minimize global disruptions. The Trump administration used the attacks, which were claimed by Houthi rebels in Yemen, to lash out against Iran. Iran forcefully rejected that charge. The finger-pointing adds to rising tensions between Tehran and Washington. Reminder: The Houthis are part of a complex regional dynamic in the Middle East. The rebel force receives support from Iran in its fight against a Saudi-backed coalition that is aligned with the U.S. Here’s how the conflict turned into the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. The Indian government has started to lift some of the restrictions that it imposed in Kashmir last month, as it wiped out the region’s autonomy. But now a small band of militant separatists have started enforcing their own restrictions, ordering people not to go to work or even leave their homes in an effort to keep Kashmir paralyzed and tense. Some threaten or attack civilians — in one case shooting a 5-year-old girl. Takeaway: The separatists’ campaign exposes Kashmiri residents, who have already complained about torture and abuse at the hands of Indian security forces, to yet another violent force. Context: The restive region has seen similar cycles in the past, with insurgents repeatedly rising up against Indian rule and trapping residents in a constant state of fear. Perspective: One writer, Priyanka Mattoo, lost her home in Kashmir in a separatist uprising in 1989, and has never gone back. “It is now a pile of rubble, I think,” she writes in an Op-Ed. “The roof was burned off by militants, and snow seeped in to dissolve the rest.” An estimated 60 percent of the thousands of North Korean women smuggled into China end up trapped in the sex trade. Promised job opportunities, they are instead sold to pimps who increasingly force them to work in cybersex dens. If they try to escape, they are sent back to North Korea, where they face torture and incarceration in labor camps. Case study: Lee Jin-hui, 20, said she had left North Korea in 2017 for what she thought was a waitressing job in China. But for more than two years, she was forced to perform sex acts before a webcam, all day, every day, bringing in $820 a week for her pimp. She said she was never allowed to leave her apartment and was beaten and denied food if she failed to make enough money. She and a fellow captive fled to Laos in August with the help of a Christian pastor from South Korea. The fire in April that engulfed the roof and spire of Paris’s 850-year-old cathedral set off a public health crisis: Lead that burned to dust settled in city schools, parks and other public places. More than 6,000 children, who are most vulnerable to damage from lead, may have been exposed. A Times investigation found that though authorities knew about lead contamination, their response has been halting. It took city officials a month to conduct the first lead tests at a school close to Notre-Dame and, even today, not every school near the cathedral has been tested. How we know: Our reporters looked at confidential documents, including warnings by labor inspectors, a police report and previously undisclosed lead measurements by the Culture Ministry, and conducted scores of interviews. Traveling to Paris? Most experts recommend staying away from the immediate vicinity of the cathedral, particularly if you have children. We have more tips here. In Lebanon and across the Mideast, marriage remains highly valued but economic pressures have turned weddings into costly burdens. So powerful brokers have stepped in from militant groups, political parties and even among government officials to bankroll large-scale ceremonies in which dozens — sometimes even hundreds — of couples tie the knot. General Motors: With little progress in contract talks, the United Automobile Workers union called for nearly 50,000 workers to walk off the job within hours, the first such strike since 2007. Brett Kavanaugh: An essay in the Opinion section of The New York Times revealed new information about allegations of youthful sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court justice, reviving the partisan battle over his confirmation. Iraq: Surging addiction to illegal drugs, mostly crystal meth, is concentrated in Basra and Baghdad, where community leaders and government officials seem unprepared and ill-equipped to deal with the issue. Hong Kong: Protesters hurled gasoline bombs at government offices on Sunday, turning yet another peaceful pro-democracy march violent and highlighting the raw anger that has fueled 15 weeks of demonstrations. China’s U.S. business: The state-owned company CRRC Corporation, the world’s largest train maker, built a $100 million factory in Chicago in hopes of meeting U.S. demand for subway cars and passenger trains. But Congress is expected to pass legislation soon that would effectively bar the company from competing for U.S. contracts on national security and economic grounds. Boeing: A committee of the company’s board is expected to recommend a slew of reforms, according to three people briefed on the matter. It’s Boeing’s most direct effort to make aircraft design and production safer since two deadly crashes of its 737 Max jets. Snapshot: Above, an 18-karat gold toilet titled “America” that was stolen over the weekend from an art exhibit at Blenheim Palace, the Oxfordshire birthplace and family home of Winston Churchill. “I want to be positive and think the robbery is a kind of Robin Hood-inspired action,” said the artist, Maurizio Cattelan.

Twenty teams lifted off in gas balloons from Montbéliard in eastern France on Friday night to see which could go the farthest without stopping. Some of these adventurers are still flying. In fact, the competition in the Gordon Bennett Cup could go on for another day or so. The race is named for James Gordon Bennett Jr., playboy and heir to The New York Herald, who started the race in 1906 while he ran the newspaper’s Paris edition. The event can be perilous. In 2010, the U.S. team disappeared during a storm over the Adriatic Sea. In 1995, a U.S. balloon crossed into Belarus air space and was shot down by the military. This year’s race is going well. Australia’s team — Dariusz Brzozowski and Christopher Saunders — has the lead as of this writing. They caught a wind that took them nearly due west for 640.48 kilometers (about 398 miles), landing near Nantes just after noon local time on Sunday. Last year’s winner, a team from Poland, traveled almost twice that. The distance record is 2,100 miles, set in 2005. That’s it for this briefing.

TO BUILD A BETTER WORLD Choices to End the Cold War and Create a Global Commonwealth By Philip Zelikow and Condoleezza Rice As secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice hung up in her office portraits of George C. Marshall and Dean Acheson, the predecessors who, more than anyone else, built the institutions that governed the international community after World War II. Rice and the president she served, George W. Bush, believed that with the invasion of Iraq, and the aggressive promotion of democracy across the Middle East, they could extend to the Arab world the liberal, democratic order that had sustained peace and prosperity in the West. They turned out to be dreadfully wrong, and neither the United States nor the Middle East has recovered from their reckless experiments. Like Henry Kissinger, Rice is a scholar as well as a diplomat, and thus has additional means to influence the public and shape her own standing. A quarter of a century ago, she and Philip Zelikow, both of whom served as midlevel officials in President George H. W. Bush’s National Security Council, described the virtuoso statecraft that brought the Cold War to a peaceful conclusion in “Germany Unified and Europe Transformed” — a kind of bookend to the world-ordering labors of Marshall and Acheson. In “To Build a Better World” they return to the subject, but with a new sense of urgency, for, as they write, the world seems to be “drifting toward another great systemic crisis.” They would have us regard the end of the Cold War as a parable for our own beleaguered times. Rice and Zelikow make a convincing case that the collapse of the Soviet Union constituted one of history’s rare “catalytic episodes,” when the existing order is convulsed by immense forces that statesmen can shape for good or ill. Had reckless leaders made self-aggrandizing choices, the collapse of a great power could have led to chaos and war. This did not happen, in Rice and Zelikow’s telling, because the chief actors of the drama — the elder President Bush, the German chancellor Helmut Kohl and the Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev — were rational, worldly, pragmatic heads of state. They shared a vision of a common Europe, even if Gorbachev imagined a Communist Soviet Union flourishing alongside the capitalist West. They believed in, and used, the chief institutions of the postwar world, whether NATO or the United Nations. They understood the political limits under which each operated. When he met Gorbachev in late 1989, Bush said: “I have conducted myself in ways not to complicate your life. That’s why I have not jumped up and down on the Berlin Wall.” Gorbachev, under great pressure from traditionalists to keep the Soviet sphere intact, responded that “he had noticed that and appreciated it.” Rice and Zelikow told many of the same stories in their earlier book. But when you read them now, you feel an almost unbearable nostalgia for a time when leaders took risks in the name of a common interest and publics embraced the core values of liberal democracy. Where are the wise men of yesteryear? That, implicitly, is the question Rice and Zelikow pose. But perhaps that’s the wrong question. In retrospect, the end of the Cold War gave birth to an extraordinary, and very brief, moment of consensus in which liberal values appeared to be universal and the institutions of the “liberal world order” seemed poised to operate as their founders had imagined. (In the new world order that George H. W. Bush envisioned, the United Nations Security Council would be empowered to truly enforce the global rule of law.) Peace and prosperity disposed citizens to defer to their leaders, who enjoyed the support needed to make tough decisions. That consensus is gone, along with the deference it fostered. Different times produce different leaders; Americans have lost confidence in self-effacing patricians. (See: Bush, Jeb.) What happened? How did we lose faith in George H. W. Bush’s optimistic vision of American global engagement and sink into the toxic brew of bellicosity and isolationism that Donald Trump now promotes and exploits? Rice and Zelikow blame the economic crisis of 2008 and, incredibly, the preoccupation of the left with “the diversity narrative” rather than with poverty and inequality — blithely skipping over George W. Bush’s huge tax cuts for the rich. But that is hardly the chief omission. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 presented Bush and his national security team with their own “catalytic episode.” They could have closed ranks with allies and worked closely with the United Nations, as the elder Bush and his team had done. They chose a different path, one that ultimately damaged America’s standing in the world and soured the American public on engagement abroad. At that critical juncture, our authors arguably did not practice what they now preach. Rice commissioned Zelikow to rewrite Bush’s 2002 national security report after the State Department produced a version that sounded to her too much like the elder Bush. The Rice/Zelikow version bristled with threats of military action — unilateral, if need be — in the name of principles that are “right and true for every person, in every society.” In the run-up to the war in Iraq, Rice ignored warnings from the same veterans of 1989 whom she praises so lavishly in “To Build a Better World.” And she and Zelikow refer only in passing to the Iraq war, observing with supreme understatement that the results “are still being debated today.” What, one is forced to ask, should be made of a work that is so scrupulous in historical analysis yet so impoverished in critical self-reflection?",4.0
2261664,"What’s Going On in This Graph? | Sept. 25, 2019","The change in the population across the country has varied considerably in the past decade.

Updated: Sept. 26, 2019 This graph appeared in the New York Times article “A ‘Full’ Nation in Dire Need of New Faces.” It is a news analysis that addresses President Trump’s statement that “This country is full.” Is this true? What does “full” mean? How could you measure how full it is? One way could be to track the change over time in the working-age population across the United States. That’s what The New York Times did in creating this heat map, using data for the years 2007- 2017 from the Economic Innovation Group, Moody’s, and the U. S. Census Bureau. The graph shows that nearly half of Americans live in a county where the prime working-age population (ages 25 to 54) shrank over the last decade. Here are some of the student headlines that really capture the meaning of this graph: Laci wrote, “Is America Growing or Shrinking?” Devyn created the headline, “Workers on the Move.” Ava wrote, “It’s a Working World in the United States.” Good noticing and wondering leads to good headlines. You may want to think critically about these additional questions. Why is population growth of working-age individuals good for a region? Similarly, why is population decline of working-age individuals bad for a region? The components of population change are birthrate, death (mortality) rate, and in- and out-migration either from within the United States or from abroad. — Describe how each of these components affect population change? — What actions or circumstances are affecting these components? Which regions of the United States are gaining working age individuals the fastest? What characteristics do they share? Similarly, which regions are losing working age individuals? What characteristics do they share? Compare cities to rural areas in the map. Describe what you notice. What could explain the difference? If a region or city is gaining or losing working-age individuals, what is the effect on the area’s economy? What policies could reverse this trend? Does a 5 percent increase in one area equate to the same number of additional people that would be gained in a 5 percent increase in another area? Let’s look at an example using two Texas cities. Houston has a population of 2,326,000 and Waco has 138,000. Calculate a 5 percent population increase? (Just the increase, not the total population.) — Use what you know about where there are concentrations of population in the United States to compare the size of population changes in various parts of the United States.

A map is a heat map, or choropleth, when ranges of data values are represented by colors. In the population change heat map, the map visually displays the percentage change over the past decade (2007 – 2017) in the working-age (25 – 54 years old) population by U.S. county. Counties that gained population are brown and counties with a loss of population are purple. The darker the color, the greater the change in population. Much of the country has a drop of more than 10 percent in the working-age population. Few counties have an increase of more than 10 percent. PERCENTAGE CHANGE Percentage change is the difference between two values divided by one of the values, sometimes called the baseline. With values from time periods, the baseline is usually the earlier value. This result is multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage. A percentage change is positive if the values are increasing over time, negative if they are decreasing, and zero if there is no change. The farther from zero the percentage change is, the greater the change from the baseline or earlier value. In the population change heat map, the calculation for the percentage change is the county’s 2017 working age population minus the 2007 baseline working age population divided by the 2007 baseline, times 100. These percentage changes are then converted to colors based on the scale, with decreases in population in purples and increases in browns. The darker the color, the greater the change between 2007 and 2017. _________ The graphs for “What’s Going On in This Graph?” are selected in partnership with Sharon Hessney.

2268165,India partially restores mobile phone lines in Kashmir,"SRINAGAR (Reuters) - India restored some mobile phone services in contested Kashmir on Monday, two months after imposing a communications clampdown on the Himalayan region. India stripped its portion of the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley of statehood and autonomy on Aug. 5, cutting internet and phone lines and arresting thousands in an attempt to dampen dissent. The restrictions have gradually been eased. Landlines were restored last month, and an advisory asking tourists to not travel to the region was lifted last week. But the majority of people in the region remain without access to mobile networks or broadband internet connections. Mobile phones taken out on contracts, known in India as “post-paid” plans, were functional across Indian-administered Kashmir on Monday. Pre-paid mobile phones remained restricted. “It is a big relief,” said Javed Ahmed, a Kashmiri in the region’s main city of Srinagar. “At least we can get in touch with our loved ones. But the major issue is the internet shutdown.” The communication restrictions have hit access to healthcare and services and rights groups have been calling for them to be removed. In August, United Nations experts termed the curbs “a form of collective punishment”. “Patients were not able to report to hospital due to the clampdown,” said a psychiatrist at Srinagar’s Shri Maharaja Hari Singh hospital, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media. “We hope they will do now. They missed a lot of sessions of counseling.” Nuclear-armed arch-rivals India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir. Both countries claim the region in full but rule it in part. New Delhi maintains that some restrictions in the region are still required to combat a decades-old insurgency against its rule, which it accuses Pakistan of fomenting. Islamabad denies this, saying it provides only diplomatic and moral support to Kashmiri separatists. Reporting by Fayaz Bukhari in Srinagar; Writing by Alasdair Pal; Editing by Alex Richardson",3.5
2271025,U.S. charges six investment bankers over insider trading scheme,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors said on Tuesday they had charged six members of an insider trading ring who worked for firms including Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N), Moelis and Centerview Partners and allegedly booked tens of millions of dollars in illicit profits. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has arrested three members of the international ring and unsealed four separate indictments in recent days. The bankers and others all booked trading profits off nonpublic information related to deals including acquisitions, the prosecutors said in a statement. They said Benjamin Taylor, formerly an employee of investment banking firm Moelis, and Darina Windsor, a former employee of boutique investment bank Centerview Partners, obtained and leaked nonpublic information about publicly-traded companies to securities dealers. The bankers shared in the profits from the trades beginning in at least January 2013, authorities said in an indictment unsealed on Monday. That included profits from buying shares of biotech firm InterMune Inc ahead of a 2014 announcement of an $8.3 billion acquisition by Roche Holding AG (ROG.S); profits from shares of Onyx Pharmaceuticals before news reports in June 2013 that it would be purchased by Amgen (AMGN.O) for $10.4 billion, and profits off shares of Pharmacyclics ahead of an announcement it would be purchased by AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) for $21 billion in 2015. Windsor and Taylor, who were romantically involved, “repeatedly accessed internal electronic files” of their employees, including files relating to business deals on which they were not involved, the authorities said. A Moelis spokeswoman confirmed Taylor had been a “junior employee.” A Centerview spokesman said Windsor, also a “junior employee,” was terminated nearly four years ago for misconduct. Securities trader Joseph El-Khouri was arrested on Monday in the United Kingdom. He allegedly received leaked information from Windsor and Taylor, which he then passed along to journalists. El-Khouri and an unnamed trader built up long positions in companies targeted for acquisition, court documents said. El-Khouri realized over $2 million in illicit gains trading securities of at least six different companies, according to the documents. Bryan Cohen, a banker who worked for Goldman Sachs, was arrested on Friday. Cohen shared inside information with a securities trader named Georgios Nikas, who is also an owner of a chain of Greek restaurants in New York, prosecutors said. From December 2012 through 2017, Nikas and another trader obtained information from Taylor, Windsor and Cohen, prosecutors said. They said Nikas also received information from Telemaque Lavidas, the son of a member of the board of directors at Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc. Lavidas was arrested on Friday. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a separate statement on Tuesday it had obtained an order freezing Nikas’s assets. The SEC had filed an emergency action charging Cohen and Nikas on Oct. 18. Nikas, Taylor and Windsor remain at large, the U.S. Attorney’s office said. None of the defendants could be reached immediately for comment. Reporting by Chris Prentice; Editing by Tom Brown",4.5
2272576,Indiana hangs on for win at Maryland,"Quarterback Peyton Ramsey came off the bench to pass for 193 yards and help rally Indiana to a 34-28 victory at Maryland on Saturday in College Park, Md. Ramsey, a junior, entered in the second quarter and hit 20 of 27 passes, including a 26-yard score late in the first half. The Hoosiers (5-2, 2-2) racked up 520 yards of total offense and won their second Big Ten East Division game in a row. Maryland (3-4, 1-3) fell for the second straight week and the third time in the last four games under first-year coach Mike Locksley. The Terrapins took a 21-17 lead 4:09 before the half when Tyrrell Pigrome hit Dontay Demus for a 15-yard score. But Ramsey, in for the injured Michael Penix Jr., took the Hoosiers 63 yards in eight plays, finding Nick Westbrook in the corner of the end zone with a perfect pass from 26 yards to put IU back in front 24-21 with just 24 seconds left. Stevie Scott led IU with 18 carries for 108 yards and two scores. His 9-yard run at 2:32 of the third quarter put the Hoosiers ahead 31-21. Maryland came right back with Javon Leake’s 1-yard run with one second left in the third to make it a three-point game. The Terrapins had two fourth-quarter possessions trailing by three points but couldn’t move the ball against the IU defense. Logan Jutus’ 34-yard field goal with 2:49 remaining put the final points on the board. Reese Taylor’s interception inside the Indiana 10-yard line in the final minute sealed the victory. The Hoosiers breezed 69 yards to net a 28-yard scoring pass from Penix to Donavan Hale on their opening possession, but the Terrapins answered immediately on Pigrome’s 11-yard pass to Chigozkiem Okonkwo. The two offense-minded teams traded rushing scores, including a 60-yard run by Leake, who started for the injured Anthony McFarland and racked up a career-high 158 yards on 23 rushes. —Field Level Media ",3.5
2287491,US military vehicles cross into Syria," (CNN)A convoy of about 18 US military vehicles departed northern Iraq and headed into Syria on Saturday morning, rumbling through Rmeilan town, past Qamishli and toward the interior of the war-torn country. CNN video shows a group of American armored vehicles and trucks on the road near Rmeilan. Syrian Democratic Forces fighters and a KRG border official confirmed the US military crossing earlier in the day. A US official told CNN that about a dozen armored US vehicles moved south from Qamishli toward Deir Ezzor, an area near the oil fields in Syria that President Donald Trump said he is trying to protect.  The Pentagon declined to give an official comment on troop movements, citing security reasons.  The move comes a day after US Defense Secretary Mark Esper, speaking at NATO headquarters in Brussels, said United States forces in Syria are ""now taking some actions"" to strengthen their position in the Deir Ezzor region in eastern Syria to prevent ISIS from taking control of oil facilities there and that will include some ""mechanized forces.""  The US was taking the action to ""ensure that we can deny ISIS access to the oil fields,"" Esper said. ""Because we want to make sure they do not have access to the resources that may allow them to strike within the region, to strike Europe, to strike the United States."" Trump had tweeted earlier Thursday the US would continue securing oil fields in Syria. CORRECTION: The headline has been updated to reflect that military vehicles headed into Syria near Rmeilan on Saturday. This story has been updated to include additional developments.

2288108,State Department agrees to produce some Ukraine records by November 22,"Washington (CNN)The State Department has agreed to produce some Ukraine-related documents by November 22, according to a joint court filing Wednesday night from the department and watchdog group American Oversight. There is not a full description yet of how many documents may emerge through this Freedom of Information Act production, but the agreement marks a promise by the State Department to search for documents, redact them, and give them to American Oversight by November 22. That promise is significant as the State Department has not turned over requested documents to Capitol Hill. Witnesses have given documents to the State Department, which hasn't given them to impeachment investigators. American Oversight is now specifically seeking only communications from or to top State Department officials -- including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo -- when they're communicating with people outside the government, including or about former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.  The State Department will also look into the records of Pompeo and two other officials for ""final directives"" to recall then-Ambassador Yovanovitch from her post. Earlier this month, in response to an emergency motion from American Oversight, Judge Christopher Cooper ordered lawyers for the group and the State Department to come together to narrow the scope of the documents in the request -- eliminating those that would likely be exempt from release -- and produce documents in the next 30 days. Cooper said that he could not think of a third party exemption that would prevent the release of correspondence between Giuliani and top State Department officials regarding Ukraine. ""The judge zeroed in on communications with Rudy Giuliani to be most subject to public disclosure. Why? Because he doesn't work for the government,"" American Oversight Executive Director Austin Evers told reporters at the time. American Oversight had filed a lawsuit and asked for a preliminary injunction to compel the State Department to begin rapidly processing and releasing senior officials' correspondence with Giuliani and other communications about efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government to open a political investigation. The lawsuit also sought the release of records related to the recall of Yovanovitch. CNN's Paul LeBlanc contributed to this story.",3.0
2288784,Libra Association announces new board members after recent departures,"In Geneva on Monday, the remaining members of the Libra Association held their inaugural meeting, bringing together executives from more than 20 different companies across the world. Much of the meeting was devoted to establishing the basic governance of the new association, which before Monday had been more of a proposal than a functional institution. The group named five board members — including Xapo CEO Wences Casares, Andreessen Horowitz partner and blockchain lead Katie Haun, and Facebook executive David Marcus, who has been the primary face of the project up until now. The members also laid out a number of bylaws describing the process for electing new board members, voting on proposals, and adjudicating disputes. “Given the project’s scale and ambition, there are still a number of challenges to overcome,” Haun said in a statement, “including regulatory compliance.” That compliance has been a particularly sore point for payment processors, many of whom left the association just days before the inaugural meeting. Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Stripe, and Mercado Pago were all initially signed on as founding members of the Libra Association, but none were present in Geneva, having dropped out in advance of the meeting. Notably, the bylaws also spell out that any member of the association may leave for any reason, although transferring membership is only allowed under more limited circumstances. Only one payment processor remains involved with the Libra Association: PayU, a Dutch company focused on mobile and web payments in the European market. PayU had declined to comment in the wake of the earlier departures, but affirmed their commitment to the project at Monday’s meeting. “The mission of the association,” PayU said in a statement, “aligns seamlessly with PayU’s vision of creating a world without financial borders, where everyone can prosper.”",4.5

2295307,Ford plans to close engine plant in Michigan as part of UAW deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co plans to close an engine plant in Romeo, Michigan, as part of a tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers union for a new four-year contract, a source told Reuters on Thursday. The 600 hourly workers at the plant will be offered jobs at a nearby transmission plant or buyouts, a source said. The UAW said Wednesday the Ford deal “secured over $6 billion in major product investments in American facilities, creating and retaining over 8,500 jobs for our communities.” Ford will close the plant in the future under the UAW agreement. Ford and the UAW declined to comment. In March 2017, Ford said it was investing $150 million in the Romeo Engine Plant to boost capacity for engines and new tooling for components, one of three Michigan plants at the time it said were getting new investments. Ford said the investment was to boost the plant building engines for vehicles that include Ford Super Duty, E-Series, Ford Shelby GT 350 Mustang and Shelby GT350R Mustang, along with components for F-Series, Mustang, Explorer and Edge. In 2017 U.S. President Donald Trump praised Ford’s decision to invest in Romeo and two other Michigan plants. “Major investment to be made in three Michigan plants,” Trump posted on Twitter at the time. “Car companies coming back to U.S. JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!” In contrast to Ford, General Motors Co endured a 40-day-strike by its U.S. hourly workforce that cost it about $3 billion before winning approval for a new labor deal earlier this month. Detailed terms of the Ford deal were not released, but they are expected to echo those agreed to with GM, as the union typically uses the first deal as a pattern for those that follow. The deal includes a signing bonus of $9,000 per person, according to a person familiar with the deal who asked not to be identified. Union members at GM received $11,000 per person. UAW leaders from the various U.S. plants will meet on Friday to potentially approve the deal, which then would be sent to the 55,000 members at Ford for final approval, a union spokesman said.

2295487,Polish Supreme Court rejects vote recount bid by ruling nationalists,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland’s Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected one of six requests for a vote recount by the ruling nationalists (PiS) following the Oct. 13 election in which they narrowly lost their majority in the upper house Senate. The Law and Justice party’s setback in the Senate, coupled with a smaller than hoped for majority in the lower house, dealt a blow to its bid for a stronger mandate to pursue disputed overhauls of the judiciary, media and cultural institutions. Supreme Court justices rebuffed the government’s bid for a recount in one Senate district, saying the difference between the candidates’ respective results was too small, and reserved a ruling on five other challenges. PiS had said that it was demanding recounts because in some of the districts where it lost by a narrow margin there were a lot of ballots that were spoiled, not counted or left blank. “The purpose of an electoral protest,” the court said in a statement, “is to point out specific violations of law affecting the outcome of the election...not to recalculate votes because of the slight difference between individual candidates.” Opposition parties hold 48 of 100 seats in the upper house, but wield a majority thanks to three independent senators who are broadly supportive. The Senate has the power to delay legislation and appoint some prominent figures in the state. Poland’s ruling eurosceptic nationalists have been embroiled in a long-running dispute with the European Union over its reforms of the judiciary and public media, which critics say have eroded the independence of both.

2300304,"CDC reports 1,888 illnesses, including 37 deaths, caused by vaping | TheHill","The number of people who have become sick after vaping is nearing 2,000, according to new data released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As of Tuesday, the CDC had confirmed 1,888 probable lung injury cases associated with vaping since the outbreak started earlier this year.  That's an increase of 284 cases from last week. The CDC also confirmed 37 deaths in 24 states and D.C., an increase of three fatalities from last week.  The CDC still hasn't identified a specific product or ingredient that is making people sick.  Most of the patients had vaped THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, before becoming ill; many had purchased those products off the street. But it's not clear if it's the THC or any number of chemicals and substances that are found in vaping liquids are causing the lung illnesses. Vitamin E acetate, an ingredient often found in dietary supplements that is harmful if inhaled into the lungs, has been identified in some, but not all, of the product samples collected from patients.  CDC principle deputy director Anne Schuchat said last month it is likely there are multiple causes of the illnesses.  “I think there will be multiple causes and potentially more than one root cause,” she said.

2302770,"South Sudan president, ex-rebel leader agree to delay unity government: Uganda","JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan’s president and a former rebel leader agreed on Thursday to delay forming a unity government for 100 days beyond the Nov. 12 deadline, Uganda’s presidency said, buying time after concerns that war could resume if the two sides were pushed. South Sudanese President Salva Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar met in Uganda in a last-ditch effort to resolve outstanding disputes that were preventing the formation of a coalition government in time for the deadline. Kiir and Machar signed a peace deal in September 2018, under pressure from the United Nations, United States and regional governments to end a five-year civil war that devastated the world’s youngest country. Both sides blame each other for not meeting milestones stipulated by the peace deal, especially the integration of different fighting forces. Thursday’s meeting “was held in a cordial and friendly atmosphere”, the Ugandan statement said. Both sides agreed that there were “critical tasks” related to the deal that were not yet complete, particularly related to “security arrangements and governance”, it added. A spokesman for Machar praised the new agreement. “This is good and will enable the security arrangements to be completed if resources are availed as required”, spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel told Reuters by phone after the meeting ended. There was no immediate comment from Kiir. “This avoids the worst, even if it falls short of providing a clear path to resolving the outstanding issues,” said Alan Boswell, a senior analyst with Brussels-based think-tank International Crisis Group. “The regional mediators must step up at the highest levels to move the peace process forward,” he said. Oil-producing South Sudan, which became an independent country in 2011, plunged into civil war in 2013 after Kiir sacked Machar as vice president. The conflict killed an estimated 400,000 people, triggered a famine and created Africa’s biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. Kiir and Machar had traded accusations ahead of the meeting hosted by Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, as concerns grew that the ceasefire would not hold after Tuesday’s deadline. “Nothing has been done” by the government to implement the peace deal, Machar’s spokesman Puok Both Baluang told Reuters by phone on Wednesday. But Kiir told parliament on Tuesday the government had paid more than $30 million to cover the costs of implementing the deal. It was not clear how the money was spent. His spokesman, Ateny Wek Ateny, declined to say why the government had not released the total $100 million it had pledged to spend. The different security forces were supposed to be registered, disarmed, retrained and integrated. But even registration is incomplete, the chairman of the international body monitoring the peace deal told Reuters on Wednesday. Many commanders say they have not received enough forms to register the forces, the chairman of the Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring Mechanism said in a phone interview. There are also shortages of food and medicine, Major General Desta Abiche Ageno said. “We are now observing many of those registered forces leaving designated sites.” Both Kiir and Machar have been demanding shared control of the capital, a problem that has triggered war twice already, Crisis Group noted earlier this week. Thursday’s statement did not include any details on security plans for Juba. It said that the two sides, along with governments in the region that are monitoring the deal, had agreed to meet to review progress in 50 days.

2302939,NBA fines Clippers $50K over Kawhi-related comments,"The NBA fined the Los Angeles Clippers $50,000 on Thursday for comments made about Kawhi Leonard and his injury status. On Wednesday, the league said it accepted the Clippers plan to sit Leonard, who was listed on the injury report with an ailing knee, in the first of back-to-back games. He did not play in a 129-124 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks - a game that was nationally televised by ESPN. But a remark later made by coach Doc Rivers caught the attention of the NBA. “I think Kawhi made a statement that he’s never felt better. It’s our job to make sure he stays that way. That’s important. But he played a lot of minutes in the playoffs last year,” Rivers said. “So, it’s not, uh, a health thing really. It is in some ways. We want him to just keep feeling better and getting better.” In a statement announcing the fine on Thursday, the league said it continued to believe that Leonard has an injury but questioned Rivers’ remarks. “Following additional review of the LA Clippers not playing Kawhi Leonard in last night’s game against the Milwaukee Bucks, the NBA has confirmed that the team’s decision to sit Leonard for management of an injury was consistent with league rules,” the statement read. “The team has reasonably determined that Leonard is suffering from an ongoing injury to the patella tendon in his left knee and has been placed by the team at this time on an injury protocol for back-to-back games. “The NBA has fined the Clippers $50,000 for statements, including by head coach Doc Rivers, that were inconsistent with Leonard’s health status.” The Clippers host the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday night on TNT, and Leonard is expected to play. The forward, who signed as a free agent with the Clippers in the offseason, has yet to play both games of a back-to-back this season and last played in a set in April 2017, when he was a member of the San Antonio Spurs. Leonard played in just nine games for the Spurs in 2017-18 due to a quadriceps injury and played in just 60 of 82 regular-season games for the Toronto Raptors last season. —Field Level Media",3.5
2303604,Wall Street Weekahead: Small-cap shares poised to benefit from shift to value,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Beleaguered shares of small U.S. companies are set for a bump in performance as value stocks have risen, market analysts say, but small caps could quickly fade again with an economic setback. The small-cap Russell 2000 index has lagged the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX for much of 2019 and has yet to escape the bear market it confirmed last December. Still, so far this quarter, the Russell 2000 has risen 4.6%, edging out the 3.6% rise in the S&P 500. The Russell’s outperformance is in tandem with the S&P 500 Value index .IVX, whose 5.2% quarter-to-date climb has outpaced the S&P 500 Growth index’s .IGX 2.3% advance over the same period. Improving economic sentiment has prompted some investors to take a second look at undeperformers among both value stocks and small-cap shares. Value shares tend to be concentrated in economically sensitive sectors such as financials and energy. Shares of small-cap companies, which tend to be more domestically focused than their large-cap counterparts, often track investors’ outlook on the U.S. economy. Reflecting growing economic optimism, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR has moved well off its early September lows, and the yield curve between 3-month bills US3MT=RR and 10-year notes has steepened. As a result, some investors believe U.S. small-cap stocks are set to rally. The performance of financial shares, in particular, has improved as yields have risen, which could help boost small-cap shares. Financials make up 20% of the Russell 2000, as compared to 13% of the S&P 500. “Higher rates tell us that you’ve got a stronger economy,” said Gary Bradshaw, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. “Small caps, which have lagged the large caps, can certainly catch up (given) this rotation into value.” In recent months, Bradshaw said, Hodges has added positions in small-cap value companies such as oil and natural gas companies Matador Resources Co (MTDR.N) and Parsley Energy Inc (PE.N) as well as Brinker International Inc (EAT.N), which owns Chili’s restaurants. Though some market analysts are skeptical that large-cap value shares will sustain their market leadership, the improving earnings backdrop for small-cap companies could nonetheless boost their shares. Earlier this year, the earnings growth rate for small-cap companies lagged that of large-cap companies, in an aberration from usual patterns, said Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York. But since then, small-cap earnings growth has recovered. “People like small caps because they offer superior earnings growth longer-term,” she said. “You couldn’t really say that based on these stats at the beginning of the year, but now we look at these stats and the normal relationship is returning.” Still, the outlook for small-cap shares is highly dependent on U.S. economic data, which suggest a slowdown. The Institute of Supply Management’s widely followed manufacturing index, for instance, has indicated a contraction in U.S. factory activity for three straight months. A U.S.-China trade agreement would help bolster economic indicators in the manufacturing and industrial sectors, but it remains tentative. Data on October U.S. industrial production and retail sales, along with the National Federation of Independent Business’s monthly small business survey, are scheduled for release next week. “If we don’t get a deal on trade, if we get more indications that the U.S. economy is weaker, small caps are going to get crushed,” said Steven DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York. “But I see (economic) growth holding up.” Reporting by April Joyner; Editing by Alden Bentley and Cynthia Osterman",3.0
2306012,Cuba attracts $1.7 billion in foreign investment despite U.S. sanctions,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba said on Wednesday the country had attracted $1.7 billion worth of foreign investment over the past year despite a tighter U.S. trade embargo and worsening cash crunch, although it did not reach its goal of $2 billion to $2.5 billion annually. Trade Minister Rodrigo Malmierca told a news conference at Cuba’s annual trade fair in Havana that 25 investment projects had been agreed since October last year, compared with 40 in the same period the previous year worth a lesser $1.5 billion. Cuba’s Communist government passed a new foreign investment law five years ago and created a special economic zone just west of Havana boasting tax and customs breaks with the hope of attracting more foreign capital to boost its ailing state-dominated economy. For a few years, Cuba had improved relations with the West, and foreign companies including U.S. firms descended upon Havana en masse, elbowing one another to gain a foothold in the opening market. Ana Teresa Igarza, director general of the special economic zone, said on Wednesday that 50 projects had been agreed so far there, with 26 already in operation. But Cuba’s economy has lost some appeal in recent years as it has entered a crisis due to the implosion of key ally Venezuela and a resulting decline in subsidies. Over the past year, there have been shortages of everything from fuel to medicine and certain foodstuffs. In addition, U.S. President Donald Trump over the past two years has rolled back the détente of his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama and imposed new sanctions on Cuba. These include allowing U.S. citizens to sue foreign companies they deem to be trafficking in properties unlawfully confiscated from them after the island’s 1959 revolution. The area of the fair presenting U.S. businesses, which had boomed only a few years ago, was a sad affair this week, with only a handful of companies present. One of the few exhibitors present was Jay Brickman, vice president of Florida-based shipping company Crowley Maritime Corp, which has been shipping foods to Cuba for nearly two decades under an exemption to the U.S. trade embargo. U.S. exports to Cuba suddenly contracted over the last month, likely due to Cuba’s difficulty getting financing in the wake of tighter sanctions. Next week, Brickman said, his firm would be sending a ship over with just 13 containers on board, compared with the 50 containers needed to break even. “It’s worse than ever before,” he said.

2330947,Ferrari adds Roma to growing 'Prancing Horse' stable,"MILAN, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Ferrari is set to roll out the Roma, a record fifth new model this year for the ‘Prancing Horse’, as it expands its stable to help sustain its profit and share price growth. The new grand tourer (GT) will make its debut on Thursday in Italy’s capital in an event inspired by Federico Fellini’s “La Dolce Vita”. GTs are more comfortable on long journeys than high-performance sports cars and models from the 1960s, some seating four, are among the most popular at auctions and among Ferrari enthusiasts. Ferrari has said previously that about 40% of its total sales could come from GT models by 2022, up from 32% now. The Roma will be a 2+ coupé, meaning it has two small rear-seats, Ferrari said on Wednesday, without disclosing its price. “With its distinctive flair and style, the car is a contemporary representation of the carefree, pleasurable way of life that characterised Rome in the 1950s and 1960s,” the Italian luxury carmaker added. It will feature a 620-horsepower, 3.85 litre eight cylinder mid-front mounted engine. This year’s other new releases include another GT, the 812 GTS, presented in September, which the company described as a return for a model type that has played a “pivotal role in the marque’s history”, as well as the F90 Stradale, Ferrari’s first hybrid car in series-production. Chief Executive Louis Camilleri said last week the hybrid SF90 Stradale was attracting “huge interest” despite initial scepticism by clients used to roaring combustion engines. Ferrari has also promised several special edition hybrid cars and a utility vehicle, the Purosangue, which is expected by late 2022 as it seeks to almost double core earnings and boost margins to above 38%, without sacrificing exclusivity. It is set to slow the roll-out of new vehicles in the coming years, as it planned to launch 15 models between 2019 and 2022, while achieving a significant increase in average retail price. Chairman John Elkann has said that Ferrari, which shipped fewer than 10,000 cars last year, would not try to chase German rival Porsche which makes more than 250,000 sports cars and SUVs annually. To capitalise further on its name, Ferrari plans new apparel and accessory collections, entertainment offers, and luxury products and services for clients.

To help narrow down your choices, I enlisted the help of my family to try five popular hot dog brands and see which one we liked best. The brands we tried were: Hebrew National — $4.60Nathan's — $5.99Sabrett — $5.99Boar's Head — $7.99Oscar Mayer — $4.49In order to really taste the hot dogs themselves, we decided to forgo the regular fixings like mustard, sauerkraut, and relish. We judged each of the dogs on their size, taste, and texture to determine which one is the best option to serve this summer.Keep reading to find out what we thought about each of the brands. 







 



First, we tasted the Boar's Head hot dogs, and it was a pleasant surprise.










My dad and step-mom said they knew which hot dogs would be the best before even starting the taste test: Boar's Head. They said it's the only brand they buy during the summer, despite it being the most expensive option.However, I was immediately skeptical. Being the largest of the five, almost a third of the hot dog did not fit into the bun, which is a big no-no for me. There was also a strange tail at the end of the hot dog. It looked a bit off-putting, but I took a bite anyway.The hot dog's ""natural skin"" was a surprise upon the first bite because it was a bit more difficult to bite into, giving the dog a certain chewiness, in my opinion. From the strange tail to the thicker skin, I found that a Boar's Head hot dog is eerily similar to a sausage. Although I usually don't like tougher skins on hot dogs, the flavor was still delightful. 





Next, we tasted the Hebrew National hot dogs and had some converts.










Hebrew National's hot dogs are advertised as 100% kosher beef and are considered a classic, often served at summer barbecues. When I bit into it, I instantly understood why. A flavorful taste burst into my mouth, offering the quintessential summer hot dog flavor. Not only was it tasty, but it was also surprisingly juicy. My sister was also pleasantly surprised by the taste of the Hebrew National, and my dad and step-mom even admitted that it had more flavor than their usual favorite, Boar's Head. 



 



Next, we moved on to Nathan's brand of hot dogs — and the reactions were split.










Growing up in New York, my dad used to take me to Coney Island to eat the famous Nathan's hot dogs on the boardwalk. It goes without saying that my family has a special connection to the Nathan's brand, and that's probably why my dad loved this hot dog during the taste test. However, my sister and I had very different reactions. In contrast to the Hebrew National dog, this one was much drier, in my opinion. I also found that it had a strange after-taste that startled me. To me, the hot dog tasted saltier and smokier than the Hebrew National one. 





After Nathan's, we tried the Sabrett brand, and we were mostly underwhelmed.










Sabbrett was one of the lengthier hot dogs that did not fit entirely in the bun, which is one of my biggest pet peeves. I thought that the first bite lacked flavor, and that the following bites continued to be just as bland. It was also a bit dry for my liking. The rest of my family was equally underwhelmed.



 



Lastly, we ate the Oscar Mayer hot dog.










The Oscar Mayer hot dog stood out from the rest because it was noticeably smaller than the other dogs and looked a bit lonesome in the bun. It was also much thicker and chunkier than the rest, which was unappealing to me. My concerns were confirmed when everyone bit into the meat and groaned. I found the taste off-putting and reminiscent of lunch meat, specifically sour bologna. 





The verdict.










The market is filled with options for your summer barbecue. However, the Hebrew National hot dog brand came out on top for us. It has a great flavor and texture, and it can even impress some of the most stubborn skeptics. Read more:We tried 4 brands of store-bought brownies and the winner was surprisingI'm 24 years old and I just ate at The Cheesecake Factory for the first time — here's why I've been missing outWe tried chili from Potbelly and Wendy's — and the winner was surprisingWe tried 3 popular brands of frozen waffles — here's the one you'll want to eat on a lazy Sunday morning

Some even mention the IRS.A tax lawyer says any legitimate IRS letter or notice will have an official seal and a notice or letter number, among other distinguishing markers.If you determine your letter or notice from the IRS is real, don't ignore it.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.The IRS prefers to get in touch with taxpayers via snail mail, and scammers know it. The Internal Revenue Service is in the thick of correspondence season, reported tax lawyer Kelly Phillips Erb for Forbes. It's the period when the agency sends out letters, typically via the US Postal Service, requesting late payments and notifying taxpayers of errors on their returns.But just because you receive a formal-looking piece of mail about your taxes doesn't mean you should take it as fact. Earlier this summer, the IRS warned taxpayers about a popular scam in which fraudsters mail letters to taxpayers from a non-existent group called the requesting immediate payments. Some letters even mention the IRS and may include factual tax information. ""That's scary for taxpayers because it feels legitimate, but keep in mind that some tax-related information, like liens that have been filed against taxpayers, may be available to the public,"" Phillips Erb wrote. ""Don't be frightened into giving up cash or personal information just because a scammer knows one or two facts about you.""According to Phillips Erb, a real letter from the IRS will have a few distinguishing markers, such as an official IRS seal, a notice or letter number in the top right corner of the paper, information about your rights as a taxpayer, and a phone number to contact the IRS directly. Perhaps most telling, if the letter is asking for a gift card, cash, or check to be sent to any person or organization other than the US Treasury, it's fraudulent.You can always confirm the validity of an IRS notice or letter by creating or logging into an existing account on the IRS website, or calling the agency directly. If you determine the letter or notice is legitimate and is requesting you either confirm a change, provide information, or make a payment, don't ignore it.You should always reportTreasury Inspector General800-366-4484 or phishing@irs.gov.

Email me at .First off, this is the last week to submit nominations for Business Insider's inaugural list of CMOs to watch. Please submit your ideas by Friday here.On to the news. My colleague Tanya Dua looked at what the news about independent ad agency Barton F. Graf shutting down means for the advertising industry.The sudden demise of a lauded New York agency is a chilling reminder of the ad industry's massive ongoing challengesAmong the big changes happening to agencies' business models is a drop in independent agencies. According to data from Forrester Research and SoDa, the percentage of independent agencies dropped from 51% to 39% between 2016 and 2018.Here are the other big takeaways from Tanya's reporting:More big brands like Verizon and Marriott are taking their advertising in-house.Facebook and Google dominate digital ad spending and are cutting into traditional creative work that Barton F. Graf specialized in.Advertisers are increasingly looking for more project-based work over agency-of-record relationships with agencies to cut costs.But as more pressure is put on the holding company model, some independent agencies may have a new opportunity to win back clients.""Smaller agencies usually have lighter operational models, less legacy overhead, and more nimble ways of delivering content at speed, which is what larger agencies can often lack,"" said Claire Telling, co-CEO of Grace Blue. ""They just have to set up a financial structure that allows for the company to stay afloat during potential dry spells.""Over on Business Insider's tech desk, news editor Rob Price broke the big story about Instagram kicking marketing firm HYp3R off of its platform after it was discovered that the startup had been scraping location data.Instagram's lax privacy practices let a trusted partner track millions of users' physical locations, secretly save their stories, and flout its rulesAfter Business Insider contacted Instagram about HYp3R's practices, Instagram sent the firm a cease-and-desist letter, and HYp3R shut down its platform. The startup claims that its practices do not break Instagram's rules.Facebook also emailed some of its other Marketing Partners to explain how it handles data on its platform.Meanwhile, I looked into what Foursquare's acquisition of Placed means for marketers. Foursquare acquired the location-based measurement firm from Snap as part of a $150 million round of funding in May.We got the pitch deck Foursquare is using to sell advertisers location data — even as regulation and privacy concerns mountPlaced founder and new Foursquare president David Shim sat down with me to go over Foursquare's pitch deck that the company is presenting to advertisers.Location-based firms have struggled to stay afloat with privacy regulations like Europe's General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, but Foursquare says that it's an outlier in the industry because its data is collected from consumers who have opted in to sharing their location.Shim said the goal of the combined Foursquare and Placed company is to give marketers a one-stop shop for location data to do everything from planning, buying, and measuring campaigns.Here are other great stories from media, marketing, and advertising.

2342617,Outerknown review: We tried Kelly Slater's sustainable clothing brand,"Outerknown, a clothing brand cofounded by pro surfer Kelly Slater, makes effortless and casual beach styles rooted in sustainability and transparency. We tried nine men's and women's styles from the brand and confirmed their style, comfort, and durability. Below, you'll find pictures of how we styled our picks.Outerknown should be top of mind for anyone who cares about the environment and is looking for surf lifestyle-inspired essentials. While professional surfer Kelly Slater has spent the last 29 years of his life smashing the competition and winning a record 11 World Titles, another venture tied to his love for surf has also been occupying his time.In 2014, he left his sponsorship from surfwear giant Quiksilver to start his own surf brand, Outerknown.







Slater, a longtime advocate for sustainable living, wanted to create a lifestyle brand for everyone that was rooted in good design and sustainable production. He partnered with designer John Moore to make this idea a reality. Moore says, ""We're surfers who grew up with surf brands, but we grew out of logos. And we want to wear clothing that's made better and looks better."" Made better: That means using sustainable materials (over 90% of Outerknown's products are made from organic, recycled, or regenerated materials) as well as using transparent and responsible manufacturing partners, who follow strict guidelines of safety and working conditions by the Fair Labor Associationonscious development takes time and investment. There are added costs in creating quality product made to last, in finding and partnering with the right factories that value worker well-being, and in sourcing and leveraging materials that cause less harm."" ""At the end of the day, we're looking at the long run and what's best 'For People and Planet.' We're putting in the work to build a truly sustainable model rather than zeroing in on short-term trends or financials,"" he says.

Meander Beach Pants










 
Meander Beach Pants, available in 2 colors, $118Of course, I had to take this pair of 'Beach Pants' to the beach. I wore them as a swimsuit cover-up when I went to Coney Island this summer, and they turned out to be the right choice — lightweight, breathable, and relaxed. My legs had plenty of room to move around in the wide pant legs and they had a comfortable high-rise fit. The back of the waistband has elastic, which is smart considering I filled my body with Nathan's hot dogs while on the boardwalk. The white pair is slightly transparent, so I'm not sure you could wear it outside of a beach, beach town, or lounging setting, but it is a perfect choice in casual environments. —Connie Chen, reporter

Oasis Dress










 
Oasis Dress, available in 3 colors, $148I generally don't wear color, but something about this green midi dress really caught my eye. I love that the straps are adjustable — I'm 5-foot-1, but I have a large chest that often requires me to to size up, which means straps are usually too long for me. The ties on this dress allow me to get a custom fit, and the length is perfect on my frame. —Sally Kaplan, editor 



 



Station Jumpsuit










 
Station Jumpsuit, available in 3 colors, $178The Station Jumpsuit is utilitarian, cool, and very fun to style thanks to its front zipper, sleeves that you can roll up or leave down, and tapered silhouette. It's tough and functional, but you can also make it look more casual or dressed up, making its $180 price tag feel more justified.It's made from 51% organic cotton and 49% linen, resulting in an instantly comfortable feel from the very first wear. Right now, NYC weather is a little too hot and muggy for me to wear the suit without overheating, but I can't wait to live in it during fall and winter. —Connie Chen, reporter 





Solstice Cozy Hoodie










 
Solstice Cozy Hoodie, available in 3 colors, $138Hopefully you can't tell, but I had a 102-degree fever when I took this picture. I was on my way to the doctor's office when I remembered I needed a shot of my Outerknown sweatshirt for this article, so I took one quickly on my way out the door.The takeaway here, though, has little to do with what I look like and everything to do with the fact that this was the sweatshirt I chose to wear on a day I felt my absolute worst. It's the perfect medium weight, lined with a terrycloth-like inner that felt simultaneously cozy but not thick. I feel better now, but I've worn this sweatshirt nearly every day since. —Sally Kaplan, editor

The Folk Top










 
The Folk Top, available in 6 colors, $98This top is so flowy and perfect for summer. It's made from organic cotton spun to be exceptionally thin and lightweight, so you can feel the breeze even when you're fully covered up. I love tucking it into jeans for a casual look I can pull off at work or on the weekends.It comes in six colors, but I will say the lighter ones are slightly sheer, so choose your undergarments accordingly.  —Sally Kaplan, editor

Oasis Top










 
Oasis Top, available in 4 colors, $78This cropped top is sweet, breezy, and easy to wear. You can tuck it into a skirt or pair of pants, or let it flow loosely over your body. It features touches that are both stylish and practical, like the shoulder ties, which let you get a customized fit, and the elastic at the top, which prevents the chest area from gaping. —Connie Chen, reporter

2355416,"What is long-term care insurance? Definition, cost, and how it works","Long-term care comes at a huge cost to many retirees living in the US.Long-term care insurance covers costs related to in-home aid, assisted living facilities, and nursing home care, which aren't covered by Medicare.If you think you'll need help paying for long-term care, it's recommended to buy a policy between ages 52 and 64 to secure the best rates.Long-term care insurance usually kicks in anywhere from 30 to 90 days after eligibility is confirmed and will pay a daily benefit amount up to a maximum number of days or amount of money.Read more personal finance coverage.Healthcare is the largest expense most retirees face.Medicare doesn't cover everything, including most long-term care needs, so many Americans are forced to drain their own savings, lean on family and friends, or use private insurance to afford daily assistance if they need it.As of 2016, a semi-private room in a nursing home costs, on average, $6,845 a month, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services, while a completely private room will set you back about $7,700 a month. A one-bedroom unit in an assisted living facility costs around $3,630 a month and an in-home health aide charges about $20.50 an hour, on average.Even if these costs seem manageable at face value, they can add up tremendously. Researchers from the Urban Institute estimate that more than half of Americans over age 65 will develop a disability that requires long-term care for two years or less at an average total cost of $138,000. About one in seven adults, they found, would need care for more than five years.Long-term care insurance can help minimize these costs.What is long-term care insurance?Long-term care (assistance beyond 100 days) is generally not covered by Medicare because it's considered custodial care and not medical care. While Medicaid does cover long-term care for millions of Americans, there's an exceptionally low income threshold to qualify.Long-term care (LTC) insurance can help retirees who don't want to spend down their assets to qualify for Medicaid afford the cost of an in-home caretaker, or a stay at an assisted-living facility, skilled nursing facility, or nursing home.How does long-term care insurance work?Like all other forms of insurance, once you buy an LTC policy and begin paying the monthly premium, you become entitled to the benefits.Coverage on most LTC insurance policies kicks in once the policyholder needs help with two or more of the six Activities of Daily Living (ADLs): eating, bathing, dressing, transferring, using the toilet, and maintaining continence. Severe cognitive impairment that increases the policyholder's health and safety risk also qualifies.Each policy has an elimination period, which states the number of days the insured must wait to receive benefits after the insurer determines they're eligible. A typical elimination period is 30, 60, or 90 days.The amount of money the policyholder will be reimbursed for is known as the daily limit. This is outlined in the policy and usually around $150 a day or more. The insurer will continue paying the daily benefit up to a maximum number of days, typically a period between two years and 10 years, or up to a specified amount of money.Who needs long-term care insurance?It's difficult to know whether or not a person will need long-term care in their later years, just as it's impossible to predict whether a person will ever need to draw on the benefits of homeowners insurance or life insurance. But if you're concerned about the costs of elder care and know your own savings or help from family won't cover it, it's a good idea to get long-term care insurance.According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, those most likely to need long-term care are women, because they statistically outlive men and in many cases wind up at home alone; people with chronic illnesses that lead to disability; people with a poor family health history; people with poor diet and exercise habits; and people with a chronic condition like diabetes or high blood pressure.How much does long-term care insurance cost?The longer you wait to buy long-term care insurance, the more expensive it is. Insurers determine premiums based on age, health, the type of policy, benefit period, and coverage amount. The American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance recommends buying a policy between ages 52 and 64 for the best rates.A single male in good health will pay about $2,050 year, on average, while a single female will pay $2,700 annually, according to the organization's data. For a couple aged 55, the average annual premium is around $3,050. It's important to note that insurers reserve the right to increase your premium after you buy the policy, as long as they do it for all policyholders in the same classification.People who already need help with any qualifying daily activities, have had a stroke in the last several years, or have dementia, a progressive neurological condition, AIDS, or metastatic cancer may be denied long-term care insurance.Where do I buy long-term care insurance?Most LTC insurance policies are sold by about 15 to 20 insurers nationally, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services. It pays to shop around and compare quotes online, but be sure to always check an insurance company's ratings before buying a policy to get an idea of its claims payout history and track record.LTC insurance can get complicated, so you may considering getting help from an insurance broker or certified financial planner to make sure you're choosing the right policy for your needs.Your employer may also offer long-term care insurance at a group rate, which is often cheaper than the cost of an individual policy.Related coverage from How to Do Everything: Money:How to get health insuranceEverything you need to know about financial plannersHow does life insurance work?How to retire with health insurance if you're too young for Medicare",4.5

2358256,WeWork sends noncompete letters to laid-off workers,"WeWork has sent combative legal letters to people it laid off in a round of job cuts earlier in 2019, warning them not to compete with its business.The letters warn the former employees to stick to the terms of their contracts, or the company will pursue legal action.

Sectors of the market, including utilities and telecommunications, are widely considered the default places to seek refuge in times of market turmoil. These defensive sectors provide some cushion during sell-offs. But investors who overweight them tend to lose out in the long term, according to Joshua Bennett, a portfolio manager of the Alger subsidiary Weatherbie Capital.He told Business Insider how his alternative approach proved to be superior during the financial crisis and explained how it continues to outperform today.Click here for more BI Prime stories.With the stock market trading at all-time highs, many investors are already planning ahead for how to protect their portfolios when the next downturn occurs.Defensive sectors like utilities and telecommunications are widely considered some of the most attractive places to seek refuge in less-rosy market circumstances.However, these sectors can actually lead to underperformance during and after sell-offs, according to a team of Weatherbie Capital investors, including Joshua Bennett, a portfolio manager and director of research. Weatherbie is a subsidiary of Alger, a $28 billion investment firm.Bennett and his colleagues arrived at this conclusion by dissecting the so-called downside and upside capture ratios of telecoms and software stocks. These ratios measure a stock's up or down move relative to the rest of the market.  In the three years ending on December 31, 2009 — a period that included the Great Recession — the telecoms sector proved to be defensive because it had a lower downside capture ratio compared with software stocks. This means software stocks fell more than the broader market compared with telecoms. But where it gets interesting — and instructive — is in the rally that ensued after stocks bottomed out in March 2009. Software outperformed telecoms during this comeback. Telecoms had a lower upside capture ratio, meaning that it rallied less compared with the rest of the market during the recovery.In other words, seeking refuge in telecoms — a traditionally defensive sector — was a less profitable strategy over a longer stretch of time.The chart below depicts both trends at play during and shortly after the recent financial crisis. 







So what should investors do instead of running to defensive sectors by default? Bennett's strategy is all about finding the most innovative companies. ""The reason we do that is those companies control their own destiny,"" he told Business Insider during a recent interview.He added: ""By being more innovative, they retain their pricing control, they continue to gain volume as their market share increases, and they don't ride that wave of the cyclicality of the market."" This focus on innovative businesses has helped the fund he comanages outperform most of its competitors. Returns from the $568 million Alger Weatherbie Specialized Growth Fund sit in the 91st percentile year to date and in the 93rd percentile for the past three years, according to Bloomberg data.How to find innovative companiesBennett highlighted a few qualitative and quantitative ways he unearths a company's level of innovation. He likes to interview management teams and tour company facilities — especially for businesses with physical products — to understand where the majority of revenue growth stems from and why.In his view, a product that is booming along with its industry is quite different from one that's being catalyzed by its unique features.He also considers the share of revenues derived from newer products versus older ones. The more money a company is making from its recently released products, the more innovative it likely is. Another quantitative metric he examines is the share of revenues spent on research and development. Once again, a higher number on this gauge is better.Additionally, he considers the returns on invested capital.""We're looking for companies that not only have returns well ahead of their cost of capital, but where that gap is growing over time — where we see that returns are expanding and the cost of capital is stable or even coming down,"" he said.""That's evidence of a company doing something right on the innovation side, and competitors aren't eating away at their profits,"" he added.One stock that fits this profile is Insulet, a maker of wearable insulin pods for people with diabetes. Their product monitors insulin levels and eliminates the need for people to manually inject themselves multiple times a day.The stock has gained 133% this year — and Bennett thinks there's more innovation to come.",4.0
2360904,Marc Lasry: Stock market would fall 20%-30% if Elizabeth Warren wins,"Marc Lasry, a billionaire and major Democratic donor, is the latest Wall Street investor to warn about the damage the stock market could sustain if Elizabeth Warren were to win the presidency. Lasry, co-founder of Avenue Capital who made his fortune putting money into distressed assets, told CNBC on Friday that a Warren victory in the 2020 race could send the market down as much as 30%. ""It's abundantly clear that's what's going to happen,"" he said, adding politics going into next year's election are a ""huge risk,"" because Democrats and Republicans are ""night and day"" on the issues. If President Donald Trump was reelected, ""you're going to continue having less regulation; I think the market will view that as being positive,"" Lasry said. ""I think if she's the president [Warren], market's down 20%, 30%."" If Warren were to win the Democratic nomination, ""the market is then going to have to start pricing that in, and I think you'll start seeing just the market going down,"" he said. ""It's not going to happen overnight. But I think it's a grind, whether that takes six months or a year."" The Warren campaign, which was not immediately available for comment, started running a billionaire attack ad Thursday on CNBC. Leon Cooperman, the billionaire investor in a war-of-words with Warren over her social agenda and wealth tax, responded to that ad, which called him out. He reiterated what he told CNBC last month that if the Massachusetts senator were to win the White House the market would decline 25%. Another billionaire investor, Paul Tudor Jones, recently said the same thing. Lasry, who supported Democrat Hillary Clinton over Republican Trump in 2016, said on ""Fast Money Halftime Report"" that he currently supports Sen. Kamala Harris in the Democratic presidential primary. ""I would like to have somebody who's in the middle, whether that is center-left, that's fine. But I'd like to have somebody who wants to work with people and solve problems,"" said the Avenue Capital chief, who also owns a stake in the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks. He said that Harris ""is that person."" Former Vice President Joe Biden ""could be that person"" as well, Lasry said, adding former New York Mayor and billionaire businessman Mike Bloomberg could also fit the centrist bill if he were to officially join the Democratic presidential race. In the latest Real Clear Politics national polling average, Biden remains in the lead with 26% support, with Warren running in second with 20.8%. Harris sits a distant fifth, with single-digit support numbers.",3.5
2363774,Devin Nunes Just Tried to Out the Whistleblower on Live TV,"WASHINGTON — Grasping for their best defense of President Trump from accusations that he abused his office, Republicans have been itching to drag the anonymous intelligence-community whistleblower into the political fight. And they just tried to force a witness in the impeachment inquiry to spill the official’s name — on live national television. Rep. Devin Nunes, the California Republican famous for attempting to sue the operator of a parody Twitter account pretending to be his own cow, got into a feisty back-and-forth on Tuesday over that exact question, ultimately folding before a rebuff from Democratic House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff. Nunes avoided mentioning any of the factual issues raised by Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman during the previous hour of testimony, about how Trump’s pressure campaign on Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden had undermined Ukraine’s bloody conflict with Russia. Instead, he pressed Vindman to reveal the name of the official who had exposed the White House's pressure campaign, by demanding to know who Vindman spoke to about his concerns over Trump’s July 25 now-notorious phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Nunes dubiously insisted Vindman’s only out was to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination — as if speaking to any other government official with proper security clearance about anxiety that Trump might have abused his office should be considered a crime. “You can either answer the question or you can plead the Fifth,” Nunes said. Vindman, who testified wearing an Army service uniform covered in medals, replied he’d only spoken to individuals entitled to receive such information. “These were properly cleared individuals with a need to know,” Vindman said. Vindman’s lawyer jumped in and said his client was simply following the committee's own rules, which bar witnesses from mentioning the whistleblower’s name. Schiff agreed. “These proceedings will not be used to out the whistleblower,” Schiff interjected. Trump and his allies have railed against the whistleblower, suggesting he was motivated by anti-Trump bias rather than genuine concerns about Trump’s own behavior. Senator Rand Paul has encouraged reporters to print the whistleblower’s name. As the exchange heated up, Vindman issued Nunes a tight-lipped reprimand about addressing him with his proper military title. “Mr. Vindman, you testified in your deposition that you did not know the whistleblower,” Nunes began. Vindman shot back crisply: “Ranking member, it's Lt. Col. Vindman, please.” Cover: Steve Castor, the Republican staff attorney, right, listens as ranking member Rep. Devin Nunes questions Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, and National Security Council aide Lt. Col.

2366880,Extinction Rebellion aims to turn up political heat with hunger strikes," (This November 20th story fixes typo) By K. Sophie Will LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Extinction Rebellion activists pressing for more rapid action on climate change threats on Wednesday entered a third day of a week-long hunger strikes in 27 countries. The strikes, which began Monday, have been in part spearheaded by 20-year-old Giovanni Tamacas, a University of San Diego student, who carried out a solo hunger strike last month in front of the White House.  “We are hunger striking because we have no choice,” he said in a statement, arguing governments and corporations “have criminally and catastrophically failed to tackle the climate and ecological emergency”. In the United States, activists started their strike by occupying the office of U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who protesters said has refused to participate in a filmed interview with movement members. Pelosi did issue a statement saying she was “inspired” by young climate activists and that U.S. Democrats were “working relentlessly to safeguard our environment and ensure a healthy, sustainable world for our children”. In Britain, a handful of activists protested at headquarters of the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties, similarly demanding that candidates in upcoming British elections submit to filmed interviews with Extinction Rebellion members. Activists around the world signed up to carry out hunger strikes in countries ranging from the Democratic Republic of Congo to New Zealand, Pakistan and Turkey, Extinction Rebellion organisers said. Extinction Rebellion campaigners said the strikes were being carried out in solidarity with people facing worsening hunger as a result of climate change and was aimed at highlighting “the lack of compassion” of many in power. “You would rather watch communities be destroyed by the catastrophic hurricanes and floods the climate crisis will bring” than act on the threats, charged 17-year-old activist Sophia Kianni, from Virginia, in a statement. The Extinction Rebellion movement uses peaceful civil disobedience to highlight the risks posed by climate change and accelerating species losses in the natural world. It has called for governments to set a 2025 deadline to reduce climate-changing emissions to net zero, to declare climate emergencies and to set up citizen assemblies to give people a great voice in political decision making. More than 1,800 Extinction Rebellion activists were arrested during two weeks of disruptive street protests in October in London, police said. Reporting by K.

2371133,"UPDATE 1-Japan's exports post worst fall in 3 years as shipments to U.S., China slide","China slide@ TOKYO, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Japan's exports tumbled at their quickest pace in three years in October, threatening to tip the trade-reliant economy into recession as weakening demand from United States and China darkened the outlook. Ministry of Finance data out on Wednesday showed Japan's exports fell 9.2% year-on-year in October, a bigger decline than the 7.6% drop expected by economists in a Reuters poll. The feeble results, driven by plummeting shipments of cars and aircraft engines to the United States and plastic materials to China, marked the longest run of declines in exports since a 14-month stretch from October 2015 to November 2016. In volume terms, exports slumped 4.4% in the year to October, the third consecutive month of declines. The data comes after a preliminary reading of gross domestic product last week showed Japan's economy saw the worst growth in a year in the third quarter due to soft demand. Lawmakers have called on the government to boost spending by as much as 10 trillion yen ($92.08 billion) for the current fiscal year to support the economy, which many fear is facing additional pressure from a sales tax hike that took effect in October. The government has said it plans to compile a stimulus package as soon as possible as a pre-emptive measure against heightening overseas risks. By region, exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, slipped 10.3% year-on-year in October, down for the eighth month as shipments of plastics and car parts declined. Exports to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's overall exports, tumbled 11.2% in the year to October, down for the 12th month. Japan's exports to the United States dropped 11.4% in the year to October, hurt by reduced shipments of 2,000 to 3,000 cc cars, aircraft engines and car parts. Japan's lower house of parliament approved on Tuesday a limited trade deal Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed with the United States, clearing the way for tariff cuts next year on items including U.S. farm goods and Japanese machine tools. The nation's overall imports sank 14.8% year-on-year, a smaller decline than the median estimate for a 16.0% decrease. The trade balance came to a surplus of 17.3 billion yen, versus a 301.0 billion yen surplus seen by economists. ($1 = 108.6000 yen) (Reporting by Daniel Leussink Editing by Shri Navaratnam)",5.0

2376484,China can go carbon neutral by 2050 while still growing its economy: ETC report,"Hong Kong (CNN Business)China won't have to sacrifice economic growth or prosperity to go carbon neutral in the next few decades, according to a new report. The country could triple its economic output per person by 2050 while still reducing its carbon footprint, the Energy Transitions Commission said in the report, published on Friday in partnership with the Rocky Mountain Institute.  ""Given China's central role in the global economy, its vast renewable energy resources, and its technological leadership in key industries, China is uniquely positioned to lead the global energy transition and to decarbonize its economy completely by 2050,"" said Adair Turner, chair of the commission. Turner is the former chairman of the UK Financial Services Authority and UK Climate Committee. The commission is made up of energy producers and consumers, tech experts, finance specialists and NGOs. China is one of the world's biggest polluters and a key signatory of the 2015 Paris Agreement, a pledge by 187 countries to reduce their carbon emissions. And its role has become even more important after the United States began its formal withdrawal from the agreement earlier this month. ""For the world to deliver the Paris Climate objectives, it is vital that China has a strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century,"" Turner said.  Reducing net carbon emissions to zero by 2050 could actually make the world's second biggest economy stronger. ""Far from constraining China's ability to meet its objective of being 'a fully developed rich economy' by 2050, committing to achieve zero emissions by 2050 will spur investment and innovation that could accelerate progress,"" Turner added. The report recommends that China focus on eliminating carbon from heavy industries like steel, cement and chemicals by using recycled materials. Other measures include total electrification of road and rail services, and using biofuels for long-distance international aviation and shipping.  To achieve the net-zero target, China would need to more than double its overall electricity production, the report said. It would also need to double its annual rate of investment in solar energy and increase its investment in wind energy by three or four times. China has already undertaken steps to curb its emissions, dramatically reducing the price of solar power in many parts of the country. In 2017, it announced plans to launch a nationwide carbon market to trade credits for the right to emit carbon dioxide. The commission also calls on China to set clear targets and carry out forceful public policies to achieve the zero-carbon target.  ""For the whole world and for China itself, it is... vital that China has a strategy to achieve net zero emissions,"" Turner said. ",4.0
2378650,A Sea Change for Plastic,"Architects and designers are finding new workplace and household uses for the stuff polluting our oceans. Re-granulated plastic from fishing nets, foil from bales of hay, plastic pipes, office supplies and Styrofoam are studied and tested in the container at the Snohetta Plastic Lab in Oslo.Credit...Bjornar OØvrebo This article is part of our November Design special section, which focuses on style, function and form in the workplace. Unwanted plastics clog landfills and sully city streets and nature preserves. Most alarming to many, the material is beginning to overwhelm the planet’s oceans — from the ballooning Great Pacific Garbage Patch to trash discovered in the Pacific’s deepest reaches. The amount of plastic streaming into the oceans is roughly the equivalent of a full garbage truck every minute, according to a 2016 report by the World Economic Forum, Ellen MacArthur Foundation and McKinsey & Company. Even when we undertake the herculean job of scooping plastic trash from the sea or collecting it from beaches, the challenge remains: What to do with it? This is the question that architects, designers and consumer product companies are now exploring. At Snohetta, an architecture firm based in Norway, Stian Alessandro Ekkernes Rossi began Plast two years ago. Plast is a research project aimed at finding new uses for recycled plastics and encouraging people to see the material as a resource rather than waste. Mr. Rossi, who is an architect by training, made his own machines to grind, melt and mold different types of plastic trash into strangely beautiful new materials, including some with glassy and opalescent finishes. “It’s interesting how something that’s perceived as so low-end and cheap is really functional and long-lasting, and has amazing advantages,” he said. “People were really upset and having a political debate about whether plastic was good or bad,” he added. “Plastic is good if it’s used smartly, and bad if it’s used poorly.” To put Mr. Rossi’s research into practice, Snohetta partnered with Nordic Comfort Products, a furniture company in the north of Norway that had produced a best-selling side chair called R-48, designed in the 1960s. The company re-created the chair, now named the S-1500, with a marbleized shell made entirely from recycled plastic fishing nets, ropes and pipes reclaimed from area fish farms. Now, Snohetta is in talks with other companies about bolder applications. “We’re looking closely at how we relate it to architecture and infrastructure,” Mr. Rossi said. Others are finding uses for plastic before it reaches the water. ByFusion, a company that turns plastic waste into concrete-like building blocks called ByBlocks recently built a demonstration lifeguard tower in June in Manhattan Beach, Calif., and a school pavilion in Lihue, Hawaii. In 2017, the nonprofit Lonely Whale and the computer company Dell created NextWave, an initiative for developing products made of ocean-bound plastic. The current members are HP, General Motors, Ikea, Herman Miller, Humanscale, Trek Bicycle, Interface and Bureo. “The goal is to turn off the tap of plastic going into the water,” said Dune Ives the executive director of Lonely Whale, who defined ocean-bound plastic as plastic trash within 50 kilometers, or about 31 miles, of a waterway or coastal area that is on the ground and “also likely never to be picked up because there’s no value to it.” Dell’s NextWave project has been collecting plastic bottles and jugs in Indonesia that it transforms into packaging for electronics. HP uses recycled ocean-bound plastic in its ink cartridges and has started incorporating some of the material in laptops and other computer hardware. In April, it reported gathering more than 25 million plastic bottles in Haiti. Last year, Humanscale introduced the Smart Ocean task chair, a version of its Diffrient Smart Chair that uses almost two pounds of nylon from recycled fishing nets. The material comes from Bureo, a company that collects discarded fishing nets in Chile and recycles them into plastic pellets that can then be molded into new products. Discarded fishing gear is a significant part of the problem, Ms. Ives said, estimating that it represents about 10 to 20 percent of all plastic in the oceans. A study of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch completed last year by Ocean Cleanup, a nonprofit, found that 46 percent of the mass was discarded fishing gear. “When a fishing net reaches the end of its life, they just cut it loose and let it go into the ocean, where it does a tremendous amount of damage,” said Robert King, the chief executive of Humanscale. “Marine animals get tangled in it and killed, and it can destroy ecosystems on the bottom.” To capture more of the material, Humanscale is now working with Bureo to transform nylon from fishing nets into thread that can be knitted into upholstery fabric. “Ultimately, we’d really like to turn most of our textiles into ocean textiles,” Mr. King said. Humanscale is also developing a chair made entirely from ocean-bound plastic, which Mr. King said he hopes to introduce next year. Bicycle components are incorporating troublesome plastics, as well. Trek used Bureo nylon to re-engineer its best-selling Bat Cage water bottle holder earlier this year, and and began making mud guards for all its electric mountain bikes out of recycled ocean-bound plastic in September. “There are many other applications as well — we’re looking at bicycle saddles, grips, fenders,” said Stefan Berggren, a senior product compliance engineer at Trek. “We’ve challenged all our product groups.” These are early days, however, and the new products use only a tiny quantity of the plastic currently threatening ocean life. Eric Bjorling, the director of brand marketing and public relations at Trek, is nevertheless hopeful the initiative will grow. “Small hinges swing big doors: That’s a Trek-ism we use around here,” he said. Most people involved with recycling ocean-bound plastic stress the importance of expanding supply chains so they can capture more material, while also driving demand among manufacturers to use it. “The intention is really good,” said Graham Forbes, a global project leader focused on plastics at Greenpeace. However, “those supply chains, at least in the next 20 or 30 years, are never going to be able to catch up with the vast amount of production. In some ways, it reinforces the illusion that we can continue to use plastic in the throwaway model.” The organization is pushing for something more effective, he said: “Simply using less plastic.” Ikea is one NextWave company doing just that. In June, furniture giant introduced Musselblomma, its first small collection of products made with ocean plastic. Comprising a reusable bag, cushion cover and tablecloth designed by Studio Inma Bermúdez, in Valencia, Spain, the collection is made partly from plastic waste pulled out of the Mediterranean Sea by Spanish fishermen. At the same time, the company has committed to removing all single-use plastics from its range by the beginning of 2020. “That’s the plastic straws, freezer bags, garbage bags and a number of other items, both those that we sell in our stores, but also the plastic items we use in the restaurants and bistros in all of our stores, globally,” said Caroline Reid, Ikea’s sustainability development manager. These efforts are part of Ikea’s larger goal, Ms. Reid said, to become “a circular business by 2030,” using only renewable and recycled materials. “It’s really about eliminating waste,” she said, “and making sure we live within the limits of our planet.”",1.5
2379798,Oxygen on Mars Adds to Atmospheric Mysteries,"After a perplexing methane burst was measured by NASA’s Curiosity rover earlier this year, scientists were surprised again by variations in atmospheric oxygen. There is not much air on Mars — the atmospheric pressure there is less than one one-hundredth of what we breathe on Earth — but what little is there has baffled planetary scientists. Oxygen, which makes up about 0.13 percent of the Martian atmosphere, is the latest puzzler. In a paper published this month in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, scientists working with data gathered by NASA’s Curiosity rover reported that levels of oxygen unexpectedly varied with the seasons on Mars, at least in the neighborhood that Curiosity has been driving around since 2012. That follows the rover’s reading earlier this year of a large burst of methane, another gas emitted on Earth by living things and which perplexingly disappeared almost immediately. “It’s confusing but it’s exciting,” said Sushil K. Atreya, a professor of climate and space sciences and engineering at the University of Michigan who works on Curiosity’s atmospheric measurements. “It keeps us on our toes. Mars is certainly not boring.” A Mars year lasts 687 days, so the scientists studying the oxygen variations were able to examine the behavior over almost three Martian years, through December 2017. The level of oxygen “rises relatively higher in the spring,” said Melissa G. Trainer, a research space scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and lead author of the new paper, “and then it comes down lower, below what we would expect later in the year.” Carbon dioxide is the main ingredient of Martian air, and scientists have understood for decades its ebb and flow. At the poles in winter, it falls out of the air and freezes to ice, then wafts back into the atmosphere as temperatures warm in the spring. High in the Martian atmosphere, ultraviolet light breaks apart carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and oxygen atoms and then closer to the ground, interactions with water shepherd the oxygen atoms into molecular pairs. Because oxygen molecules should be pretty stable, persisting about a decade, researchers expected that the amount of oxygen molecules would remain almost constant. Curiosity’s atmospheric measurements showed exactly that pattern for nitrogen and argon, two other trace gases in the Martian atmosphere. But, for oxygen, the concentrations shot up by a third during spring. “This was a very unexpected result, an unexpected phenomenon,” Dr. Trainer said. “There’s a lot we don’t know about the oxygen cycle on Mars. That’s become apparent.” Adding to the mystery, the cycle was not the same each year, and the scientists could not find an obvious explanation — like temperature, dust storms or ultraviolet radiation — for what changed from year to year. On Earth, most oxygen is generated by the photosynthesis of plants. But so far, for the Mars scientists, that is far down on the list of explanations. “You’ve got to rule out all of the other processes first before you go there,” Dr. Atreya said. More likely sources are chemicals like hydrogen peroxide and perchlorates known to exist in the Martian dirt. “It’s pretty clear you need a flux from the surface,” Dr. Atreya said. “Nothing in the atmosphere is going to create this kind of rise.” But how these chemicals might release and absorb enough oxygen to explain the seasonal rise and fall is difficult to figure out, especially as there are only 19 oxygen measurements over five and a half years. An intriguing possibility is that the oxygen mystery might be tied to another trace gas, methane, that is also acting strangely in the Martian atmosphere. “It’s not entirely clear if there is a correlation or not,” Dr. Trainer said. Since 2003, several teams of scientists have reported large bursts of methane based on measurements from Earth-based telescopes, orbiting spacecraft and the Curiosity rover. Other times, the methane has been largely absent. The presence of methane was a surprise to scientists, because the known processes to create the gas are either biological — methane-producing microbes — or geothermal, which would be a promising environment for life to exist on present-day Mars. Now scientists want to know not only how methane is generated on Mars but how it quickly disappears. In June, Curiosity observed a particularly strong burp of methane — 21 parts per billion by volume. But when it repeated the experiment a few days later, it came up empty — less than 1 part per billion. The European Space Agency’s orbiting Mars Express spacecraft passed over Gale Crater, the site of the rover, just about five hours after Curiosity measured the burst — and did not detect anything. (The same instrument corroborated a 2013 methane burst observed by Curiosity.) “I would say that it seems this spike measured by Curiosity was very short-lived and local,” said Marco Giuranna, a scientist at the National Institute for Astrophysics in Italy who is in charge of the Mars Express instrument. Even between bursts, methane on Mars poses a mystery. Curiosity has measured a low but persistent presence of methane, about 410 parts per trillion, which rises and falls with the seasons. But a newer European orbiter, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, with the ability to measure as little methane as 50 parts per trillion, has yet to see any methane at all since it started taking measurements in April last year. The Trace Gas Orbiter is looking at a region several miles above the ground and Curiosity is taking measurements at the surface. But scientists had thought that methane near the ground would mix through the higher atmosphere within a few weeks. “The science puzzle is that these two lines of evidence just cannot be reconciled,” Oleg Korablev of the Space Research Institute in Russia wrote in an email. Dr. Korablev is also the principal investigator of one of the two Trace Gas Orbiter instruments making methane measurements. Håkan Svedhem, the project scientist for the Trace Gas Orbiter, said: “We know no mechanism that could destroy methane completely in such a short time. So it is really a mystery unless Curiosity sits right on top of the only local source on the planet, and even if it would, that source has to be a small one.” Scientists working on the three missions are planning to make near simultaneous observations of Gale Crater on Dec. 15 and again in late December, Dr. Giuranna said. Next year, four missions are scheduled to be launched toward Mars.

2384328,UPDATE 1-Nigeria holds rates after border closures spur inflation,"(Adds quote, context, detail) ABUJA, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The Nigerian central bank left its benchmark lending rate on hold at 13.5% on Tuesday, after a government decision to close borders with neighbouring countries sent inflation to a 17-month high last month. Central bank Governor Godwin Emefiele told a news conference in the capital Abuja that the decision by the bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) was unanimous. He said the impact of the border closures on prices was “reactionary and temporary” and that the medium-term benefits of the government’s decision outweighed the short-term costs. Emefiele said he would advise the government to maintain the closures in the interests of boosting economic output, which has been recovering relatively slowly in the non-oil sector. “In view of the uptick in inflationary pressures, (the MPC) decided that the balance of risks was in favour of protecting price stability,” Emefiele said, after data last week showed inflation hit 11.6% in October. Emefiele said a central bank decision to set a minimum loan-to-deposit ratio for lenders had helped lift economic growth to almost 2.3% in the third quarter, adding that the policy must be sustained as it had led to a drop in interest rates. Some banks have been caught out by the initiative, incurring penalties from the central bank. The majority of economists polled by Reuters last week predicted that the MPC would keep the lending rate on hold in Africa’s largest economy and top crude oil producer. The central bank has been trying to boost growth by encouraging commercial banks to lend, but it has also kept interest rates high and liquidity tight to support the currency. The bank forecasts economic growth of 2.2% this year, while the International Monetary Fund expects growth of around 2.3%.

2388857,CORRECTED-High-level advisory group recommends EU push for global carbon pricing,"pricing@ (In Nov. 26 story, removes reference to civil society groups in paragraph 3 as they were consulted but did not write the report) BRUSSELS, Nov 26 (Reuters) - A high-level advisory group to the European Commission has recommended that the incoming executive should push for a global carbon pricing system to speed up progress towards net-zero emissions by mid-century. The European Union's new executive, which is due to take office on Dec. 1, has said that a central plank of its push to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 will be to tax polluting industries both inside and outside the 28-nation bloc. The report by industrial groups, which was seen by Reuters ahead of publication, said it was ""clear that incremental change is not sufficient and there is the need to accelerate the uptake of disruptive solutions."" The ""Masterplan for a competitive transformation of EU Energy Intensive Industries"" explores several forms of carbon pricing, including the EU's emissions trading system under which heavy polluters can buy and sell permits to emit carbon dioxide. The scheme, however, only covers emissions in EU member states. While it is not clear which proposals will be taken up by the new Commission, the group recommends that it promote an international carbon pricing mechanism and facilitate an EU-wide debate on how carbon pricing schemes can be implemented. ""Indirect carbon pricing such as reduction targets on carbon footprint of final products sold on the market are worth examining"" as well, the report said. The 68-page report, due to be published on Thursday, goes into detail on how energy-intensive industries such as the metalworking, cement and glassmaking sectors in particular can achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, a goal proposed by the European Commission. Combating climate change is one of the new Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's main policy goals, and she is expected to put forward an ambitious climate policy package called the ""European Green Deal."" Under that deal, a carbon tax has been proposed for foreign companies to shield European firms from competitors in nations where climate policies are less strict.

2395788,Marquette fends off host Kansas State,"Markus Howard didn’t approach his national-best scoring average, but Marquette didn’t need it to earn a 73-65 nonconference victory over Kansas State on Saturday night in Manhattan, Kan. Howard, who entered the night averaging 26.0 points per game, finished with 19 points. Junior forward Jamal Cain came off the bench to contribute a career-high 17 points to go with nine rebounds, while senior forward Sacar Anim added 13 points for Marquette (7-2). Kansas State (5-3) received 14 points from junior guard Cartier Diarra, but leading scorer Xavier Sneed was limited to 25 minutes due to foul trouble. The senior forward finished with 11 points on 2-of-9 shooting from the field as the Wildcats shot 32.3 percent for the night. Kansas State asked Sneed, junior guard Mike McGuirl and sophomore guard Shaun Williams to take turns guarding Howard, who shredded the Wildcats for 45 points last year when Marquette knocked off Kansas State 83-71 in Milwaukee. Howard, who missed Wednesday’s game against Jacksonville due to a concussion, didn’t take his first shot until the 15:37 mark of the first half — when he buried a 25-foot pullup jumper in transition to give Marquette the lead for good. Two minutes later, he swished a 20-footer from the corner with Williams in his face. Howard finished the first half with 10 points, two assists and four turnovers, while sinking his only two 3-point attempts — but Marquette couldn’t have built its 39-26 halftime lead without the marksmanship of others. His teammates went 5 of 9 from 3-point range in the first half, which included 2-for-2 showings by Cain and sophomore guard Greg Elliott. Kansas State pulled within 30-25 with 2:57 left in the half on freshman forward Antonio Gordon’s layup, but Howard canned a 3-pointer and Cain hit both of his treys to push the margin to 39-26 by the break. When Howard picked up his third foul and hit the bench with 16:47 to go, Kansas State took it as a sign to make a move. The Wildcats pulled to within 45-42 on freshman guard DaJuan Gordon’s layup with 13:57 left, which inspired Marquette coach Steve Wojciechowski to return Howard to the floor. Kansas State got as close as 45-44, but Howard canned a 3-pointer and Cain cleaned up a Howard miss with a soaring tip-in to restore a 52-44 lead. Howard left again after picking up his fourth foul with 6:25 to go, but the Wildcats couldn’t get closer than six. —Field Level Media ",3.5
2397628,How cute cookware helped me finally feel welcome in my own kitchen,"Essentials Week spotlights unexpected items that make our daily lives just a little bit better. For years, I didn't like cooking, and I wasn't any good at it.  I've always loved the Food Network and I'm naturally creative, but I found my kitchen radically uninviting — a punishing chamber where recipes as simple as scrambled eggs went to die.  Cooking sucked, and I wasn't sure why anyone in their right mind would endure it daily. When I wasn’t ordering expensive take-out, I munched on fistfuls of stale almonds and glared at the stove, willing it to catch fire as I overflowed with dread, disdain, and despair. Then, I met Mr. Narwhal.  Filling his little blue belly with jasmine pearls made me smile. Named after the iconic character from Elf, my first tea diffuser from Sur La Table was a small self-care purchase made on a whim. I'd never ventured outside of Trader Joe's tea bags before, but the idea of loose-leaf tendrils emanating from an underwater unicorn was spectacular. If I couldn’t cook, at least I’d drink boiled water in style.  After Mr. Narwhal and I got acquainted, I realized just how much I looked forward to my nightly cup of tea. Filling his little blue belly with jasmine pearls made me smile. Slipping him into his cozy bath helped me relax. Cleaning him after each use warmed my heart. And the fact that tea brewing is about as basic as cooking gets? That didn't hurt, either.  I felt like I was succeeding at just one thing in the room I hated.  I was sipping a toasty cup of English Breakfast when it occurred to me that I might extend Mr. Narwhal’s legacy to other parts of the kitchen. I imagined cow measuring cups for making oatmeal, monkey spatulas for box-mix brownies, turtle tongs for a salad, then a sloth towel to clean it all up.  Slowly but steadily, my kitchen filled with tiny, useful faces. At first, it was a daydream — the kind of passing thought that can make a refrigerator-sized aquarium seem like an acceptable substitute for a coffee table. Still, I decided to poke around online and see if there were other animal-themed kitchen items I liked. Slowly but steadily, my cart filled, and my home welcomed dozens of tiny, useful faces. Retailers like Daiso, Animi Causa, Monkey Business, and Amazon devote entire sections of their online marketplace to selling cutesy versions of household goods, from otter-shaped tape dispensers to kitty-cat key holders — and kitchen supplies are a big part of that. Love bears? Have yourself a panda frying pan. Fancy dinosaurs? Treat yourself to a Brontosaurus-shaped ladle. Want a sumo-wrestling eggholder complete with mawashi? Go for it, ya weirdo!  No matter what I wanted or needed, I could always find some utensil, appliance, or container that tickled my whimsical taste. Despite disliking cooking, I found myself eagerly ordering basket after basket of kitschy cookery supplies and then patiently tracking their journeys online. Once my new friends arrived, I'd begin the arduous process of identifying their place in my PeeWee's Playhouse of culinary misadventures — and sussing out how to actually use them.  Of course, all these purchases didn't make cooking that much easier, but it did incentivize me to try being in my kitchen for a change. By stocking a space I loathed with items I loved (and not the cheap wares of my local IKEA), I found myself wanting to practice cooking more and more.  I learned new techniques and short cuts with every experiment, from how to properly crack an egg to testing if a frying pan is too hot. (Turns out, the question you should be asking isn't, ""Does touching it hurt?"") I began to appreciate my failures as much as my successes, eating over-seasoned and under-seasoned foods with equal appreciation for the work it had taken to get them wrong, or closer to right.  Despite being a notoriously messy human, I became meticulous about cleaning up my kitchen. I cared for each and every one of my cooking supplies like precious, dishwasher-safe children. (After all, leaving your innocent Spaghetti Monster colander full of gross, cold noodles overnight just isn't right.) Of course, some items were more useful than others — turns out I'll probably never ""need"" a polka-dotted melon baller — but I gave everything I purchased at least one try, and if I didn't need it, re-gifting was always an option. I'm still an awful cook and I've got a whole lot to learn about financial responsibility (cute stuff ain't cheap!!), but at least I'm having fun in the kitchen. I splurged to my heart's content to make a source of routine anguish into something I actually looked forward to — and it was worth it.  If you're struggling to find enthusiasm for cooking, try buying a Mr. Narwhal, Mrs. Hedgehog, or some other adorable culinary tool of your own. It won't fix every problem (the dinner plate-sized googly eyes on my refrigerator have not made me clean it), but it can make the task feel a little less daunting. And maybe your cooking will improve, too. Mr. Narwhal never complains.",3.5
2402623,Best Performances of 2019,"Even though 10 usually seems like the right number (it’s tidy, divisible, standard), some years it feels woefully insufficient. This is one of those years. With all due respect to the entire history of the police procedural, I’ve never seen one like this rape investigation. More than being interesting, it’s so interested, in the vicissitudes of victimhood and survival, in quiet and restraint. It’s hard to explain how that interest reveals itself, except to say that the people playing cops, accusers and parents create this nexus of frustration, outrage, patience, doubt, empathy, determination and shame. One beautifully written and acted exchange follows another. Danielle Macdonald, Vanessa Bell Calloway, Dale Dickey, Elizabeth Marvel, Annaleigh Ashford, Bridget Everett, Eric Lange: The show lets them all do painterly work, shading even minor characters. Kaitlyn Dever, playing a spiky foster kid whom law enforcement chews up and spits out, is especially good at navigating post-traumatic stress with no GPS. And as a pair of detectives, Toni Collette is self-amusedly made of Kevlar and Merritt Wever is the closest acting gets to emotional stethoscope. Whenever that moment arrives partway through a movie or TV show in which your excitement, curiosity or belief spikes, odds are very good that Lucas Hedges, Hong Chau, Merritt Wever or Rob Morgan has arrived to do the spiking. Everything about them is a sideways thrill. I spent most of “Just Mercy” devastated by its most rueful death-row inmate, only to belatedly realize that it was Morgan who was breaking my heart. He’s got a raw, transparent realness you don’t teach or learn. It takes a certain amount of guts to cast him since that realness could expose what surrounds him, the way it does in “The Last Black Man,” as otherwise vacant. Officially, what Ohashi did with her perfect-10 floor exercise at a college gymnastics meet in January was a solo routine. But somebody made a video of her slingshot leaps and Velcro-tight landings, and in it, you can see her daggone teammates not just cheering her on, but eventually moving with her in synchronicity to choice bits of songs like “Proud Mary” and “September.” They don’t just have the usual tumblers’ spunk. They’ve got rhythm and timing and great taste for that floor-exercise soundtrack. Everybody in this musical, about beached stage actors who crash a small-town dance, worked with an astonishing sense of farce. But Leavel polishes narcissism to marbled perfection. The flailing limbs, the snobby rictus of disgust and self-delight. Remember in May when the Met Gala had lots of people wondering, “What’s camp?” Well, for eight shows a week, it was wearing skintight jungle prints and doing misleadingly titled numbers like “It’s Not About Me.” “Hadestown” is a musical Greek myth, American music mash-up in which Hades is essentially Leonard Cohen, the three Fates are the Labelle trio, and Orpheus is the troubadour who replaced Garrison Keillor on the old “Prairie Home Companion.” But it’s Gray, as Hades’ lady, Persephone, who burned me up. Gray uses precision to amplify jaggedness, want and wrath and to ask and answer an urgent question: If Billie Holiday got dragged to hell, she’d be reborn as Tina Turner’s Acid Queen, right? The best written thing on television of any kind this year also inspired the best acting. She’s a sexual time bomb. He’s a weak priest. Scott’s job is to keep the priest’s lust in tension with his chastity. Waller-Bridge’s is to convince him (and herself) that she’s worth the breaking of his vows. Morality, physics, theology, self-deception and grace pass between them, in halting verbosity and these friezes of guilt and incrimination. Unless a third season happens (Phoebe, don’t do it!), the only place to find the likes of these two again is probably the Bible itself. People who love the first season found this second helping an unnecessary excuse to see Meryl Streep insinuate her way through a wig and fake chompers onto everybody’s last nerve. It was also crucial to discover that Kravitz can sulk, worry, break down and seethe with a soul she’s never been allowed to bare. While Streep and company are doing their gold-medal high jumps, Kravitz takes things where you’d expect a woman thinking about the murder she committed would: under the top. It’s true that Jerome is around for the first three parts of this mini-series about the so-called Central Park Five, but the final installment focuses on the incarceration of Korey Wise, and Jerome and his full, searching eyes change the meaning of the dutiful, scrupulously moral thing we’d been watching. He gives the existential terror some rage and physical imagination and, most impossibly, these glimmers of wonder. There are gimmicks, then there’s what these two have done — grown women playing middle-schoolers surrounded by actual middle-schoolers who manage somehow to keep a straight face. The riot comes in part from the contrast between the adult actors and the kids but mostly from Erskine and Konkle’s studied attitudinal accuracy that, in a single facial expression, can capture awkwardness, cockiness, horniness and chagrin. Officially, the umbrage Kelly took during this one-on-one interview was the performance. But as he stomps around a hotel suite, his giant frame spewing profane self-defense all over, King holds steady. “Robert,” she intones, “Robert …” All journalist, of course, but a lot of profile in courage and a little Dr. Melfi, too. This kid can eye-roll, wear 30 patterns at the same time, deeply develop what’s usually the funny-gay-best-friend sidepiece and supersonically deliver line readings like he’s been acting since the screwball era (he has not; Gatwa is 27). But playing a teenage Brit on the best show about young lust maybe ever, the most important question is: When does he breathe? On March 8, scores of people left a Robyn concert at Madison Square Garden only to travel to the subway station beneath it and resume the show. I’ve yet to die, so I’ve yet to go to heaven. But surely an overcrowded train platform full of strangers all belting “Dancing on My Own” must be a nightly recurrence inside at least one of its gates. 1. Brandi Carlile 2. Alicia Keys 3. H.E.R. 4. Chloe x Halle 5. Post Malone and Red Hot Chili Peppers 6. Cardi B 7. St. Vincent and Dua Lipa 8. Kacey Musgraves 9. Jennifer Lopez 10. Diana Ross If I ever teach a class, I’ll make sure to spend a week dismantling the shocking magic of Zendaya as a physical comedian. She’s playing a sullen teenage junkie, but she’s doing it with more colors than Crayola has crayons. Her face is a wonder of pique and lifelessness, the mask of tragicomedy, basically — on opioids. Even though all of this guy’s YouTube micro-musicals are pretty straightforward (change the lyrics of an old show tune or current-ish pop hit and crosscut them with Trump-oriented news footage), I don’t know how he does it. Not simply the withering wit and the richness of his singing but the hydraulic reactions. Those alone make Joan Crawford seem like Steven Seagal. In February, before she laid her soaring stank on Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s mega hit, Clarkson apologized for any perceivable disservice. But this murder was premeditated: she was barefoot. Anybody who plans to put a hurtin’ on a song does it shoelessly. This man should no more have played D’Urville Martin than the Incredible Hulk should play Kermit the Frog. But Snipes doesn’t care. He’s made Martin such a prissy, sissy macho that you don’t know whether to call the Academy or Vince McMahon. This 10-year-old pockets the movie’s longest, most rigorously conceived sequence from Leonardo DiCaprio, who otherwise owns it. She’s a world-weary child actor on a TV western. He’s a beached hack. And Butters excels at about half a dozen things (weathering his chauvinism and balancing adult wisdom with childlike wonder, for starters) while never losing the idea that she’s also playing a kid who expects the man-baby next to her to act like more of an adult than she is.",4.0
2405302,Christmas Light Display Inspires Teen with Autism to Speak for First Time,"A Florida mother who took her 13-year-old daughter to see their neighbor’s Christmas lights had no idea that the festive display would have such a large impact on the teenager, who has autism. Since Kaitlyn De Jesus was diagnosed with autism at 3 years old, she hasn’t spoken more than two words, her mother Marisabel Figueroa told Today. That all changed on Saturday when Figueroa took her daughter to their neighbor Don Weaver’s driveway — a visit they’ve made daily — to see the elaborate Christmas light display he has set up on his front lawn since 2007. “She got up from the chair and started singing,” Figueroa recalled to the outlet. “She said, ‘Mom! Look at the blue lights. Look at the snowmen. Santa’s coming!’ I started crying. I couldn’t believe it.” The incredible moment was something Figueroa had waited 10 years to witness after learning of her daughter’s diagnosis when she was a toddler. “The neurologist who saw Kaitlyn said she was going to be non-verbal for all of her life,” Figueroa, a single mom who lives in Mulberry and works as a manager at a local McDonald’s, explained to Today. “I refused to accept that.” Over the years, Figueroa said Kaitlyn would speak with visual prompts, but remained primarily nonverbal — even when the mother-daughter duo would make daily trips to Weaver’s driveway to see the musical, 200,000-light display. “Our usual routine is to go after 6 when it gets dark,” Figueroa told the outlet. “Mr. Weaver puts down a special chair just for Kaitlyn and she sits there dancing and tapping her feet.” But this weekend, Figueroa, as well as Weaver and the rest of their neighbors, were in for a true Christmas miracle when Kaitlyn began to verbally express her excitement over the festive lights. “It was the first time she ever talked,” Weaver told Today in disbelief. “This woman came over to me and goes, ‘I’ve never heard Kaitlyn speak,&apos” Figueroa added. “I was like, ‘Well, I’m her mom and I’ve never heard her speak unprompted like that.&apos” Though she said her daughter is “a bit isolated and quiet,” Figueroa explained that their neighbor’s holiday decorations bring out a completely different side of the teen. “At Mr. Weaver’s house, she comes to life. She’s like this whole new entity,” Figueroa revealed. “If only Christmas could be around all year.” “I’m still crying about it,” the proud mom added.",3.0
2406642,ByteDance unit establishes venture with Chinese state media firm,"SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - A unit of ByteDance, the owner of video-sharing platform TikTok, has established a joint venture with a Chinese state media group, official registration documents showed. “The joint venture will focus on partnership in the digital rights of short videos,” a ByteDance spokeswoman said in response to Reuters inquiries about the deal. ByteDance, which is one of China’s fastest-growing startups, has formed a series of partnerships with state media organizations in order to feed its leading news aggregator platform, Jinri Toutiao.

Shandong-based Pengpai Audiovisual was established on Dec. 10 with a registered capital of 10 million yuan, according to the documents. Pengpai is the Chinese name of ThePaper.cn, an online newspaper published by Shanghai Dongfang.

2417185,Amtrak’s new ticket rules won’t let passengers sue in a crash,"Passengers and their survivors won a $265 million court settlement with Amtrak after a 2015 derailment in Philadelphia killed eight people and injured hundreds more. But if such a crash happened today, the victims would not be able to sue. That’s because of a clause the passenger rail line quietly added to its ticket purchases in January, which forces disputes into arbitration with no right to go before a judge or jury. The change is bringing objections from consumer advocates, who note that it covers scenarios ranging from ordinary ticketing complaints up to wrongful death, and even includes minors who had the tickets purchased for them. And it could soon get Congress' attention. The language has flown under the radar so far, but may burst into view when the House Transportation Committee holds a hearing on Amtrak next week. ""It is one of the most anti-consumer and passenger clauses I've ever seen,” said Julia Duncan, senior director for government affairs at the American Association for Justice, which represents trial lawyers. Duncan said Amtrak's arbitration clause is unusually broad and detailed, noting that the policy describes a wide array of possible incidents that would have to go to arbitration. ""Most forced arbitration clauses do not go into much detail about what they cover,"" she said. Airlines are prohibited by law from using mandatory arbitration, but Duncan said it's prevalent across other transportation sectors including bus travel, rideshare and cruise lines. Amtrak spokesperson Kimberly Woods said the clause was added to resolve customer claims more efficiently. She said it won't affect most customer complaints, which are settled directly with the railroad. The change has already caught the attention of at least one member of Congress: Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who said his office is looking into the issue. ""There’s no reason why consumer complaints about Amtrak should involve mandatory arbitration. Consumers might wish to have arbitration … but they shouldn’t be forced to,"" Blumenthal said. He sits on the Senate Commerce Committee, which oversees Amtrak. Consumer advocates say forced arbitration in general hurts customers and takes away their rights. Consumers and workers in all types of disputes fare ""terribly on the whole in the forced arbitration system, because it doesn't have any of the protections that having access to public accountability through a judge or jury process would,"" Duncan said. It can also be harder for them to navigate than the court system, shields information from public disclosure, and often leads to worse monetary outcomes, she said. David C. Cook, a lawyer who represented the plaintiffs in the Philadelphia settlement, said the Amtrak language goes ""far beyond a customary contract where there is negotiation."" Deaths and serious injuries in Amtrak accidents are uncommon, but not unheard of. The Philadelphia crash — in which the train’s engineer pushed its speed to 106 mph on a curve rated for 50 mph — was the deadliest in decades, but not the only recent example. In February 2018, 116 passengers were injured in a South Carolina collision between an Amtrak train and a CSX freight train. A 2017 derailment in Washington state, in which a speeding Amtrak train careened off a bridge and onto a highway, killed three passengers and injured dozens of others. ""The question of whether or not cases of catastrophic injury or death belong in arbitration is a really important policy question,"" said Duncan. But Amtrak's policy also discourages passengers from making formal complaints about small violations, argued Financial Times economic editor Brendan Greeley earlier this year, including ""indignities and fees small enough that it wouldn't be worth it for any single person to dispute alone."" And passengers checking the box on Amtrak’s ticketing website also agree not to band together to file a class action lawsuit, according to the language. The Rail Passengers Association said it's heard from angry passengers, and travelers have also voiced complaints on social media. But passengers bothered by the arbitration clause can do little about it. According to the Rail Passengers Association, which says it expressed concern with Amtrak over the change, passengers could go to federal court and try to prove that federal law bars their particular claim from arbitration. But AAJ's Duncan said victory in that kind of claim is rare. And the agreement says any challenge of the validity or enforceability would itself be settled by an arbitrator and not a court. The only other alternative is for travelers to not ride Amtrak.",4.0
2417232,"As impeachment news churns, Trump's rally talk stays the same","As impeachment fever grips Washington and witnesses’ testimony presents an increasingly damning narrative, President Donald Trump continues to stick to the same script that it’s all just another witch hunt. During a Wednesday rally for the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Louisiana, Eddie Rispone, Trump interspersed his talk with a scattering of indignation at what he called House Democrats’ “deranged, delusional and destructive and hyperpartisan” impeachment inquiry. “Now we go again,” Trump said about the investigation on Wednesday night in Monroe, La., after more than a day of near-silence, during which deposition transcripts were released and Democrats announced public impeachment hearings would begin next week. Trump went after the whistleblower who first brought to light the president’s effort to pressure the leader of Ukraine to investigate the Biden family. He characterized the whistleblower as a partisan, citing old tweets by the person’s lawyer that were unfavorable to the president. Trump on Wednesday maintained his repeated defense that his phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky was appropriate and that there was no pressure to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden in exchange for military aid to Ukraine.  Shortly after reports of the whistleblower complaint were made public in September, Trump released a summary of his call with Zelensky. During the rally, the president again said the partial transcript absolved him of wrongdoing, and he questioned why the whistleblower hadn’t taken a larger place on the impeachment stage since. The whistleblower’s lawyers have publicly said their client has little more to add after the congressional inquiry substantiated — and expanded on — their client’s initial complaint. But Trump’s old defenses had to hold up against a number of new turns this week. Five transcripts of depositions released in the past three days paint a fuller picture of how Ukraine policy was altered in a politically advantageous way. New accounts reveal the shakeups in the foreign-policy community amid the Ukraine scandal, including alarms over a what appears to have been a Trump-ordained quid pro quo.  And Rudy Giuliani — the president’s personal attorney, who has been instrumental in pursuing an investigation into unfounded theories about both the Bidens and Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 presidential election — is lawyering up as his involvement in the scandal deepens. At the rally, Trump didn’t directly address the revelations made before Congress. Rather, he threw at Democrats vague accusations of trying to obliterate values at the core of his base. “On their campaign to transform America, Democrats are becoming increasingly totalitarian: suppressing dissent, defaming the innocent, eliminating due process, staging show trials and trying to overthrow American democracy to impose their socialist agenda,” the president told the crowd of thousands at the Monroe Civic Center. “The radical left Democrats are trying to rip our nation apart,” he said. Though the rally had its fair share of anti-impeachment rhetoric, Trump stuck largely to lauding the state’s Republicans ahead of the runoff election on Nov. 16. At past rallies, he has let his frustrations with the investigations that have followed him throughout his presidency overshadow the ostensible political goals of his talks. A number of Trump’s allies also attended Wednesday’s rally, including Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who joined in the stream of attacks on the impeachment inquiry. “Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trying to impeach him,” Kennedy said. “I don’t mean any disrespect, but it must suck to be that dumb.”",4.5
2420984,Convicted ex-WorldCom CEO Ebbers wins early prison release because of poor health,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the early release from prison of Bernard Ebbers, the former WorldCom Inc chief executive convicted in one of the country’s largest accounting scandals, because of his deteriorating health. Ebbers, 78, has served about 13-1/4 years of his 25-year prison term for orchestrating an $11 billion fraud that led to his now-defunct telecommunications company’s 2002 bankruptcy, at the time the largest Chapter 11 case in U.S. history. He had not been eligible for release until July 2028, but the decision by U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan means he will be freed sooner. Ebbers was convicted in March 2005 on securities fraud and other charges. A federal appeals court upheld the conviction the following year. Caproni’s decision was confirmed by one of Ebbers’ lawyers, Graham Carner, and by the office of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan, which opposed Ebbers’ early release. A spokesman for Berman declined to comment on the decision. In a Sept. 5 court filing, Ebbers’ lawyers said their client was legally blind, suffered from a heart ailment and anemia, had lost 40 pounds (18 kg) in a little over a year, and had become incapable of walking regularly for exercise. They sought “compassionate release” under the First Step Act, a bipartisan law signed last December that lets some older prisoners obtain freedom sooner. Prosecutors countered that Ebbers did not show that his medical conditions substantially reduced his ability to care for himself. They also said his conditions were being “well-managed” by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Ebbers’ request drew support from his trial judge, Barbara Jones, who is now in private practice. In a Sept. 3 letter to the Manhattan court, Jones said that while Ebbers had “inflicted substantial harm on many good people,” releasing him now would show compassion. “Given his serious health problems, Mr. Ebbers has been punished enough,” Jones wrote. A one-time milkman who became known as an exacting, cost- obsessed boss, Ebbers transformed Clinton, Mississippi-based WorldCom into one of the biggest U.S. phone companies through a string of takeovers. WorldCom filed for bankruptcy in July 2002. It emerged from Chapter 11 in April 2004 as MCI Inc, which was later acquired by Verizon Communications Inc. The case is U.S. v.

2422185,Nevada Copper starts production at mine in western U.S.,"(Reuters) - Nevada Copper Corp said on Monday it has started production at its Pumpkin Hollow mine in the western United States, one of the first new mining projects to open in the country in decades. The mine is opening just as copper prices are projected to rise due to increasing demand from the electric vehicle industry. Once seen as a laggard in the global mining industry, U.S. copper deposits have drawn nearly $3 billion in recent investments from small and large miners alike. Nevada Copper spent about $200 million to develop the underground mine, less than 60 miles (100 km) from Tesla’s massive Gigafactory in the state’s northern edge. The mine is expected to produce about 27,000 tonnes of copper concentrate annually. The mine’s operating cost of $1.86 per pound is about 49 percent below current copper prices. The underground mine is expected to operate for about 13.5 years. Nevada Copper plans to finish a feasibility study by the end of next year on whether to construct a nearby open-pit mine. The company controls about 22,000 acres in northern Nevada and says it believes it has expansion potential. The mine was developed amidst a push by U.S. President Donald Trump and other officials in Washington to boost domestic minerals production to reduce the nation’s reliance on rivals. Nevada Copper has agreements to supply all of its copper for the next three years to several parties, including commodities trader Transamine Trading SA. Tesla Inc, SK Innovation Co and other automakers and battery makers are opening or expanding across the United States, facilities that are expected to consume a rising share of copper produced in the country. Rival miner Rio Tinto Plc said earlier this month it would spend $1.5 billion to expand its Kennecott copper mine in Utah. Glencore Plc took control earlier this year of PolyMet Mining Corp, which is developing a Minnesota copper and nickel mine. And Freeport-McMoRan Inc is spending heavily to build out several Arizona copper mines. Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; editing by Philippa Fletcher",4.0
2425637,Union-busting chairman of Samsung Electronics gets 18 months for labor law violations – TechCrunch,"The latest Samsung Electronics executive to go to prison for one of a variety of crimes is Lee Sang-hoon, chairman of the company’s board. A recent investigation unearthed conclusive evidence that Lee conspired with others at Samsung to crush unions and unionizing efforts there, in violation of South Korea’s labor laws. The investigation in question began back in 2013 with the leak of company documents describing methods for combating employee unionization efforts. It was the beginning of a years-long set of interconnected cases that would eventually lead to indictments and jail time for dozens of executives there. The case against Lee Sang-hoon was eventually dropped, but reopened last year when additional evidence was obtained in a raid on the company for a separate investigation. The incriminating documents led to further indictments that year and eventually Lee’s sentencing today (which may still be appealed). The Wall Street Journal first reported the news. Samsung Electronics President Young Sohn was onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin just last week, ahead of Lee’s sentencing but after that of several other executives. Managing editor Matt Burns asked Sohn what happened. He first said those sentenced weren’t part of Samsung Electronics but another related group, then that he doesn’t get involved in the complex legal issues because that’s “their personal affair.” He also said that they are “accused, they’re not proven guilty,” which is true in a way as long as the trial is ongoing (should they choose to appeal), but certainly they have been convicted and sentenced. But Sohn admitted that “it’s really important for any corporation, any size, whether it’s small or large, that you need to have a clear value system and clear ethics, and continue to train your management to make sure that there is a consistency in terms of how they do things.” Unfortunately that value system over the last few years seems to have been quite explicitly and consistently against the formation of unions, to the point where it ran afoul of Korean law. Sohn joined the company eight months ago, well after these troubles started, so it’s fair to see him as coming in to right the ship after a tumultuous few years both legally and business-wise. The convictions may signal that the investigations and scandals are coming to an end, but they are convictions nonetheless, and Samsung’s reputation has suffered immensely from the scale of the crimes its most powerful employees have committed.",5.0
2426702,Indeed: The best tech companies to work for in India in 2019,"Software company SAP has topped the charts as the best technology company to work for in India right now. The German multinational took first place in Indeed's ""Top-rated workplaces 2019"" — a list which named established international names alongside homegrown start-ups among India's best tech employers. Adobe, VMware and Microsoft took second, third and fourth place, respectively, while The Indian Space Research Organization rounded out the top five. The job portal's list of 15 names was based on companies that had received the highest employee ratings on its site. An algorithm was then used to rank the companies overall using a variety of factors such as average rating, number of reviews and history of job openings. While the top spots were dominated by global tech names, the list also featured a high proportion of Indian companies. Myntra.com, Paytm and Flipkart were among the homegrown e-commerce names listed, while IT service providers Mphasis and Tata Consultancy Services also made an appearance. Indeed's managing partner for India, Sashi Kumar said the list highlighted companies that have gone above and beyond to create a welcoming and inclusive workplace. ""Companies that go beyond strategic workplace programs to create a conducive work environment have been seen to have a positive impact on the employee's perception of the organization,"" said Kumar. Such measures have become increasingly important as employees look for more from their employers beyond traditional factors such as remuneration and career progression, Kumar added. According to Indeed, 97% of job seekers in India deem it essential to have insight into an employer's reputation when considering a new job opportunity. Almost two-thirds of would-be employees said they look to online reviews for that information, the data found. ""63% of job seekers say that online company reviews by current and former employees are the most important factor when trying to decide whether to apply for a role at a company, as per an Indeed survey.""",3.0
2426784,Ruth Bader Ginsberg says young people keep her optimistic about future,"Research has shown that people who have an optimistic outlook on life tend to live longer. A recent study found that positive people have a 50% to 70% better chance at making it to 85. So perhaps it's no surprise that that 86-year-old Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg considers herself an optimist. ""One of the things that makes me an optimist are the young people,"" Ginsburg said in a conversation at the New York Public Library Monday, according to Vanity Fair, where she was awarded the Berggruen Prize for Philosophy and Culture. ""The young people that I see are fired up, and they want our country to be what it should be,"" Ginsburg said. She said climate change activist Greta Thunberg and Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai are two young leaders who exemplify this trait. Ginsburg has witnessed a lot of change over the course of her lifetime, and in her 26 years serving on the U.S. Supreme Court. ""The progress I've seen in my long life makes me hopeful that we will continue in that direction,"" Ginsburg told the Stanford Daily in Feb. 2017. Growing up in Brooklyn, New York, Ginsburg's mother worked in a garment factory, and her dad was a merchant. Ginsburg graduated first in her class from Cornell University in 1954, and then attended Harvard Law, where she was one of nine women in a class of 500. (She then transferred to Columbia Law, where she graduated first in her class in 1959.) In 1993, she was appointed to the Supreme Court by Bill Clinton. ""Though we haven't reached nirvana, we have come a long way from the days when women couldn't do things just because they were female,"" Ginsburg said in a speech at the University Of Chicago in September. The gender equality champion said that being a mother and a lawyer in the '70s during the second wave of feminism was a ""a tremendous stroke of fortune for me,"" Ginsburg told the Stanford Daily in Feb. 2017. Ginsburg shared her advice for young people who are eager to make a difference, but don't know how. ""Whatever paid work you pursue, do something outside of yourself that you really care about, that you are passionate about,"" she told the Stanford Daily. ""Whether it's the environment [or] discrimination. Do something that will make life a little better for people less fortunate than you."" This is also what Ginsburg tells young lawyers, specifically: ""Look, all you do is get a good job. You're like a plumber: You get a skill and then you practice that skill. But you'll never be a professional unless you use your talent to help repair tears in the community in which you live.""",3.5

2433254,A reverse gift guide of the best money we’ve ever spent,"At the very end of 2018, we started publishing an essay series called The Best Money I Ever Spent. Less a collection of musings on the best or most underrated or cheapest versions of products, it’s meant to be an exploration of what value means to different people. We’ve now released dozens of installations on everything from hand sanitizer to TSA PreCheck to a week with an alleged literary scammer, with many more to come. Here, at the end of 2019, we wanted to depart somewhat from the format we’ve established. Instead, we asked writers to tell us about the best money they’ve spent on someone else, or that someone else has spent on them. The result is something like a reverse gift guide — while you probably won’t spend $12,000 on someone’s rent this holiday season, the spirit might move you to buy them (or yourself) a plant. I looked at the plant with some apprehension. I’d had a poor record with houseplants: two air plants killed in college; a pothos I murdered by smoking in my room; a grocery store orchid that, after dropping its final blooms, grew stringy and desiccated no matter how devotedly I watered it. And yet. This plant, which C was now presenting to me — as a gift! — was small, its shiny leaves wavy and frilled, with beautiful deep green spots that looked painted on. With a gardening app, we looked up its name: Calathea. It was also called a prayer plant, for the way its leaves moved in response to light — flattening to catch the morning sun, standing straight up in the evening, the matte wine-red undersides of the leaves showing. Later, C would tell me that I’d looked nervous. I was. Skeptical, maybe. We hadn’t been dating long then; it had been just four months. A plant wasn’t the same as getting a pet together, but it held, I thought, a similar significance — there was just too much room for metaphor. I worried about killing it, that I’d kill something of us if it failed to thrive in my hands. But I was good at taking care of my Calathea, it turned out. In my south-facing windowsill, it flourished in the sun. New shoots sprouted up faster than I could count. I dusted its glossy leaves; watered it with care. When it outgrew the pot C gave me, I bought a new one, transplanting it in my living room. Bolstered by my newfound confidence in caretaking, I got new plants — a coin plant, a Phalaenopsis orchid. Managing their complicated watering schedules got me out of bed in the morning. I felt fluid and capable; gratified to be a plant mom. It was good to have beautiful, alive things around me, I understood. Good to be taking care of something. Two years, two repottings, and a new orchid spike full of blossoms later, I’ve come to understand that C had never worried that I was going to kill the plant. The fear had come from me alone — I had believed I was incapable of taking care. That I was stuck where I was. His gift to me was trust: that I could take care, that I could make room for beauty in my life. That I could allow something to grow. — Larissa Pham, poet and critic In 2015, I spent $850 for me and my siblings to go to Burning Man, the hippie-tech fusion festival in Black Rock Desert, Nevada. I’d just received a signing bonus from a fancy tech company I’d dejectedly decided to work for in a fit of post-college financial terror. My younger sister is a festival queen and my older brother is in a bluegrass band. Going to Burning Man, for them, is nothing new. I’m kind of a square and require nine hours of rest in a bedroom that resembles a deprivation chamber, so the experience was a bigger stretch for me. The first three days, I hated it and wanted to leave, but by the end I had fully transformed into one of those goes-to-Burning-Man-once memes and was rolling around in the dirt (I mean dust!) talking to strangers about how we were best friends. The last day, as my sister and I packed up the car to drive back to California and my brother got ready to head to Portland, I told him I would miss him and also that I really liked his shirt (it was long-sleeved and striped and looked soft). He took it off and tearfully gave it to me, a symbol of how much he loved me and also how strung out we all were. It’s one of my favorites — a tattered piece of memorabilia that comes down to my knees that I still wear to sleep all the time. — Zoe Schiffer, reporter for The Verge Our server approached the table as I told my girlfriend, “Order whatever you want.” It felt good to say this wild sentence aloud at what was absolutely a very expensive restaurant in a city neither of us had been to before. It felt especially nice to know I’d be able to pay for it. Growing up, there was an entire week we ate chicken and yellow rice for dinner, the portions getting smaller as the week progressed. One evening my father announced with sincere frustration that “Beanie Weenies weren’t a meal,” but they had to be, because that’s all we’d been able to afford that night. As an adult, I fed myself the way I’d learned as a child: shopping for groceries at convenience stores, deciding that chips and crackers could constitute dinner if that’s what I could manage. It was easier to make jokes about what I ate than to concede that I fed myself garbage not only because I couldn’t afford good things, but because it was embarrassing to admit that I didn’t know how to take care of myself. “Pick whatever you want,” I said to my girlfriend. “Order for both of us, get whatever sounds best.” As she selected our food and wine, appetizers and desserts and espresso, I didn’t sit and worry over the bill. I watched with growing delight as she fed herself, as she enjoyed the meal I was able to provide. Feeding her all that expensive food felt pleasurable to me: I was taking care of a person I loved. Not only that, I was allowing her to take care of me. We shared all our plates. It was the first nice meal we shared together, but it would not be the last. Feeding each other means we’re not only splitting the food – we’re splitting the goodness that comes with loving another person. When I pick up the check, I’m paying for her food, but I’m also investing in the two of us. I’m investing in myself. — Kristen Arnett, author of Mostly Dead Things I’m a skincare aficionado, which is a fancy way of saying that I spend way too much on tiny bottles of moisturizers and serums for my face. It was a habit that started young. Since middle school, my mom has encouraged me to meticulously follow a skin routine, and over the years, my collection has expanded from a small makeup pouch to multiple shelves of products. It’s a problem, especially when brands are so keen on commodifying self-care (and when I’m so keen on buying into it). Right before my move in January from Los Angeles to Washington, DC, I ran out of toner — the second step in my face regimen where I splash on a pleasant-smelling, pore-refining substance. As a going away gift, my best friend Kenny gave me a $30 Missha toner. I was initially grateful, but it wasn’t until a few weeks later, when I pulled the bottle from my stash of moving boxes, that the gift struck a sentimental chord. A toner is used to further purify the skin after you first wash it with soap; it’s like a fresh start for your skin. My first three months in DC were hard: I struggled with homesickness in a place where I virtually knew no one, and I was reeling from the end of a two-year relationship. Applying the toner was refreshing, occasionally painful, and soothing. It felt pure — somehow divorced from the capitalist culture of skincare because it was purchased for me, not thrust upon me through product recommendations and targeted ads. Most importantly, it was a gentle, routine reminder from a friend to take care of myself. — Terry Nguyen, reporter for The Goods I’m a saver. A saver of all things, really, but especially funds. My childhood was rife with in-fighting over bills and excessive purchases and the words “can’t afford.” It’s not that we were always cash-strapped and uncomfortable; it was more that penny-pinching was recommended over spendthrift behavior. When combined with a work ethic that had me chasing extra hours and promotions at every opportunity, by the time I was 25, I had accumulated what others might call a rainy day fund. This is unlike my parents, for whom savings are a long-ago dream. I didn’t talk about how much I had in savings, because I had afforded myself the opportunity to just … not. It wasn’t much, relatively speaking, but it was more than most people I knew. At least my savings existed. My mom in particular has long suffered from the economic downturns that have made it harder and harder to earn a living wage in this country. Taxes and bills don’t stop just because an income does, and eventually, holding onto my childhood home had become literally impossible. That was a frightening proposition for my mom, even as she lived alone and we’d been struggling to keep that house for almost a decade as it was. The thought of her not being able to find anywhere else to live — not having the money for a down payment or first-and-last-month’s rent — became scarier to me than losing the only home I’d ever lived in. So when she needed to move, ASAP, I decided to dig out those savings. And I gave it all to my mom: $12,000 to get her into an apartment. This was more of a loan, since selling our old house would give her the chance to pay me back. But being able to make sure your mother is safe and housed is, to me, the best way to spend your own money, no matter how scary that was for me to see my account balance drop to empty. — Allegra Frank, associate culture editor for Vox My spouse Matt and I married in 2014, when they were still identifying as a man, and when I, feminist as I was, still had the idea that it was their job to do the proposing. I had provided them with my great-grandmother’s diamond with which to make a ring, and teased that if they didn’t propose soon, I was going to do it. It never dawned on me that, by giving them a diamond specifically for marriage, I had perhaps already proposed. We had both internalized that somehow it wasn’t real until they asked me. A few years ago, Matt came out as non-binary, and as our relationship evolves, it has brought further questioning and undoing of the assumptions of who does what in this relationship, one aspect of which is who is the gifter or recipient of sparkling things, who gets to ask and who gets asked. I never got to surprise Matt with my intentions in a grand, romantic way. They never got to be given something beautiful, and their wedding band is much plainer than any of the jewelry they have come to wear. So I went to a jeweler we both loved, chose a ring that fit their style — glamorous and bold and a little goth — and the second it came in the mail I sat them down on our couch and asked if they’d continue to honor me with their love. I wanted them to have that moment, and to have something as pretty as my engagement ring. And honestly, I reveled in being the asker. — Jaya Saxena, staff writer for Eater Gift-giving wasn’t always a strong suit for my last boyfriend, a generally thoughtful man. He had a tendency to make elaborate plan-promises instead of presents, and the scheduling of these plans would be left to me. When this became a source of friction, I started telling him exactly what to get. This would have been fine, except that follow-through remained an issue; I remember yelling through tears about the birthday desk chair I’d asked for months earlier because our dining table chairs were causing me back pain. As a spoiled only child, it’s gross but true that gifts are part of my love language (ew/sorry/ew). I find it embarrassing to place a high importance on gifts from my partner — especially when you share concerns about consumerist culture, whoops — but I felt like an after thought when he didn’t come through. Unfulfilled promises are difficult to navigate in a relationship, what you let go and what you don’t, and it was frustrating to both of us to have the same fight over and over. On our last Christmas together, he beyond pulled it out: tickets to a Neko Case show, a sampler of my favorite candles, a tarot deck, and a copy of David Grann’s book, Killers of the Flower Moon. — Meredith Haggerty, deputy editor for The Goods Sign up for The Goods newsletter.

2435081,"Sierra Leone government must allow pregnant girls to attend school, court rules"," (CNN)A regional West Africa court ordered the Sierra Leone government to lift a policy barring pregnant students from attending school. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) court on Thursday also urged the government to abolish part-time schools for pregnant schoolgirls which rights campaigners say is ""discriminatory."" In 2015, the Sierra Leone government adopted a policy barring pregnant girls from mainstream schools following an increase in teenage pregnancy rates linked to closure schools during the Ebola crisis, according to Equality Now, one of the advocacy groups, which brought the case before the court in 2018. Specialized centers were set up for pregnant students, according to the rights group. ""A girl cannot get pregnant on her own in the first instance. Also, many of these girls come from poor families, and once they lose a year, they will not return to school,""Judy Gitau from Equality Now told CNN. Amnesty International described the judgment as a ""landmark moment"" for thousands of girls who were denied inclusive education because of the ban. Marta Colomer, Amnesty International West and Central Africa Acting Deputy Director Campaigns hopes that the ruling would push other African countries with similar bans to reverse it. ""This also delivers a clear message to other African governments who have similar bans, such as Tanzania and Equatorial Guinea, or may be contemplating them, that they should follow this ground-breaking ruling and take steps to allow pregnant girls access to education in line with their own human rights obligations,"" Colomer said.

2448525,More Than 1 in 5 U.S. Papers Has Closed. This Is the Result.,"Readers across the country told us how they were affected by the decline of local news: “Our community does not know itself.” City Council and school board meetings. Small-town sports and politics. Local government corruption. These are a handful of the news and issues that go unreported when small newspapers close or are gutted by layoffs. Over the past 15 years, more than one in five papers in the United States has shuttered, and the number of journalists working for newspapers has been cut in half, according to research by the University of North Carolina’s School of Media and Journalism. That has led to the rise of hollowed-out “ghost papers” and communities across the country without any local paper. We asked readers living in communities with newspapers that were shut down or gutted to tell us how they had been affected. Here is a selection of their responses, which have been lightly edited. The weekly Mount Dora Topic, in Florida, folded in 2006 after decades of ad competition with dailies north and south of the 14,000-population town. Now those dailies are cutting back, and coverage of Mount Dora is scarce. After years without a strong local voice, our community does not know itself and has no idea of important local issues or how the area is changing and challenged by growth and the impact of climate change. We are a nameless and faceless town defined only by neighborhoods. A few local blogs pick up commercial events that are relayed on Facebook, but aside from that, we only hear of murders and fires and hot-button controversies — the stuff of TV news. — David Cohea, Mount Dora, Fla. Local stories about mayoral races, city and county council races, commissions, library activities and school board decisions are all missing since our local weekly newspaper, The Issaquah Press, went dark. I miss the photos, the letters to the editor, the obituaries and the wonderful tone of the paper that we got every week for 38 years, until it stopped publication in February 2017 after 117 years. — Margaret Buckwitz, Issaquah, Wash. The Tri-Town News in Sidney, N.Y., ended publication a year ago. There is no way to reliably learn about decisions of local governments, or even about the issues being raised. School news, religious news and upcoming and recent events are all lost. Even local advertisements that were helpful in planning for home improvements and gift-giving, not to mention posting local jobs, are gone. — Barbara Renton, Bainbridge, N.Y. I’m the editor, publisher, reporter and office manager for probably one of California’s smallest newspapers: The Ferndale Enterprise. I’m on the cliff, about ready to close, after doing this for more than two decades. We’ve won a boatload of state and national awards, but I, too, am spitting into the wind. We’ve been through costly First Amendment battles, been told we were fake news long before you-know-who started muttering those two words. We’re currently cleaning toilets at two Airbnbs at our newspaper office to keep the presses printing. If we decide to shut the doors after 141 years, it’ll take us a year to wind down, we figure. We have to run out people’s subscriptions: can’t afford to give refunds! — Caroline Titus, Ferndale, Calif. I was the editor and publisher of The Millbrook Independent, which closed its print operation after an eight-year run. We started two weeks after the preceding paper closed, taking local news to a higher plane. We found circulation shrinking and tried migrating to the web, which worked for us but not for readers who didn’t regularly go to our web pages. School boards, town and village boards, county news, local news — it all disappeared. We were a check on governments, on endless environmental and zoning hearings, on budgets that we often published in detail, on misdoings and good doings. There is now a void. No one took up the slack. — Stephen Kaye, Millbrook, N.Y. Our local newspapers, The Republican and the Daily Hampshire Gazette in Massachusetts, haven’t shut down yet but they might as well have closed. Their staffs have been so dramatically reduced that there is little oversight of local government and local businesses. The checks and balances afforded by this don’t exist, and it is only a matter of time before the potentially corrupt realize they will be able to get away with corruption more easily. — Stan Freeman, Northampton, Mass. The Burlington Free Press has not closed, but local issue coverage has been reduced to the point of uselessness. City Council meetings are covered when there is a hot topic on the agenda. Even these get short shrift. It is almost impossible to keep on top of new happenings and to updates to older news. In my opinion, we’re in an era in which the populace makes civic decisions with little or no background information. — Tom Derenthal, Burlington, Vt. A local paper doesn’t have to be truly closed to be closed in effect. Los Angeles is made up of many localities, and a subsidiary of The Los Angeles Times has taken over several local papers in recent years. It owns the Burbank Leader, where only a few reporters cover some issues in a twice-weekly paper. The “grammar” column and large photos dominate it. If you truly want to know what is going on, you need to attend every commission meeting and council meeting in person, and no one has time for that. — Julie D’Angelo, Burbank, Calif. I live in Denver. The Rocky Mountain News closed 10 years ago, and The Denver Post is useless and run by a money company. It is filled with ads, not local news. The Colorado Sun, an online publication, arose from the ashes of The Denver Post’s decline. This is where I now find my local news. They show up for local and state politics and attempt to educate citizens on what our public officials are up to. The reporting is good, insightful and widespread. Before The Colorado Sun emerged, there was almost no coverage of local and state politics by The Denver Post. — Sarabeth Bjorndahl, Denver Our local paper, The San Diego Union-Tribune, was bought by the owner of The Los Angeles Times. It has been a mixed blessing: National and state news has improved, but local coverage has suffered. We regularly have a section of the paper called “California” that is filled with stories from Los Angeles. Most of us here don’t live in Los Angeles for a reason, and don’t care about what is happening there. Fortunately, there have been several online start-ups that are filling the void of local reporting. The Voice of San Diego and the Times of San Diego, coupled with the online versions of the local TV news, seem to do a pretty good job of covering what is going on in our region. One thing I particularly like is that some of the organizations regularly hold community meetings to discuss what is going on, their coverage and what is of interest to the community. That never happened with traditional news organizations. — Bruce Higgins, San Diego The Greensboro News & Record was my local paper. While it hasn’t closed, it is a mere shadow of its former self. It is now owned by a division of Berkshire Hathaway. It barely covers national or even state news. The obits and church news still get covered well. The sections that used to focus on surrounding counties were eliminated years ago. It is harder to even find a copy in public places like stores. I only buy the Sunday paper these days. — Sandi Campbell, Randolph County, N.C. Our town’s weekly, The Concord Journal, increasingly prints handouts and rarely covers anything you might call local news reporting. Many hot issues don’t see print. And now our weekly includes another town, Lincoln, further diminishing its local aspect. I subscribe but finish reading it in about two minutes because there is nothing there. — Judith Hill, Concord, Mass. Our paper hasn’t closed yet, but the Pittsburgh Post Gazette began publishing only three days a week in September. I am retired, as is my husband. His day begins with reading the paper — not online, but sitting in his chair and reading every single word. I don’t know if he will ever read it online. And I know many people feel the same way. It will soon be a lost art — reading at leisure, at the kitchen table, talking about local happenings. — Barb Krause, Pittsburgh I graduated from high school this year, but for the past four years, I worked on my school’s newspaper staff. Each year, there would be one community incident or another, and our publication would cover it and be one of the main sources (if not the only one) for readers instead of commercial publications because they’ve all closed over time. For our publication to be a trusted source for community news was a great learning opportunity, but the lack of a local newspaper outside of ours is unfortunate. — Marianne Nacanaynay, Lynnwood, Wash. Our local newspaper, the Idaho Statesman, hasn’t closed, but it might as well have. There is nothing of value in it, unless you want to read about Boise State football. I worked as a local newspaper reporter for six years, so I know the stories that are missing: government meetings, politics, court stories, cultural events, stories about new businesses and restaurants. Fortunately, the Idaho Press-Tribune, based in Nampa, a city 20 miles west of Boise, is making an aggressive bid to enter the news vacuum in Boise, so local journalism has improved in the last year or so. — Penny Beach, Boise, Idaho A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.

2466747,Boeing supplier Spirit to lay off more than 20% of workforce in Kansas,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co’s (BA.N) biggest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (SPR.N), said on Friday it plans to lay off more than 20% of the workforce at its Wichita-Kansas base as it grapples with halted production and uncertainty over when 737 MAX jets will return to service. The layoffs, amounting to more than 15% of the company’s entire workforce, mark the first major 737 MAX-related disruption at one of the world’s largest aerospace companies, and signals more pain ahead as the 737 MAX’s safety ban ripples across the program’s U.S.-centric supply chain. Cuts of this magnitude also present a major roadblock for Boeing’s longer-term plan to ramp up MAX production once it is cleared to resume commercial flights. Spirit shares closed 4.2% lower on the news, first reported by Reuters. Chief Executive Officer Tom Gentile said the layoffs would affect 2,800 workers at Spirit’s marquee facility in Wichita, with the possibility of more to follow based on what final production rates are agreed with Boeing. Spirit has some 13,000 employees in Wichita, out of 18,000 worldwide. Spirit builds the fuselage, thrust reversers, engine pylons and wing components on the 737 MAX - with the program accounting for more than 50% of its more than $7 billion annual revenue, according to its website. “Spirit has not yet received notice from Boeing on when MAX production will restart or what production rates will be when it does,” Gentile said in a memo to employees. “We are taking these actions to align our cost structure to what we expect will be lower production rates than Spirit’s 2019 levels.” He added that “additional workforce actions” were possible. Previously Boeing’s best-selling plane, the 737 MAX has been grounded since March, following two fatal crashes in five months that killed 346 people, hurling the world’s largest planemaker into crisis. The news of the layoffs came just days after Spirit said it would offer voluntary layoffs to some employees. “We are continuing to meet with the company to find ways to lessen the impact of this situation as much as possible,” said Cornell Beard, president of machinists union IAM District 70. Kansas Labor Secretary Delia Garcia said she was working to bring together available resources to assist impacted workers. Reuters reported last month that furloughs were likely in Kansas if Boeing failed to compensate Spirit for built and stored fuselages after a planned 737 production halt starting this month. The employees affected include a mix of hourly and salaried employees and managers, though some 737 MAX employees could be transferred to other programs, Gentile said. Moody’s warned on Friday that suppliers would be challenged to manage their expense base given the uncertainty over 737 MAX production. With a 4,500 order backlog, the MAX was expected to “support the aerospace supply chain for many years to come,” it said in a note. Reporting by Eric M.

2473993,Opinion | The F.D.A. Is in Trouble. Here’s How to Fix It.,"Some New Year’s resolutions for the incoming boss. The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom. The Food and Drug Administration is in distress. The agency is still the world’s leading regulator of food and medical products, responsible for ensuring the safety of some $2.6 trillion in consumer goods each year. That represents 20 cents of every dollar that Americans spend. But critics both inside and outside the sprawling agency say that the F.D.A.’s standards have been slipping for some time. The effects of that slippage are starting to show. Too many prescription drugs and medical devices are being approved with too little data on how safe or effective they are. And too many other products — like those containing CBD or THC, ingredients found in the marijuana plant — are being sold with no apparent oversight at all. Part of the problem is that the agency has too few resources and too little power to fulfill its key responsibilities. But it has also become profoundly vulnerable to political interference and other special interests. And a revolving door — F.D.A. staffers frequently go on to lucrative jobs at the very companies they were tasked with policing — has hurt the agency’s credibility. So too have a string of high-profile public health crises. In just the past few years, the F.D.A. has been faulted for its roles in the opioid epidemic (regulators allowed too many opioids on the market without properly flagging them as addictive or deadly) and a surge in youth vaping (the agency failed to keep untested e-cigarettes off the market or to establish the safety of these products, as millions began using them). Given all that, it’s worrisome that the F.D.A. spent most of 2019 without a permanent commissioner. It’s also concerning that the person finally picked to fill the post — Dr. Stephen Hahn, an oncologist and researcher who was sworn in last month — has no significant policy experience nor any real record of his views on the agency he’s now in charge of. Dr. Hahn’s predecessor, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, came to the F.D.A. with reams of both, and, despite a mere two-year tenure, received bipartisan praise for his efforts to balance the demands of public health under significant public, political and financial pressures. Dr. Hahn did spend two years as chief medical officer of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, where, according to his supporters, he helped the institution recover from several ethical and financial crises. But the scope of that work was vastly different from what awaits Dr. Hahn at the F.D.A. And he assumes this new role at a particularly tumultuous moment. His boss’s boss, President Trump, was just impeached; a presidential election is underway; and the agency is facing pressure from companies, politicians and patients to loosen its standards and clear more products for market faster. Some of that pressure to speed things up is understandable, especially from patients who are frustrated by a lack of treatment options. But several entities — including drug and device companies seeking easier profits and libertarian groups bent on deregulation at any cost — are exploiting those frustrations in an attempt to substantially curtail the F.D.A.’s already diminished powers. There is a deep tension between groups that want medical products to be proved safe and effective before they are made widely available and those that say that as long as those products pass a bare minimum of safety testing, patients should be able to decide for themselves. “The F.D.A. has been moving in the latter direction under great political and public pressure,” says Dr. Steven Joffe, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania. If that trend continues, the nation may end up with a regulatory agency that’s powerless to make any meaningful regulations. For all its faults and failures, the F.D.A. has traditionally done a great deal to balance access to innovations with protection from danger or fraud. To maintain that balance, the agency needs to be made stronger, not weaker. Fortunately, options for fortifying the F.D.A. abound. For instance, laws that would make it easier for regulators to police the cosmetics industry and to hold medical device companies to account have been floating through Congress for years. A group of former F.D.A. commissioners last year proposed an even bolder fix: Restore the agency’s autonomy by extracting it from the Department of Health and Human Services. The F.D.A.’s decisions used to be final, but for decades now they have been subject to layers of political interference. Making the agency independent, as the Federal Reserve and the Social Security Administration are, could help reverse that trend. But for these or other worthy ideas to get a fair hearing, Congress will have to step in, and the president — and the electorate — will need to come to terms with the essential role of regulations in protecting the nation’s food and drug supply. In the meantime, the challenge of steering the F.D.A. will fall to Dr. Hahn. He will not have nearly enough resources to carry out the agency’s stated mission — no commissioner ever does. But he will not be completely powerless, either. Here are four things Dr. Hahn would do well to keep in mind as he takes the reins. Stay vocal. Dr. Hahn’s predecessor, Dr. Gottlieb, managed to keep a spotlight on his chosen priorities — namely e-cigarette regulations and generic drug development — with a relentless and multifaceted public messaging campaign. He tweeted, he blogged, he gave speeches and he communicated openly and regularly with the press. Dr. Gottlieb did not achieve all of his goals — in fact his e-cigarette strategy backfired, badly. But he made the F.D.A. less opaque, and he gave the agency an urgently needed voice. Dr. Hahn will have an easier time defending the agency, and keeping it relevant, if he fosters the same transparency. Slow down on drug and device approvals. The F.D.A. has made several compromises in recent years — such as accepting “real world” or “surrogate” evidence in lieu of traditional clinical trial data — that have enabled increasingly dubious medical products to seep into the marketplace. Dr. Hahn ought to take a fresh look at some of these shifting standards and commit to abandoning the ones that don’t work. That will almost certainly mean that the approval process slows down — and that’s O.K. Stand up for science. As reporting from the medical news website Stat and other outlets suggests, the F.D.A. has become too susceptible to outside pressure. Regulators approved a powerful new opioid at the Department of Defense’s urging, fast-tracked a dubious antidepressant after President Trump praised it, and reversed its decision to reject a muscular dystrophy drug after patient groups complained loudly. Such kowtowing hardly inspires confidence. Scientific evidence (or the lack thereof) needs to be the deciding factor in any final regulations from the F.D.A. That means saying no to politicians and drug and device makers — as well as patients’ groups — when their demands are not supported by the agency’s own findings. It also means holding companies to account when they fail to complete postmarket studies, or when their products prove faulty or dangerous. Follow through on existing commitments. The F.D.A. has yet to issue guidelines for the regulation of increasingly popular CBD products after promising to do so by the end of 2019. E-cigarette makers are supposed to submit their applications for market approval to the agency by May. And a regulatory grace period that the agency granted to so-called stem cell clinics back in 2017 is set to expire this year; when it does, regulators will need to figure out how to police nearly 1,000 businesses selling injections and other treatments that have not proved to work and that have already caused some patients serious harm. Dr. Hahn would build a lot of good will if he showed the F.D.A.’s critics — and the public at large — that he takes all of these deadlines seriously.

2474444,‘Afterward’ Review: Asking for Opinions of Jews and Israel,"A documentary seeks to find out what people think of Jews, the Holocaust and history. When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. “I wonder if any of us have learned from the past,” Ofra Bloch, the director of “Afterward,” says upon hearing the agonizing story of Abir Aramin, a 10-year-old Palestinian girl who was shot and killed by Israeli forces in 2007. Yet when watching Abir’s father speak of forgiveness, and discovering that more than 100 former Israeli soldiers and officers later worked to plant a garden in the child’s name, optimism flickers. Such moments keep this tough documentary from sinking into despair. Bloch was born in Jerusalem, served in the Israeli military and later moved to the United States. To explore her own history, and to better understand rising anti-Semitism around the world, she travels to Germany, where she and other Jews are treated as victims. Elsewhere, she speaks with Palestinians, who curse Israelis as occupiers. The contrasts aren’t lost on the director, who trained as a psychoanalyst and specializes in trauma. She’s an excellent interviewer, asking difficult questions about what her subjects think of Israel, the Holocaust and the Jewish people, then carefully considering the answers. We hear from sympathetic Europeans and a former neo-Nazi; and from Palestinians, some of whom won’t denounce violence, others who promote peace. The resulting emotions are complex, and Bloch, here directing her first feature, can be excused for allowing a few of the scenes to stray. But by the end of the documentary, she and many of her subjects posit that it’s possible to learn from history and to change, and to trust each other a little more. You can’t help but hope they’re right. Afterward Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 35 minutes.",3.0

2479821,"Spanish PM hopes to meet Catalan leader, Madrid to negotiate deficit targets","MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Tuesday he wanted to meet Catalonia’s pro-independence regional leader “as soon as possible”. He also hoped Madrid would start negotiations soon with the European Commission on easing its public deficit targets. Speaking after the first meeting of Spain’s new government, he also said the coalition had approved a decree raising pensions by 0.9% this year in a bid to ensure retirees “do not lose purchasing power”. The government estimated in a statement that the rise in pensions would amount to a cost of 1.41 billion euros in a one-off measure. Sanchez was sworn in last Wednesday, ending months of political gridlock and economic uncertainty after two inconclusive elections in 2019. Days later he announced a government lineup including ministers from the left-wing Unidas Podemos, who will now meet regularly on Tuesdays for cabinet meetings. Sanchez said efforts to arrange a meeting with Quim Torra, the leader of the Catalonia region, were already under way but a date for a meeting had not yet been set. The Catalan separatist party ERC was instrumental in enabling Sanchez to win a confirmation vote in parliament last week, although Torra is not a member of the ERC, and Sanchez has said he will seek to resolve the Catalan dispute through dialogue. The separatist movement in the northeastern region spiraled into political crisis after leaders defied Spanish courts to hold a 2017 referendum on independence. Nine leaders were later sentenced to up to 13 years in prison over their role in the failed independence bid. Lacking a majority in parliament, Sanchez’s government must now forge consensus among a shaky patchwork of alliances to pass laws. Spain lowered its growth forecasts late last year due to domestic and external factors such as trade tensions and raised its deficit estimate. Sanchez said his government would aim to negotiate with the EU Commission to potentially relax public deficit targets, currently approved by Spain’s parliament at 0.5% for 2020. “The economic conditions have changed for some time now, so this is a negotiation process that we will have to open with the European Commission ... and we will start that negotiation as soon as possible,” Sanchez said without giving further details. The head of Spanish Treasury, Carlos San Basilio, said Spain would seek targets that would balance competitiveness with enabling growth. “The commission has been flexible in the recent years, you don’t just come up with one magic number,” he said at an event in Madrid. Sanchez said his government would also carry out its promise of raising Spain’s mininum wage to 60% of the average wage of 23,646 euros per year, but said the measure would take time. “We’ve just started and we have many weeks ahead of us,” Sanchez told reporters.

2482663,"JPMorgan profit gets boost from trading, underwriting","Jan 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co, the largest U.S. bank, posted a 21% rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday, driven by strength in its trading business and higher underwriting fees. The bank's net income rose to $8.52 billion, or $2.57 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $7.07 billion, or $1.98 per share, a year earlier.

2483959,'Our historic duty': Putin plans steps to boost Russia's birth rate,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin announced measures on Wednesday to boost Russia’s birth rate, describing them as vital to the country’s future though they are projected to cost at least $6.5 billion this year alone. Saying the demographic situation was “very difficult”, Putin proposed payments for low-income families with small children, allowances for first-time mothers, higher payments for families with more children and the creation of more places in nurseries. “Our historic duty is to respond to this challenge,” Putin said in a televised state-of-the nation address to Russia’s political elite. “Russia’s fate and its historic prospects depend on how many of us there are... it depends on how many children are born in Russian families in one year, five, 10 years, on what they will grow up to be,” he said. Russia’s population fell dramatically in the 1990s in the tough economic and social climate after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and Putin has faced demographic problems for much of the time since he became president in 2000. Previous attempts to improve the situation have been unsuccessful, causing concern among economists about what the impact of having a smaller workforce will be on the economy. In 2018 the population of 147 million - a figure that includes Crimea although it is not internationally recognized as part of Russia - contracted by 86,000. The finance ministry estimates that the new social pledges made by Putin will cost 400 billion rubles to 450 billion rubles ($6.50 billion-$7.31 billion) this year, and the cost of the policies will increase in coming years. The economy ministry sees total additional costs rising to over 600 billion rubles a year from 2022, but it and the finance ministry do not expect an impact on inflation. The new spending will be on top of 25.7 trillion rubles that Putin ordered in 2018 to be spent on 13 policy areas, known as National Projects”, that included the demographic situation. GRAPHIC: Russia's ""National Projects"" invetment plan - here Russian central bank estimates foresee inflation of 3.5-4% this year. Falling inflation has allowed the central bank to cut its main rate five times in 2019. The finance ministry is projecting a budget surplus of 0.8% of gross domestic product this year, compared with a 1.7% surplus planned for 2019.

2492867,GLOBAL MARKETS-Coronavirus fears weigh on global equity markets,"NEW YORK, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The biggest tumble in Chinese stocks in more than eight months led global equity markets lower Thursday as concern mounted about a new coronavirus outbreak in China. Millions of Chinese are preparing to travel for the Lunar New Year which begins on Saturday, increasing the potential for the disease to spread. The cities of Wuhan and Huanggang, representing a total population of about 18 million people, were put on a travel lockdown to prevent the virus from spreading, a public health measure that the World Health Organization called “unprecedented.” “Ultimately, the coronavirus is a slow-burning but important story for markets that is likely to last for months rather than just a few days,” said TD Securities’ European head of currency strategy, Ned Rumpeltin. European stocks followed Asian markets lower, with pan-European STOXX 600 index down 0.64%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 114.88 points, or 0.39%, to 29,071.39, the S&P 500 lost 9.94 points, or 0.30%, to 3,311.81 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 10.30 points, or 0.11%, to 9,373.47. Airline stocks and casino companies that draw a large portion of their revenues from China led U.S. indexes lower. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.50%. Gold and U.S. Treasuries also rose as investors sought out safer assets. Gold later reversed in Europe as part of a wider fall in metals markets that left copper at a 6-week low and walloped 2% off nickel. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 11/32 in price to yield 1.7325%, from 1.771% late on Wednesday. Deaths in China from the coronavirus rose to 17 on Wednesday, with more than 600 cases confirmed. “The coronavirus has introduced some caution,” said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney. “There is no reason to expect a global pandemic now, but there is some repricing in financial markets.” The Chinese yuan fell to a two-week low, on course for its worst week since August. The Japanese yen climbed 0.2% to secure a third day of gains as the dollar went flat. The euro fell to a six-week low and German bond yields dropped to their lowest in two weeks after European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde struck a slightly more dovish tone than some had expected.

2495307,Iraqi security forces raid protest camps after Sadr supporters withdraw,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi security forces fired bullets and tear gas on Saturday in raids on protest camps in Baghdad and southern cities, killing four people and wounding dozens more, police and medical sources said. The new push to end the sit-in protests and restore order came hours after populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has millions of supporters in Baghdad and the south, said he would end his involvement in anti-government unrest. Sadr’s supporters, who had bolstered the protesters and sometimes helped shield them from attacks by security forces and unidentified gunmen, began withdrawing from sit-in camps early on Saturday after his announcement. Clashes erupted later in the day as authorities removed concrete barriers near Baghdad’s Tahrir Square, where demonstrators have camped out for months, and across at least one main bridge over the Tigris River, Reuters reporters said. In the southern city of Basra, demonstrators began returning to the main protest site following a raid by security forces the night before, burning tires and cutting off a main road, security sources said. At least 16 protesters were arrested. In the capital, at least one person was killed and more than 30 hurt as police and protesters clashed near Tahrir Square. Another three died and 14 were wounded in the southern city of Nassiriya when security forces seized back control of a bridge occupied for days by demonstrators, security sources and medics said. Iraqi security forces have used tear gas and live ammunition against mostly peaceful protesters since the unrest broke out in Baghdad on Oct. 1. More than 450 people have died in the violence, according to a Reuters tally from police and medics. The demonstrators are demanding the removal of what they see as a corrupt ruling elite and an end to foreign interference in domestic politics, especially by Iran, which has come to dominate state institutions since the toppling of Saddam Hussein in a 2003 U.S.-led invasion. Saturday’s multiple raids appeared to be an attempt by authorities to fully clear the sit-ins and end months of unrest. The security operations were launched hours after Sadr said he would halt the involvement of his supporters. Sadr had backed the demands of protesters for the removal of corrupt politicians and for the provision of services and jobs soon after the demonstrations began in October, but stopped short of calling all his followers to join in. Many of Sadr’s millions of supporters, often hailing from Baghdad’s slums, have however been involved in the protests. Sadr’s followers, in a rally on Friday separate from the anti-government protests, called for the removal of U.S. troops from the country. The march dissipated after several hours. Sadr wrote on Twitter late on Friday he would “try not to interfere in the issue (of protesters), either negatively or positively, so that they can shepherd the fate of Iraq.” He did not elaborate. In Basra, protesters urged him to reconsider. In a letter circulated on social media, they called for the support of Sadrists, without which they feared attacks by security forces.

2496467,Chanel walks models through a tranquil cloister garden in Paris,"PARIS (Reuters) - Chanel on Tuesday transported guests from the bling of fashion week to a herb-filled cloister garden where models showed off demure looks in black, white and grey in a nod to founder Coco Chanel’s early years in a nunnery. The designer, who started her clothing label in 1910, spent several years at the Aubazine abbey in the south-west of France as a teenager after her mother died. She learned to sew at Aubazine, which was run by nuns as an orphanage. The nuns’ black and white habits - two recurring colours in Chanel’s repertoire and present in the looks on the runway at Paris’ Grand Palais exhibition hall on Tuesday - are said to have inspired the young designer. The French label is one of the big names presenting one-of-a-kind creations as part of Haute Couture Week in Paris. Chanel’s current creative chief Virginie Viard, who succeeded Karl Lagerfeld after his death last year, paraded a series of buttoned-up looks in sync with the decor as models wound their way around a fountain in the aromatic garden. Some styles in the Spring-Summer 2020 collection echoed schoolgirl uniforms, including patent leather black shoes worn with little white ankle socks. Model Gigi Hadid showed off an especially austere black outfit with a white collar. G-Dragon, leader of the South-Korean Big Bang boy band, French actress Eva Green and U.S. singer Pharrell Williams were among celebrity guests attending the show. Gerard and Alain Wertheimer, the elusive co-owners of Chanel, also attended.

2506179,Zion Williamson is making his long-awaited NBA debut," (CNN)Zion Williamson's long-awaited NBA debut with the New Orleans Pelicans is just a week away. Williamson, 19, is expected to play in his first regular season NBA game on January 22 against the San Antonio Spurs in a home game at the Smoothie King Center, according to David Griffin, Pelicans executive vice president of basketball operations. The college phenom was selected with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft, but he has been sidelined since October, recovering from a knee injury. Williamson underwent arthroscopic surgery on a torn right lateral meniscus on October 21, and he was originally given a 6-to-8 week timetable for return. His return puts him past the return estimate, but the Pelicans have been understandably cautious with his health, considering how important he is to the franchise's future. While the Pelicans have a 15-26 record and are the 14th-ranked team in the Western Conference, they have played well as of late, winning seven of their last 10 games. They're only four games behind the Memphis Grizzlies for the final playoff spot, and a late run to the playoffs powered by Williamson is not out of the question. In four preseason games, Williamson averaged 23.3 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.3 assists in only 27 minutes per game. His presence could give the team a much-needed boost.

2507582,Hawaii shooting: Two police officers were killed after responding to a call for help," (CNN)Two Honolulu police officers were shot and killed when they responded to a call for help Sunday in Waikiki. Following the shooting, a fire broke out at the home the officers had been called to. Three people, including the suspect, remain unaccounted for in the fire. The chaotic crime scene drew the response of local police and fire as well as multiple other agencies, including the FBI and ATF. Now the Honolulu Police Department and the community are mourning their slain officers and searching for the remains of the suspect. A call for help A woman called 911 Sunday morning around 9 a.m. HST and ""said she needed help,"" according to Honolulu Police Chief Susan Ballard. When officer Tiffany Enriquez arrived at the address in a Waikiki neighborhood, a woman who had been stabbed in the leg had already been found by another officer. Enriquez and two other officers walked down the driveway of the home where the stabbing took place. As they walked, the suspect -- identified by police as Jerry Hanel -- began shooting at them, Ballard said during a Sunday night press conference. Enriquez, a 7-year veteran officer with the department was killed in the shooting, according to Ballard. Ballard said that after Enriquez was shot, more officers began to show up at the home. Hanel allegedly opened fire on the second group of officers to arrive, striking Kaulike Kalama, a 9-year veteran with the force, Ballard said. As more officers rushed to the house, ""thick black smoke"" started to pour out of the home, Ballard said. Possible ammunition in the home Firefighters arrived on the scene as flames engulfed the house and licked at other homes, but they were held back by police out of concern for their safety. Ballard explained that it sounded as though ammunition in the home was being set off by the fire.  ""If they had gotten hit by one of those stray rounds, I wouldn't have been able to sleep at night,"" Ballard said. Seven homes were destroyed in the blaze and several other homes sustained fire and smoke damage, according to Honolulu Fire Chief Manuel Neves. Neves said at the press conference that he wasn't sure how many people had been displaced in the fire. Even though authorities opened a shelter to house the displaced residents, none of them needed aid and said they could stay with family and friends, Neves said. As of Sunday night, the fire had been completely extinguished. Both the fire department and police department continue to investigate the scene. Three unaccounted for in fire Police are looking for three people that are unaccounted for -- the suspect and two adult women, Ballard said. Ballard told reporters that the police department will not stop searching for Hanel until they are able to confirm that his remains were in the fire. Hanel is believed to be in his 60's, according to Ballard. Honolulu Police have opened an investigation into two counts of first degree murder, one count of second degree assault and multiple accounts of first degree attempted murder against Hanel, Ballard said. It could take several days to process the scene, which includes recovering the bodies of those unaccounted for after the fire, the chief said. The woman who was stabbed was taken to Queens Medical Center for treatment, Ballard said. She was unsure of the woman's condition. 'They were like my kids' Both slain officers had worked directly with Chief Ballard over the years, she said through tears. Enriquez and Kalama were assigned to District 6 Waikiki with the Honolulu Police Department, Ballard told reporters. ""They were like my kids they were with me for five years,"" she said. ""I knew each one of them very personally.""  ""You know everyday, everyday men and women in blue get up and put on their uniforms and go to work,"" Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell said. ""Officer Enriquez and Kalama put on their uniforms this morning and they didn't get home."" Ballard said the entire department and community is grieving along with the families of the officers she met at Queens Medical Center, where they had been taken for treatment. The chief struggled with how to describe how the families were feeling when asked by a reporter. ""They left in the morning alive and they come to the hospital and find out that their loved ones are no longer around. Very emotional, very emotional,"" Ballard said. A state in mourning News of the officers' deaths was met with an outpouring of condolences statewide. Governor David Ige tweeted, ""Our entire state mourns the loss of two Honolulu Police officers killed in the line of duty this morning."" Democratic Presidential Candidate Tulsi Gabbard also tweeted about the tragedy, saying, ""They paid the ultimate price."" ""Today the city and county of Honolulu and the people of Oahu, almost a million strong, lost two members of their family and we're grieving,"" Mayor Caldwell said. ""This is a family and people are grieving"" CNN's Laura James, Darran Simon and Artemis Moshtaghian contributed to this report.",4.0
2514735,What to Watch For in President Trump’s Impeachment Trial on Wednesday,"With an absent defendant and a tired chief justice, the Senate will begin formal arguments as House managers open their case that the president committed high crimes and misdemeanors. WASHINGTON — After a marathon debate about how to conduct the impeachment trial, the Senate will formally move into the oral arguments phase of the proceeding on Wednesday as the House managers open their case to convict President Trump and remove him from office. The managers will present their two articles of impeachment charging Mr. Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress as they begin what will be as much as 24 hours of opening arguments over three days. With no guarantee of being able to call witnesses later, these three days may be the main opportunity for the prosecution. What we’re expecting to see: Each of the seven House managers, led by Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, will present different elements of the case in a series of speeches. They will have a chance to make their points without being challenged by either senators or the White House lawyers, who will get their opportunity to make arguments later. When we’re likely to see it: The trial convenes at 1 p.m. Eastern and will last through the afternoon and into the evening. If the managers divide their total of 24 allotted hours evenly over three days, the arguments could go until 9 p.m. or later depending on breaks. The White House could pre-empt the arguments with a motion to dismiss on Wednesday morning, but allies said it was unlikely to do so because it does not have enough votes. How to follow it: The New York Times’s congressional team will be following the developments on Capitol Hill and reporters covering the White House will get the latest from Mr. Trump’s defense team. Visit nytimes.com for coverage throughout the day. Even though these will be the official opening arguments, many of the points that will be heard on Wednesday may feel familiar to anyone who hung through Tuesday’s session, which dragged on for nearly 13 hours into the wee hours of Wednesday morning. In theory, the Tuesday debate was about process — will witnesses and documents be sought or not? — but both sides used the discussion to describe the facts and offer their interpretations of what they meant. The challenge for the managers on Wednesday, therefore, will be to introduce their case again in a coherent and compelling way that will capture the attention of 100 senators sitting muzzled at their desks. The advantage for the managers is that they will have the microphone to themselves, at least on the floor. The White House lawyers will not be able to challenge the managers’ assertions but will have to wait for their turn to start, most likely on Saturday. Likewise, the senators, who are bound by a vow of silence, will not get their chance to weigh in until probably next Tuesday or Wednesday, when they will be able to submit questions in writing through Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is presiding over the trial. The only liquids allowed on the Senate floor during the trial are water and milk, but Chief Justice Roberts could be forgiven for wishing for a good jolt of coffee. After presiding over the Senate trial until nearly 2 a.m., the chief justice had to head to his day job later Wednesday, presiding over oral arguments at the Supreme Court at 10 a.m. before returning to the Senate chamber for another session starting at 1 p.m. The arguments at the Supreme Court focused on a different issue than the one at stake on the Senate floor but one that has been hotly disputed nonetheless. The case, Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, focuses on a since-disbanded voucher program in Montana that provided tax breaks for donors to scholarships for private schools, including religious schools. After running the oral arguments at the court in the morning, the chief justice will resume his temporary assignment as presiding officer at the Senate proceeding, a role that so far has been essentially ministerial with the exception of his late-night chiding of both sides to keep civil. The defendant had his say on Wednesday, not from the courtroom, but from television cameras half a world away. During an unplanned news conference in Davos, Switzerland, where he was attending the World Economic Forum, Mr. Trump hurled insults at two of the prominent House managers, calling Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Judiciary Committee chairman, a “sleaze bag” and branding Mr. Schiff a “con job” and a “corrupt politician.” Mr. Trump said he would love to attend his own trial — something his lawyers have advised against — so he could “sit right in the front row and stare into their corrupt faces.” But he said he would be reluctant to allow John R. Bolton, his former national security adviser, to testify because he left the administration on bad terms, “due to me — not due to him.” Aside from the news conference, Mr. Trump was active on Twitter, posting or reposting roughly 100 messages overnight and into the morning. He left Davos after the news conference and was scheduled to land at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington at 4:50 p.m. Eileen Sullivan contributed reporting.",3.5
2517317,"Apple Watch Series 6 rumors: Release date, specs, features to expect","Apple is expected to release a new Apple Watch in 2020, as it&aposs done every year since 2015.The biggest new addition to this year&aposs watch is expected to be sleep tracking, a feature that would help Apple catch up to rivals like Fitbit and Samsung.Otherwise, the next Apple Watch, which is expected to be called the Series 6, is rumored to come with faster performance and better water resistance. Here&aposs what else we know.Visit Business Insider&aposs homepage for more stories.Apple has released a new smartwatch every year since 2015, and there&aposs a good chance 2020 will be no different.


While last year&aposs Apple Watch brought improvements like an always-on display and a built-in compass, the biggest update expected to arrive on Apple&aposs popular smartwatch in 2020 is support for sleep tracking. That&aposs according to Bloomberg, which reported in early 2019 that Apple had been testing such a feature for a possible 2020 launch.It would mark a significant upgrade for the Apple Watch, considering sleep tracking is the one major feature it&aposs lacking compared to rivals like Fitbit and Samsung. That could further establish Apple&aposs stronghold on the smartwatch market. Apple accounted for 47.9% of the smartwatch market as of the third quarter of 2019, according to Strategy Analytics, while Samsung followed with 13.4% and Fitbit placed in third at 11.3%. Here&aposs a look at everything we&aposre expecting to see from Apple&aposs next smartwatch. 













Apple will probably call it the Apple Watch Series 6.










If Apple sticks with the branding it's used since 2016, we can expect its next smartwatch to be called the Apple Watch Series 6. 





The watch will probably be released in September.










Apple typically debuts its new Apple Watch alongside its refreshed iPhones in September, so it seems plausible that the company may take a similar approach this year. In years past, Apple has revealed the new watch on stage during its fall keynote and launched the device in stores later in September, usually roughly 10 days after the launch event. 

 






It may be able to track your sleep.










Apple is expected to bring sleep tracking to the Apple Watch in 2020, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. The Cupertino-based tech giant is said to have been testing the feature at its campus as of early 2019, according to the report. If the feature works as planned, Apple would integrate it into the Apple Watch in 2020. From the report, it's unclear if that means sleep tracking is only being developed for a new Apple Watch model, or if it would be pushed to older watches through a software update. 

 






It'll likely run on a new Apple processor and may offer faster performance.










Apple typically introduces a new processor in each new model of the Apple Watch, as it's done in years past. While there wasn't much of a performance boost when it came to speed between this year's Apple Watch and last year's, Apple said when announcing the Series 4 that it was capable of delivering twice the speed of its predecessor. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who is known for his often accurate predictions about future Apple products, also said he expects the next-generation Apple Watch to offer faster performance, as MacRumors reported. The wireless transmission speeds will also reportedly be faster on the next Apple Watch, says Kuo, which means we may see a boost in Wi-Fi and cellular performance. 

 






The next Apple Watch may offer better water resistance.










You can already go swimming with the Apple Watch Series 2 or later, but Kuo suggests that the next-generation smartwatch will be more water-resistant than the current generation. He doesn't offer any specifics, however. 

 






The Series 6 will run on the newest software from Apple.










Apple's new smartwatches usually ship with the company's latest software, and there's little reason to believe 2020 will be any different. The company usually takes the wraps off its new Apple Watch operating system in June at its Worldwide Developers Conference, so we can expect to get an idea of the new software features coming to the watch this summer.Last year, Apple added new health-oriented features like the ability to monitor activity trends over time and female cycle tracking. It also made it possible to download new apps directly from the watch rather than having to do so from your phone.

2524469,Twitter launches text descriptions for GIFs,"It may not be an edit button (nor will it ever be), but Twitter snuck in a nifty little feature for us to play with heading into the weekend of the Super Bowl. If you've ever looked at Twitter while sports were happening, you've probably seen countless GIFs posted as reactions to big plays. Twitter made that slightly more accessible on Friday, adding the ability to add text descriptions to GIFs. It's an extension of the same feature that has existed for still images for a while. Get those GIFs ready. Starting today, when you Tweet from https://t.co/CuB5qyHKwU you can add alt text to any GIF just like images.Just make sure you have the ""compose image descriptions"" setting turned on in your accessibility settings. pic.twitter.com/NYjOAH9kAx — Twitter Accessibility (@TwitterA11y) January 31, 2020 There are a couple small caveats to this. First, it's only available on web Twitter right now. The Twitter Accessibility account confirmed in the replies to the above tweet that it's coming to Android and iOS soon, but there's no firm date for that yet. If you want to do this, you better open up that laptop. Second, you can't add text descriptions to GIFs or any other images without digging into the settings menu and flipping a switch. Go into the settings page on the Twitter website and, under ""Accessibility,"" you'll find an option labeled ""Compose image descriptions."" That's off by default for some reason, so go ahead and turn it on. 




 Once you've gone ahead and done that, you can start describing GIFs to your heart's content. Just compose a tweet like you normally would, choose a GIF, and then click the prompt to add a description underneath the GIF. It looks a little something like this: 




 This might not seem like a massive upgrade for Twitter, but that doesn't make it less important. These descriptions can help people with vision impairment have a better time on Twitter, and it didn't make much sense to relegate them strictly to still photos.  If Twitter plans to be as GIF-heavy as it's been since adding GIF search, accessibility features like this are going to be necessary.",3.5
2525368,"UPDATE 1-Apple iPhone sales return to growth, pushing profits above expectations","expectations@ (Adds share moves) Jan 28 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday reported sales and profits for the holiday shopping quarter above Wall Street expectations, powered by a rise in iPhone sales for the first time in a year and soaring demand for add-ons like AirPods wireless headphones. But even though Apple executives set a new target of 600 million paid subscribers on its platform by the end of calendar 2020, the company's closely watched services business, which includes its new Apple TV+ streaming offering, missed Wall Street's targets. Apple's total number of installed devices grew by 100 million to more than 1.5 billion over the past year. Apple gave a revenue forecast for the quarter ending in March above Wall Street expectations. But Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters the company was using a wider-than-normal prediction range because of the uncertainty created by the coronavirus outbreak in China, where many of Apple's suppliers are based. Cook said executives plan to discuss more details of how the virus will affect Apple's supply chain on the company's conference call with investors. Apple shares rose 2.7% to $326.15 in after-hours trading after the results were announced. Apple posted $91.8 billion in revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 28, compared with analyst estimates of $88.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company forecast $63.0 billion to $67.0 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March, ahead of estimates of $62.4 billion, showing it believes that its phones and other devices such as AirPods wireless headphones will continue to sell well during what is often a slow time of year. Apples share price has more than doubled since Cook warned a year ago that the company was likely to miss financial targets for its biggest sales quarter of its fiscal 2019. In the year since, Apple slashed prices in China, one of its most important markets, to rekindle sales there. The company also made a push into paid services, rolling out a credit card with Goldman Sachs and subscription gaming and television services last year. Apple reported services revenue of $12.7 billion, below analyst estimates of $13 billion, and up from $10.9 billion the year before. Many investors think that services revenue eventually will boost Apples gross margins, which were 38.35% in the December quarter compared with estimates of 38.06%. The shift toward services, however, depends on Apple continuing to grow its base of users and sign them up for recurring subscriptions that analysts view as potentially more lucrative than hardware sales, which can be inconsistent because they are large purchases that consumers make only every few years. Apple said it now has more than 1.5 billion active installed devices and 480 million subscribers to both its own and third-party paid services, compared with 1.4 billion devices and 360 million subscribers a year earlier. Apple's Cook told Reuters the company expects surpass its previously stated goal of 500 million subscribers for 2020 during the current quarter ended in March, ahead of schedule. Cook said Apple is establishing a new goal of 600 million subscribers by the end of the calendar year. ""We're really proud of 100 million (user) growth in the installed base. That's huge. And that's a testament to the new customers we brought in, the switchers,"" Cook told Reuters. Cook said the company's Apple TV+ subscription streaming video service released last fall was a ""rousing success"" and that it is ""very strong, both the people that are getting it in the bundle and the people that are paying for it that haven't bought a new device."" Solid iPhone sales of $55.96 billion compared with analyst estimates of $51.6 billion and year-before sales of $52 billion snapped a yearlong trend of major sales declines for Apples biggest-selling hardware product. Cook said that the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models drove the growth and also factored into the company's forecast, calling the devices ""the strongest iPhone lineup we've ever had."" But Apples wearables segment which, along with AirPods, also includes the Apple Watch hit $10.0 billion in revenue versus estimates of $9.5 billion, up sharply from $7.3 billion the year before. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note to clients that sales of AirPods alone a metric Apple does not disclose may have reached $3.5 billion to $4 billion in the December quarter, a rise of 150% from the year before. Cook told Reuters that Apple could not make enough AirPods and Apple Watch Series 3 devices to meet demand during the fiscal first quarter and continues to be short on both. Cook said Apple does not have an estimate for when it will be able to fulfill demand for each. ""We're working on both of those very hard,"" Cook told Reuters. For the December quarter, Apple reported earnings per share of $4.99, compared with analyst estimates of $4.55 per share. For the quarter ending in March, Apple forecast gross margins of between 38.0% and 39.0%, compared with analyst estimates of 38.2%.

2530889,"Brittany Broski, Sarah Schauer starting YouTube channel as roommates","Sarah Schauer and Brittany ""Broski"" Tomlinson are two of the most recognizable, funniest online comedians on TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube. Schauer first became popular on Vine and has since built followings across platforms, while Tomlinson shot to instant notoriety with her ""kombucha girl"" TikTok.After getting fired from their jobs the same week, Schauer and Tomlinson moved to LA as roommates and told Insider they're getting ready to take on the YouTube comedy channel scene. Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.As luck would have it, Sarah Schauer and Brittany Tomlinson got fired the same week. 


Afterward, Schauer tweeted that she would be moving from South Carolina to Los Angeles, and Tomlinson slid into her DMs to ask that age-old question – did she need a roommate? Yes, she did. ""Sarah and I met for the first time the day I moved in,"" Tomlinson, 22, told Insider. She goes by Brittany Broski online, but you may remember her best as ""Kombucha Girl,"" thanks to the TikTok that changed Tomlinson's entire life.""She brought everything she owns. But like, our apartment just has a kitchen table. I sleep on a mattress, she has a fully furnished room,"" Schauer, 25, added. ""I sold everything I owned, I still have nothing.""Apartment furnishing differences aside, Schauer and Tomlinson have a lot in common. They're both popular TikTok creators. Schauer started her online comedy career on Vine, where her viral series of exasperated waitress skits propelled her to short-form video notoriety. Schauer also has a popular Twitter presence, and proving that she could maintain a social media following allowed her to start working as a copywriter for brands like BuzzFeed and Smosh.


Once the two moved into their LA apartment at the end of 2019, they realized they could start making content together, and their first duo video on Schauer's YouTube channel – a roommate Q&A with questions crowdsourced from Twitter – was met with an overwhelmingly positive response, after people got over the audio quality.  ""The most common comment on that is 'What the f--- is wrong with your audio?' The second one is like 'This is the funniest thing I've ever seen' or 'I've never actually laughed at a video out loud,"" Schauer said. ""Like now, once we've filmed a video together we've realized that we can make funny stuff that's actually funny.""Schauer and Tomlinson have turned viral moments into careers, and are pivoting toward more collaboration with each otherBoth Schauer and Tomlinson have crafted recognizable, lasting brands of comedy on platforms like Twitter and TikTok, which is no easy feat. Tomlinson wasn't sure that her kombucha-tasting moment would be enough to start an actual career in online humor, and she may be one of the only people to successfully turn a meme into a livelihood.""I was living in a little suburb in Dallas, [the kombucha TikTok] went viral, I got fired,"" Tomlinson said, explaining that her boss at the bank she worked at told her she could either be a meme or a professional. ""So I came out to LA for a week, things went super well, and then the brand deals just started coming in and they haven't stopped, so I've been very, very fortunate.""

Viral fame doesn't usually take the route it did for Tomlinson.Meme stars burn bright in the spotlight until the internet moves onto the next instantaneous star. But Tomlinson kept making TikToks, and demonstrated her comedic range, which includes accents and impressions on top of unscripted moments like the kombucha tasting that made her famous. ""If you think about it, these people get famous and then their 15 minutes are over, and where do they go? That hasn't really happened to me,"" she told Insider. ""People come up to me in bars or whatever and are like 'I love your 'Love Island' impression.' So I know they watch my other stuff. It's cool to see how it's been sustained.""After their roommate Q&A proved the two could be just as funny together as they are apart, Schauer and Tomlinson started making plans to launch a duo YouTube channel. They have a channel name picked out ""that really fits,"" but they're still figuring out exactly what kind of content they'll film and edit together. 


""It'll be tomfoolery,"" Schauer said. ""On Twitter or on TikTok and Vine you can just shoot stuff off and people will be like 'I like that.' YouTube is the hardest because you have to edit and actually plan stuff out.""

Comedy duos on YouTube are nothing new, and Tomlinson cited Cody Ko and Noel Miller as an inspiration. Ko and Miller turned their beloved ""Tiny Meat Gang"" podcast and ""That's Cringe"" YouTube commentary series into a merchandising opportunity, a live tour, and a rap duo that recently signed with Arista Records.Danny Gonzalez and Drew Gooden are two other commentary YouTubers that also took a duo approach to touring (and making comedy music) with the ""We Are Not The Same Person"" song and ""We Are Two Different People"" tour. Gonzalez and Gooden also collaborate on each others' channels. And before their eventual split, internet comedians Elijah Daniel and Christine Sydelko capitalized on their friendship for the ""Elijah & Christine"" YouTube channel. Schauer and Tomlinson are ready to take on the largely male-dominated arena of duo YouTube comedy, as long as they're personally satisfied with the results and their fans want more.  


""It worked out kind of beautifully because we did not move in together with this intention of filming together,"" Tomlison said. ""But for that video to do as well as it did, it's a whole new world of possibilities that's really cool.""Read more:'Kombucha girl' Brittany Broski credits 'gay Twitter' for her viral success, and opens up about being fired for itJaclyn Hill says Jeffree Star has been 'so real and so encouraging' throughout the rocky launch of her makeup brandDavid Dobrik printed his friend's drunk, thirsty texts on a billboard to 'teach him a lesson'Dr. Pimple Popper shut down beauty guru Michelle Phan's claim that burning 'antiviral' essential oils can kill off viruses before they enter your system

2534949,China's Wuhan opens another makeshift hospital to fight virus,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The Chinese city at the center of the coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 700 people across the country opened another makeshift hospital on Saturday, providing 1,500 beds, state media reported. The first medical team has arrived at the Leishenshan hospital in Wuhan and patients will be admitted on Saturday, state-run CCTV reported. It said the hospital has 32 wards and a surgical operating room. Wuhan, capital of central China’s Hubei province, has been converting buildings into hospitals to deal with the high number of patients that have contracted the coronavirus. The city’s first makeshift hospital, Huoshenshan - built from scratch in just eight days - started to receive patients on Monday. Hubei’s health commission said on Saturday that 699 people in the province have died from the disease and it was dealing with 24,953 cases of the virus.

2535318,Australia's iron ore ports cleared ahead of cyclone: Pilbara Ports Authority,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia’s key iron exporting ports have been cleared ahead of a cyclone that is due to make landfall on Saturday, the port authority said on Friday. “The Port of Port Hedland has moved to Cyclone Alert Stage 3 – Clear Port,” Pilbara Ports Authority said in a notice. “The Port Of Dampier has completed Stage 3 – Clear Port and will be moving to shut down,” it said. Port Hedland is the world’s biggest export point for iron ore and is used by BHP Group, Fortescue and billionaire Gina Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting, while Rio Tinto exports out of Port of Dampier. BHP and Rio said on Thursday they were monitoring the situation and making preparations ahead of Saturday, when a tropical low off the coast of Western Australia was forecast to develop into a category 3 cyclone that was set to make landfall in the Pilbara area. “Gales expected on the Pilbara coast this evening or overnight,” the Bureau of Meteorology said in an alert on Friday. “Destructive winds to commence on the coast Saturday morning,” the bureau added. Rio shipped out 327.4 million tonnes of the steel making ingredient last year, while BHP shipped out 240 million tonnes and Fortescue shipped out 173.5 million tonnes.

2538052,UPDATE 3-Trump 'a symptom of a disease'- quotes from the Democratic presidential debate,"(Adds new quotes) By Amanda Becker and Michael Martina WASHINGTON/MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb 7 (Reuters) - Seven candidates vying for the Democratic nomination to take on President Donald Trump in November participated in the eighth presidential debate on Friday. Here are quotations from the contenders on stage in New Hampshire: “This is a long race. I took a hit in Iowa, and I’ll probably take a hit here.” “Bernie has labeled himself, not me, a democratic socialist. I think that’s the label that the president is going to lay on everyone running with Bernie if he is the nominee.” Referring to Sanders’ Medicare for All proposal, Biden said: “Imagine you’re going unite the country, walking into Congress and saying, ‘I got this bill. It’s going provide healthcare for everybody. I don’t know how much it’s going cost. We’ll figure it out later.’ Who do you think is going to get that passed?” “And Mayor (Pete) Buttigieg is a great guy and a real patriot. He’s a mayor of a small city who has done some good things but has not demonstrated he has the ability to – and we’ll soon find out – to get a broad scope of support across the spectrum, including African Americans and Latinos.” “Everybody up here by the way is united; no matter who wins this damn thing, we’re all going to stand together. I believe the way we beat Trump is by having the largest voter turnout in the history of his country.” Sanders rejected criticism that his agenda is too radical to win the general election, saying he could bring people together by “presenting an agenda that works for the working people of this country, not the billionaire class.” “The way you bring people together is by ending the international disgrace of this country being the only major nation on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right.” “Now we have a president who says the economy is fantastic because the Dow Jones is looking good. And I’m sure if you’ve got a building with your name on it close to Wall Street, then that really is the same thing as the economy to you. But the problem is we’ve had an economy grow and not be able to lift up those in most need, or even so many in the middle.” Buttigieg explained why he thinks judgment is more important than time in Washington. “I believe that I have the judgment to help us get through these situations where, obviously, the vice president made the wrong decision when it came to such an important moment in our foreign policy,” he said, referring to Biden’s vote for the Iraq war in 2002 as a senator. “And looking forward, we’ve got to recognize just how much is going to be on the plate of the next president that is different in kind from what we have faced before.” “Election time, year after year, election after election after election, Democrats go to people in the black community and say: Boy we really care about these issues, racism is terrible. We all want to do something. And then, somehow, the problem just seems to keep getting worse. Well I think it’s time we have real, concrete plans that are going to make a difference in people’s lives.” When asked why she was better to lead the country than former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who did not participate in the debate, Warren said: “Look, I don’t think anyone ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination or to be president of the United States. I don’t think any billionaire ought to be able to do it, and I don’t think people who suck up to billionaires in order to fund their campaigns ought to do it.” “It is easy to go after Washington because that’s a popular thing to do. It is much harder to lead and much harder to take those difficult positions,” Klobuchar said to rival Pete Buttigieg. “But what you said Pete as you were campaigning through Iowa as three of us were jurors in the impeachment hearing, you said it was exhausting to watch and that you wanted to turn the channel and watch cartoons.” “We have a president that literally blames everyone in the world, and we have not talked about this enough. He blames Barack Obama for everything that goes wrong, he blames his Federal Reserve chair that he appointed himself. He blames the king of Denmark. Who does that? He blames the prime minister of Canada, for, he claims, cutting him out of the Canadian version of ‘Home Alone 2.’ Who does that? That’s what Donald Trump does.” “We’re going to have to take Mr. Trump down on the economy. Because if you listen to him, he’s crowing about it every single day, and he’s going to beat us unless we can take him down on the economy, stupid. And that’s the issue here, it is not about who has the best healthcare plan. All the healthcare plans are better, a million times better. The question is, who can go toe-to-toe with Mr. Trump, who can take down Mr. Trump, because he’s the real threat to the country.” “Donald Trump is not the cause of all our problems, and we’re making a mistake when we act like he is. He is a symptom of a disease that has been building up in our communities for years and decades, and it is our job to get to the harder work of actually curing the disease.” Reporting by Amanda Becker in Washington and Michael Martina

Another post-WWII Marine, Scott was stationed at 8th and I in Washington, DC, where he served as an honor guard at services held at Arlington National Cemetery.Nominated several times, Scott famously told the Academy that he would refuse the award if he won for Patton on philosophical grounds. The role was so iconic, he won anyway.

 






6. James Earl Jones

People returned to work in China after an extended new year holiday even as the country grappled with the epidemic that has now claimed more lives than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). ""Some people think the outbreak may have a very decelerating impact on growth in China specifically,"" said Peter Kenny, founder at Kenny's Commentary LLC and Strategic Board Solutions LLC in New York. ""But at the end of the day, corporate earnings and U.S. economic data are very strong and we're seeing more of that confidence being priced into stock performances."" Wall Street's main indexes slipped from record highs on Friday, but the S&P 500 posted its best week in eight months. Of the 324 S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results so far, about 71% have beaten earnings estimates, which is above the long-term average of 65%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. At 11:34 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 81.65 points, or 0.28%, at 29,184.16 and the S&P 500 was up 12.05 points, or 0.36%, at 3,339.76. The Nasdaq Composite was up 58.56 points, or 0.62%, at 9,579.07. Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with technology stocks climbing 0.7%. Electric carmaker Tesla Inc rose 2.7% as its Shanghai factory returned to service. Apple Inc fell marginally as analysts predicted China's smartphone sales may plunge by as much as 50% in the first quarter due to store closures and production suspensions following the outbreak. Eli Lilly dropped 2% after experimental drugs from the U.S. pharmaceutical firm and Switzerland's Roche failed to halt Alzheimer's disease. Markets on Monday will also watch for President Donald Trump's $4.8-trillion budget proposal for fiscal year 2021, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's two-day address to the U.S. Congress, starting Tuesday. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.30-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.20-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 33 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 64 new highs and 67 new lows.

2545431,"Meghan Markle, Prince Harry could breach 'Megxit' deal","Meghan Markle and Prince Harry could be in breach of their ""Megxit"" deal if they undertake paid private projects outside the royal family before spring.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are still working members of the royal family until they completely step back in the spring.With reports of Harry and Markle's appearance at a JPMorgan event in Miami and of Harry's talks with Goldman Sachs, it appears they're already working toward financial independence.However, Buckingham Palace has not confirmed whether Harry and Markle were paid by these companies, and it did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.


The Duke and Duchess of Sussex could break their agreement with the Queen by pursuing private work before officially resigning from the royal family.Buckingham Palace announced in January that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle would completely step back from their royal duties and titles this spring.When this new model takes effect, the couple will no longer rely on public funds and will become financially independent.







However, it appears they have already made a start in their pursuit of private work — and if they get paid for these projects before the spring, the couple could be in breach of their agreement.Last week, the couple made an appearance at a JPMorgan event in Miami, a palace representative confirmed to Insider's Darcy Schild.


There, Harry made a speech in which he reportedly discussed mental health, the trauma of losing his mother, and the decision behind ""Megxit.""It was unclear whether this was a paid appearance.According to the Mirror, Harry has also held talks with Goldman Sachs, though it's also unclear whether he's been paid by the company.A public-relations guru suggested to the publication that the couple could earn up to £1 billion ($1.3 billion) through corporate deals and brand-ambassador roles.However, if these deals were to go through before the couple stop receiving public funds in the spring, it could jeopardize the terms of ""Megxit.""


Harry and Markle have not yet completely stepped back from their roles within the royal family and could make a final royal appearance at Westminster Abbey's Commonwealth Day service in March. Though Buckingham Palace could not confirm this to Insider, it did say that ""members of the royal family have been invited"" to attend the service.""The agreement with the Queen technically starts in the spring,"" Richard Fitzwilliams, a royal commentator, told Insider. ""Harry and Meghan have said they want to be financially independent. It is not known whether they were paid for their JPMorgan appearance, but obviously this area is where their future lies.""Connections with Goldman Sachs are likewise likely to be lucrative as the couple are obviously keen not to have to rely on Charles for their funding and also to build their Sussex Royal brand into one of the world's most successful, and heighten their profile as charitable activists as well,"" he added.Harry and Markle are still expected to receive private funds from the Duchy of Cornwall, which is managed by Prince Charles, according to the Daily Mail royal correspondent Rebecca English.However, another royal commentator, Joe Little, told Insider that the couple would likely have some flexibility in their agreement.


""We don't know the specifics of the agreement with the Queen, so it's impossible to say if Harry and Meghan have done something they shouldn't,"" said Little, the managing editor of Majesty magazine.""'Spring' is pretty vague, but I'd imagine there's a degree of flexibility with all the relevant parties,"" he added.Buckingham Palace did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.Read more:How Meghan Markle and Prince Harry could earn enough money to become 'financially independent' of the crown — and why it likely won't include a return to the screenWhy the Queen's eldest grandson Peter Phillips doesn't have to follow royal protocol during his divorceMeghan Markle once wrote about her ideal Valentine's Day, and it shows how she and Prince Harry could be spending it this yearThe Instagram influencer who keeps getting mistaken for Meghan Markle says she doesn't 'see the resemblance'

2547045,Saturday in New Hampshire: Democrats Start Unloading on One Another,"MANCHESTER — Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders spoke back to back to New Hampshire Democrats at a party dinner tonight, grounding their appeals in two very different themes — both of which have a history of success here. Ms. Warren, speaking first, embraced the role of the underdog. Having come in a distant third in Iowa to Mr. Sanders and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and with polls indicating she could face the same fate in New Hampshire, she boasted: “I’ve been winning unwinnable fights pretty much all my life.” Ms. Warren recalled how she confronted executives from her perch in Congress. “Yes, I’m looking at you, C.E.O. of Wells Fargo who got fired,” she said, before invoking her 2012 Senate triumph: “Bye-bye, Scott Brown.” The message was hard to miss: I’ve been counted out before and overcame the odds. If Ms. Warren’s pitch recalled the turnaround of Hillary Clinton, who in 2008 won New Hampshire after being trounced in Iowa, Mr. Sanders evoked memories of past Iowa winners who came into this state with a head of steam, such as John Kerry in 2004. His supporters erupted when he recalled his 6,000-vote margin in the raw vote in Iowa and roared again when Mr. Sanders said he was “confident we’re going to win here in New Hampshire, as well.” The message was hard to miss: Keep up the momentum and they can’t stop us.",3.0
2549743,"Justice Dept. drops probe of ex-FBI official McCabe, a top Trump target","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Friday dropped its criminal investigation of a top target of President Donald Trump, former No. 2 FBI official Andrew McCabe, at the tail end of a week in which the U.S. law-enforcement agency has come under extraordinary pressure from the president. Since he was fired by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions in March 2018, McCabe has often been a punching bag for Trump, and the department’s decision not to charge him could further stoke Trump’s ire. Trump has spent the week criticizing prosecutors, jurors and the judge in a separate case involving his longtime political adviser, Roger Stone, raising questions about whether Trump is eroding the independence of the U.S. legal system. Trump was irked by the decision, said a source close to the White House. He did not comment as he left Washington for his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. McCabe criticized the Justice Department for taking two years on the case, which examined whether he misled investigators about his decision to share internal communications with a reporter during the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors had been indicating since July that the investigation was largely complete. “It is an absolute disgrace that they took two years and put my family through this experience for two years before they finally drew the obvious conclusion and one they could have drawn a long time ago,” he said on CNN. U.S. Judge Reggie Walton said at a hearing in September that the delays made it seem like the department was facing political pressure. A lifelong Republican who worked at the FBI for 20 years, McCabe played a crucial role in the bureau’s investigations of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. In campaign speeches, interviews and tweets, Trump accused McCabe of conflicts of interest because his wife Jill McCabe, a Democrat, received donations for an unsuccessful 2015 Virginia state senate campaign from a Clinton ally. McCabe questioned whether the decision to drop the investigation had anything to do with the ongoing fracas over Stone, a veteran Republican operative who was found guilty in November of lying to Congress, obstruction and witness intimidation. The Justice Department’s decision to seek a lighter sentence for Stone earlier this week prompted all four prosecutors on that case to resign in apparent protest. “Like all Americans I’ve been greatly concerned by what I’ve seen take place in the White House and in the Justice Department, quite frankly, in just the last week,” McCabe said. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. McCabe was fired just hours before he was due to retire, after the department’s internal watchdog issued a report saying he misled investigators from the Inspector General’s office who were trying to determine whether he had improperly shared information with a reporter. The Justice Department under Trump has also dropped its investigations of Clinton and declined to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey. Trump has taken a string of aggressive actions since the Republican-controlled Senate acquitted him of impeachment charges last week. Earlier this week, he abruptly yanked the nomination of Jessie Liu, the senior prosecutor who oversaw the Stone case and the McCabe investigation, for a new top job overseeing sanctions at the Treasury Department. Trump said on Friday he had “the legal right” to interfere in criminal cases, despite an unusual rebuke from Attorney General William Barr, his top law enforcement official. Barr told ABC News that Trump’s attacks made it “impossible” for him to do his job leading the Justice Department, telling ABC News in an interview: “It’s time to stop the tweeting.” Barr said Trump had never asked him to interfere in a criminal case. The president responded on Friday morning: “This doesn’t mean that I do not have, as President, the legal right to do so, I do, but I have so far chosen not to!” he wrote on Twitter.

2550189,"Table tennis: Qatar lends China team a hand with 2,000 balls","MUMBAI (Reuters) - China’s table tennis federation thanked its Qatari counterpart on Tuesday for providing training facilities and equipment, including 2,000 balls, to its national team, who are training in Doha to avoid the coronavirus outbreak at home. More than 42,000 people have been infected by the flu-like virus in mainland China, with authorities confirming more than 1,000 deaths. Almost 30 members of the Chinese squad have been training at Doha’s Aspire Academy Arena since the conclusion of the German Open in Magdeburg earlier this month. With several countries imposing travel bans due to the outbreak, the Chinese Table Tennis Association (CTTA) sought a training facility for its players away from home. It received invitations from Germany, Austria and Japan among others but chose Doha as several of their top players are set to participate in the Qatar Open from March 3-8. “We didn’t expect that they could prepare the venue, tables and facilities for us within such a short period of time,” CTTA President Liu Guoliang said in a statement released by the Internatioal Table Tennis Federation. “The tables that we are using for training are those that will be used at the Qatar Open. “QTTA has even given us all 2,000 that they had in storage for us to train. It might be a common situation in China but it’s very heart-warming, especially during this particular period and we really appreciate all this help from our international friends.” Asian powerhouse China has won 28 out of 32 golds awarded since the sport became an Olympic sport in 1988 and QTTA chief Khalil Al-Mohannadi said he wanted to make sure the world’s best would be playing at the Qatar event. “When I heard about the coronavirus in China, our worry was that the Chinese national team would not be able to play at the Qatar Open,” he said. “For me it is not the Qatar Open and not the World Championships without China.” Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly; editing by Peter Rutherford",3.5

2553886,Bed Bath & Beyond's gloomy sales indicate tough turnaround ahead,"(Reuters) - Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (BBBY.O) were on pace for their worst day ever on Wednesday, as disappointing sales numbers raised concerns on Wall Street that the retailer’s turnaround would take longer and be much tougher than anticipated. Analysts were hoping the home furnishing chain’s new Chief Executive Officer Mark Tritton to quickly overhaul the business after almost three years of falling same-store sales through divestitures, cost cuts and a revamp of merchandise. But after Bed Bath & Beyond’s Tuesday announcement of a 5.4% drop in same-store sales from the first two months of its fourth quarter due to increased promotions and falling store traffic, Wall Street dimmed its expectations. “Tritton has a more difficult job ahead than we anticipated and more aggressive changes are needed. We are disappointed with the large step back in the business,” analysts at Telsey advisory group wrote in a note. Telsey said consumers were not responding well to Bed Bath & Beyond’s products and pricing, and lowered its price target on the company’s stock by $3 to $15. At least four other brokerages cut their price targets to as low as $10. Bed Bath & Beyond’s warning of a torrid final quarter comes just a little over a month after it withdrew its forecast for fiscal 2019. “We are experiencing short-term pain in our efforts to stabilize the business, including the pressures of store traffic trends coupled with our own executional challenges,” Tritton, a former Target Corp (TGT.N) executive, said on Tuesday. Only five out of 18 Wall Street brokerages rate Bed Bath & Beyond’s stock “buy” or higher. Ten rate it “hold” and 3 “sell”. The unusual mid-quarter sales announcement also led to a plunge in earnings expectations with Refinitiv’s fourth quarter SmartEstimate falling to 20 cents per share on Wednesday, compared with $1.05 per share before Tuesday. “Looking ahead, competition remains intense from both online and physical retailers, and it will take significant work to reposition the business to remain viable,” KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Bradley Thomas said. Shares of the company fell 24.4% to $11.22 in premarket trading. Reporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli",4.0
2554584,"FOREX-Asian currencies edge up, take comfort from slower virus spread","* Aussie dollar adds 0.3% but remains heavily sold this year * Yuan, Asia FX advance against dollar and yen * For an Eikon page tracking the coronavirus, click here here * Graphic: World FX rates in 2020 tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E By Tom Westbrook SINGAPORE, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Heavily-sold Asian currencies were modestly firmer on Tuesday, as investor risk appetite recovered with an apparent slowdown in the rate of coronavirus infection, even as the death toll rose. China reported 108 new coronavirus deaths on Tuesday, bringing the total number of people killed in the country to 1,016, yet the number of new cases fell. The Australian dollar, which is highly sensitive to China’s economic health because of Australia’s commodity-heavy export profile, rose 0.3% to $0.6707. It had hit a decade low on Monday and remains nearly 4.5% lower this year. China’s yuan was firm at 6.9773 per dollar and the People’s Bank of China held its mid-point guidance relatively steady, even though the U.S. dollar had gained sharply overnight. “The absolute number of cases continues to climb. That remains a worry. But where the market has taken a bit of comfort is that the rate of infection seems to have come down,” said Bank of Singapore currency strategist Moh Siong Sim. “The other thing that’s been somewhat comforting is that the Chinese currency has gone back below 7 (per dollar),” he said. “That’s been somewhat of a stabilising influence for the rest of the Asian currencies.” The Japanese yen was slightly softer by mid-session at 109.84 per dollar. Volumes were lightened because it is a public holiday in Japan and markets there are closed. The Korean won, Singapore dollar and Thai baht - all recently trampled in a rush to dollars and yen - each advanced on the majors on Tuesday. Yet, as an advance team of international experts arrived in China to investigate the coronavirus outbreak, plenty of jitters remain. The World Health Organization has warned the spread of coronavirus among people who had not been to China could be “the spark that becomes a bigger fire”. JPMorgan has again downgraded forecasts for growth this quarter, as businesses struggle to get back to work and supply chain disruptions bite. The nerves showed in the New Zealand dollar, which languished close to a three-month low at $0.6390 ahead of a central bank policy meeting on Wednesday. The market expects rates to be kept at a record-low 1%, but will be closely parsing the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s choice of words around the coronavirus’ impact. “They will probably leave the easing bias as it is,” said Westpac analyst Imre Speizer. “But there are risks around the way they describe the situation. They could describe it as potentially more severe than others are seeing it, at the same time they may describe it as less severe.” Elsewhere the greenback was marginally weaker against the euro and pound after surging ahead overnight amid fresh signs of divergence between the U.S. economy and Europe. Italian industrial output unexpectedly posted its steepest decline in nearly two years on Monday, after the United States’ surprisingly recorded robust jobs figures last week. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell appears before Congress on Tuesday to begin two days of testimony and is expected to reiterate that the U.S. economy is doing well but that rates can stay low given subdued inflation.

2554699,Want Unlimited Clean Energy? Just Drill the World's Hottest Well,"There’s treasure buried deep beneath the viridescent foothills of Tuscany’s Apennine Mountains, where the stark metal trusses of the Venelle-2 drilling tower mark its location like an X on a map. This geothermal well reaches nearly two miles beneath the surface to a region where temperatures and pressures are so high that rock begins to bend. Here, conditions are ripe for supercritical geothermal fluids, mineral-rich water that exhibits characteristics of both a liquid and a gas. It’s not exactly gold, but if Venelle-2 could tap into a reservoir of supercritical fluids and use them to spin a turbine on the surface, it would be one of the most energy-dense forms of renewable power in the world. But getting there isn’t so easy. Boring deep into the ground risks triggering an earthquake if a large chunk of rock slips out of place. This risk was amplified at the Venelle-2 well, which aimed to breach the K horizon, a poorly understood boundary between the hard rock near the surface and the more pliant rock below. What would happen when the drill punched through this layer into the supercritical fluids below was anyone’s guess. And for now, the mystery remains. Drilling at Venelle-2 stopped just shy of the K horizon when temperatures at the bottom of the well overwhelmed the equipment. Sensors at the bottom of the well indicated temperatures had breached 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit and pressures 300 times greater than at the surface. Nevertheless, Venelle-2 is the hottest borehole ever created, and it demonstrated that it's possible to drill at the extreme end of supercritical conditions. And this week, a paper published in the Journal of Geophysical Research showed that it could be done without producing any major seismic activity. The authors say they hope their study will assuage fears that all geothermal drilling causes earthquakes. After all, the public usually hears about geothermal wells only when something goes wrong.  But Venelle-2 shows that “there are also many positive cases of wells drilled for geothermal purposes,” says Riccardo Minetto, a researcher at the University of Geneva and coauthor of the study. The Venelle-2 well is one of many boreholes that puncture the landscape of the Larderello-Travale geothermal field in central Italy, the same spot where the Earth’s heat was first used to generate electricity. That first experiment back in 1904 produced only enough power for five light bulbs, but today Larderello-Travale produces about 10 percent of the world’s geothermal electricity. In 2015, a consortium of European energy companies and research institutes launched the Descramble project to see if even more energy could be extracted from the geothermal field. The plan was to tap into reservoirs of supercritical fluids deep beneath the surface.  If the energy-dense fluids could be extracted from a well, it would be another historic first for Larderello-Travale. The Descramble team was not the first to go digging for supercritical fluids. Experiments in the US, Japan, Italy, and Mexico have all drilled into conditions that could produce supercritical fluids, which require temperatures above 700 degrees Fahrenheit and pressures 220 times greater than those at the surface. But only one project has actually found supercritical fluids. In 2017, researchers from the Iceland Deep Drilling Project, run by the Icelandic government and a consortium of national energy companies, reported they had reached supercritical fluids 3 miles beneath the surface. Three years later, they are still working on generating useful energy from the well. The Descramble team started drilling Venelle-2 right around the time the Iceland Deep Drilling Project discovered supercritical fluids. They used hardened drilling technology to penetrate regions far hotter than any other geothermal well. But after six months of drilling, they were forced to stop just a few hundred feet shy of their goal. Temperatures at the bottom of the borehole were nearly 200 degrees hotter than what was encountered in the Icelandic well; too hot to safely continue. Throughout the drilling process, an independent team of European geoscientists was monitoring a network of ultrasensitive seismometers placed around the Larderello-Travale geothermal field. The team recorded some seismic activity, but at normal levels for the region. Still, Minetto cautions against generalization. Supercritical geothermal wells are an emerging technology, and he says future attempts at drilling for supercritical fluids “might induce larger seismic events.” Although Minetto acknowledged that no earthquakes have been linked to drilling for supercritical fluids, geothermal wells have caused major earthquakes in the past. Last year, South Korea experienced its second-largest earthquake in history and traced its origin to an experimental geothermal well. A few years earlier, an earthquake that rocked Basel, Switzerland, was also linked to a geothermal well. Some experts blame these seismic events on drilling into faults, which increases efficiency but also carries a much higher risk of triggering an earthquake. As to whether drilling for supercritical fluids carries more earthquake risk than drilling more conventional geothermal wells, Minetto says “there are still too many unknowns about supercritical fluids to give a proper answer.” Even without an increased risk of earthquakes, supercritical geothermal wells have other drawbacks. Reservoirs of supercritical fluids appear to be somewhat rare, which limits their usefulness in transitioning the world to geothermal energy. And the fluids themselves wreak havoc on boreholes by destroying their liners and concrete plugs. “The fluids are very corrosive and dissolve a lot of stuff out of the rock that you need to deal with,” says Susan Petty, president of Hot Rock Energy Research Organization and cofounder of the geothermal company Alta Rock Energy. “It’s scary stuff.” Instead, Petty advocates for building so-called “enhanced geothermal systems” that aren’t dependent on naturally-existing reservoirs of geothermal fluids. These types of wells drill deep into dry, hot rock and inject water from the surface. The water heats up to near-supercritical temperatures and is pumped back to the surface to spin turbine generators. It’s a technique borrowed from the oil and gas industry that promises to free geothermal energy from its dependence on natural hot-water reservoirs. If you drill deep enough, enhanced geothermal systems can be used almost anywhere. The challenges of finding and reaching deep pockets of hot water and steam have limited geothermal electricity adoption around the globe. But if geothermal energy wasn’t limited to locations selected by nature, Petty calculates that it could provide an inexhaustible source of always-on, carbon-free electricity for the vast majority of the world. But like supercritical wells, enhanced geothermal systems have been beset by technical challenges and fears of massive earthquakes. Both the Basel and Korean earthquakes involved enhanced geothermal wells. Whether this is a risk inherent to the technology or the choice of drilling location is an open question. Still, the enhanced geothermal concept has been slow to catch on. In the US, companies like Alta Rock Energy have struggled to attract funding for their capital-intensive projects, which receive a fraction of the federal subsidies allocated for wind and solar energy. As a new technology lacking much of a track record, enhanced geothermal systems also carry substantially more risk for investors. “Geothermal suffers from a bit of a marketing problem,” says Jeffrey Bielicki, leader of the Energy Sustainability Research Laboratory at Ohio State University. “Even though it has a lot of beneficial characteristics, when people say ‘renewable energy’ they’re usually referring to wind and solar.” Earlier this month, the US Department of Energy announced $25 million in research funding that will be deployed at Forge, its dedicated geothermal test site. It’s a start, but geothermal energy systems still have a long way to go before they hit a power grid near you.",3.5
2557548,"Stocks close little changed, but post a gain for the week","Stocks were little changed on Friday, but notched a gain for the week, as Wall Street digested the latest batch of consumer data and earnings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 25.23 points, or about 0.1%, to close at 29,398.08. Earlier in the day, the Dow fell more than 100 points. The S&P 500 gained just 0.2% to close at 3,380.16, but eked out a record closing high. The Nasdaq Composite also advanced 0.2% to 9,731.18 and hit an all-time closing high.  The major averages hit their session lows around midday. They later recovered after CNBC's Kayla Tausche reported the White House is considering tax incentives for people in the U.S. to buy stocks. Despite Friday's muted trading moves, stocks posted back-to-back weekly gains. The S&P 500 and Dow rose 1.6% and 1%, respectively, this week. The Nasdaq gained 2.2%. Those advances come even as investors grapple with a rising number of reported coronavirus cases. China's National Health Commission on Friday reported an additional 121 coronavirus deaths nationwide, with 5,090 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus. The flu-like virus was found to have killed at least 1,380 people in mainland China after the health commission said it had removed 108 deaths from the total figure due to a double-count in Hubei province — the epicenter of the global coronavirus outbreak. It is the second day in a row that the province's data changes have caused significant changes to a nationwide figure, fueling doubts many have about their accuracy. ""Given the uncertainty about how long the COVID-19 crisis will play out, investors are tending to stick with prior winners and those that are less exposed to Asian economies,"" strategists at MRB Partners said in a note. ""This is why select growth stocks, especially in the U.S., have been bid up so aggressively in absolute and, especially, relative terms."" This week, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all climbed more than 2%. Apple, meanwhile, ended the week 1.5% higher.  Core retail sales, which exclude autos, gas, building materials and food services, were unchanged last month, the Commerce Department said Friday. The department added clothing-store sales had their biggest one-month decline since 2009. ""The consumer is beginning to spend less,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. ""If you look at consumer debt, it's been going up and a lot of people have maxed out their credit cards. That would hold back strong spending in spite of the fact that you have cheap gasoline prices."" The data outweighed the release of strong corporate earnings releases from companies such as Nvidia and Expedia. Nvidia shares rose 7% after its quarterly results beat analyst expectations. Expedia got an 11% boost from its earnings while Newell Brands climbed 3%. More than 77% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings thus far, with roughly 72% of them beating analyst expectations, FactSet data shows. ""We're looking now at a very modest positive quarter for the fourth quarter,"" said Jon Adams, investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. ""If we do see earnings growth pick up here, which we think it will throughout 2020, that will bode well for U.S. equities."" —CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this report.",4.0
2559251,Bioterror: We aren't ready  | TheHill,"As the coronavirus explodes within China and the number of fatalities skyrockets, there is growing concern that this may not be a natural event. A Chinese BSL-4 lab connected to the country’s efforts to acquire biological agents from abroad is located close to Wuhan, the city where the outbreak originated. The proximity of the lab to the epicenter of the virus is troubling and warrants serious questions, but regardless of whether the outbreak ultimately turns out to be naturally occurring, the global crisis raises a critical question. If this were a bioweapons attack, would we be ready? If for example, Iran, in retaliation for recent American actions including the killing of General Qassem Soleimani, were to unleash a biological attack, would we be prepared? If smallpox — perhaps the greatest killer in the history of mankind — were used as a weapon against us, would we be able to respond? The answer, unfortunately, is a resounding “No.” Ever since the Anthrax attacks almost two decades ago, we have talked a great deal about bioweapons and bioterrorism. As is the case with far too many of our homeland security initiatives, however, we have achieved far too little. Much of the money we have spent has been wasted. We poured hundreds of millions of dollars, for instance, into biological sensors to be deployed throughout America’s cities, only to find out they worked poorly, if at all. We are now compounding that error by deploying a new wave of sensors, which are unlikely to perform any better. Our defensive measures against bioweapons are fragmented and controlled by a vast array of different agencies and departments, seemingly incapable of unified or timely action. Nowhere is there a sense of urgency. There should be. Amongst nation states, at least Russia, China, North Korea and Iran are believed to have biological weapons programs. Virtually every terrorist group on the planet has some degree of interest in biological weapons. Working with and using biological weapons may seem to the uninitiated to be difficult and expensive. It need not be. The equipment necessary to work with biological organisms can be purchased online. A good lab tech has all the expertise required. We may think of delivery systems for such weapons as being complex. A terrorist group seeking to spread a disease inside the United States might simply infect a number of its members with the disease, have them attend crowded sporting events and allow nature to take its course. We don’t need to waste billions more dollars. We don’t need new agencies. We need intelligence. Waiting for sensors to tell us that smallpox is loose in New York City should not be our first option. Assuming our intelligence fails, we need a system that alerts us quickly in the event that an attack has happened. This means sensors in major cities, and it means equipment better than that we have now. Endless false alarms inevitably mean people start ignoring alerts. Delays in the processing of samples mean we are already behind the curve when an attack is detected. In addition to sensors, we should ensure that we have a regularly exercised capability to compile data from hospital emergency rooms and detect attacks that way. Even if a sensor is not tripped, the compilation of intake information from across cities can, in a very low-tech way, tell us something horrible just happened. Perhaps most importantly, we have to maintain and exercise our response capabilities. We have a large stockpile of emergency drugs and vaccines in what is known as the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). That is a good first step, but it is not enough. Many of the medications in this stockpile expire. They must be replaced. We must also always be doing everything in our power to improve the effectiveness of the medications we do possess and stay ahead of our adversaries. The threat from smallpox is a case in point. While eradicated in the wild, smallpox continues to exist in stores in the United States and Russia. There are also reports that Iran and North Korea keep their own clandestine stockpiles. Beyond that, Canadian researchers have recently demonstrated the ability to make what amounts to synthetic smallpox. Smallpox has a 30 percent mortality rate. It incubates in the human body for two weeks during which time it can be passed from one person to another, but the infected individual shows no symptoms. This means the disease may well outstrip efforts to contain it, and almost a third of the individuals exposed to it will die. Until now. Researchers have now developed an antiviral medication known as TPOXX, which has the ability to cure individuals infected with smallpox and end the threat posed by this ancient killer. The drug has been approved by the FDA, but taking this capability from one that works in the lab to one which we can employ tomorrow if needed means money and commitment. All of us wish we did not live in a world where terrorists and hostile nation states aspire to kill millions with biological organisms. Unfortunately, we do. Twenty years ago, we found ourselves woefully unprepared for the 9/11. Three thousand Americans died as a result. Next time it may be far worse. Next time it may be a pandemic and entire cities decimated by disease. We cannot afford to take that chance. The time to act is now.

2575521,Joni Ernst walks back Joe Biden impeachment comments,"Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), who once called for impeaching former President Barack Obama over his decision to make recess appointments, is now claiming that it’s Democrats who’ve actually “lowered the bar” for impeachment. On Saturday, Ernst said that former Vice President and 2020 contender Joe Biden “should be very careful” with his words around President Donald Trump’s impeachment. “We can have a situation where if it should ever be President Biden, that immediately, people, the day after he would be elected would be saying, ‘Well, we’re going to impeach him,’” she said. According to Ernst, Republicans could impeach Biden for “turning a blind eye” to his son’s work for Burisma, despite being assigned to take on Ukrainian corruption by the Obama White House. Ernst attempted to walk back those comments, telling reporters Monday, “that was taken entirely out of context.” “The point is that the Democrats have lowered the bar so far that … regardless of who it is, if you have a different party in the House than that of an elected president, you can have just random comments thrown out there with folks saying we’re going to impeach,” she continued. But that accusation, that it’s Democrats who have turned impeachment into a partisan weapon, belies her previous call for Obama’s impeachment when she was a member of Congress in 2014. For his own part, Biden said Sunday that Ernst’s threat is just more proof that Republicans are afraid to face off against him in the general election. “They very much don’t want to face me, obviously,” he told the Des Moines Register. But there’s another lesson in this exchange that Biden could be learning. Biden frequently reminisces about the way politics used to be done, when elected officials from both parties could come together and hammer out a compromise for the betterment of the country. For months, he has positioned himself as the candidate who can roll back the American political system to one of mutual cooperation. “I just think there is a way, and the thing that will fundamentally change things is with Donald Trump out of the White House. Not a joke. You will see an epiphany occur among many of my Republican friends,” Biden said last May. Obama also thought that Republicans would come to their senses and work with him on policy after his election. ”My hope, my expectation, is that after the election, now that it turns out that the goal of beating Obama doesn’t make much sense because I’m not running again, that we can start getting some cooperation again,” he said in 2012. Instead, he faced unprecedented obstruction. Not only was Obama’s 2016 Supreme Court nomination of Merrick Garland infamously held up by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), but Republicans utilized several political tricks to hold up the president’s agenda, as explained by Vox’s Matthew Yglesias: Republicans began to use filibuster tactics in unprecedented ways, holding up uncontroversial nominations to eat up precious floor time and refusing to confirm anyone at all to certain posts in an effort to stop agencies from functioning. They weaponized the federal debt ceiling and forced economically damaging austerity budgets on the country only to turn around and embrace budget deficits once Trump was in the White House. Most of all, they orchestrated a series of Benghazi investigations whose purpose they admitted was to hurt Hillary Clinton’s prospects as a presidential candidate while blocking public disclosure of the ongoing counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. The reason why is very simple: There remains little political incentive for cross-party cooperation, as Lee Drutman explained for Vox: In short, if Joe Biden assumes office in 2021, what incentive will congressional Republicans have to work with him? Helping a President Biden achieve his policy goals would help Democrats become more popular. Republicans’ future electoral success would depend on Democrats becoming less popular. It’s the same as when Obama began his second term in 2013. This is why the “fever” didn’t break. It’s also why congressional Democrats immediately went into resistance mode following the 2016 election. Why would Democrats ever work with Republicans to help Donald Trump achieve anything? It’s the same logic, but with a very different emotional feel. Ernst’s original comments, as well as her walk back, show that this is just how politics are. Everything is hyperpartisan and that romantic political age that Biden pines for is probably a thing of the past. But as Vox’s Ezra Klein explained, the vice president’s “idea of who he is was formed in the more collegial Congress of the late 20th century”: In seeing the humanity of his colleagues so clearly, he has lost sight of the structure that surrounds them; 45 years of personal kindnesses, and a career built in the age of mixed parties, can do a lot to obscure the overarching power of polarization.",4.0
2575633,Coronavirus: China delayed reporting the outbreak and the WHO is staying mum,"Nearly six weeks after China announced the coronavirus outbreak, there’s still a surprising amount we don’t know about this newly discovered disease. But one thing is becoming clear: China’s silence in the earliest days of the crisis may have made it worse. Chinese authorities delayed informing the world about the severity of a deadly disease spreading within the country’s borders — even trying to muzzle whistleblowers, like the late Dr. Li Wenliang. Now hailed as a national hero, Li was forced on January 3 by police to sign a letter saying he spread “untrue speech” for warning colleagues about the virus that eventually took his life. With more than 40,500 people infected and 910 deaths, China’s missteps early on seem increasingly fateful. The fact that the international community has not acknowledged those missteps is also consequential. On Friday, President Trump applauded China. “They’re working really hard and I think they’re doing a very professional job,” Trump told ABC News. Meanwhile, the leading global health body, the World Health Organization, has stayed mum about China’s blunders — and is drawing criticism for failing to publicly criticize the country and creating “a false sense of security” about an emerging health crisis. But the reality is this: China’s mishandling and the ensuing silence from the international community is emblematic of how the global system governing the international response to pandemics fails to work, half a dozen global health experts told Vox. Though we have global health laws — in particular, the International Health Regulations, or IHR — meant to guide countries dealing with outbreaks, they’re not actually enforceable. “You can’t penalize [countries that] don’t follow it,” said Devi Sridhar, the chair in global public health at the University of Edinburgh. Instead, the international community has to rely on “soft law and norms” — or “disease diplomacy.” This means that when a pandemic threat looms, the world has little recourse to punish those that fail to live up to the IHR for not detecting a public health problem, or hiding a crisis, even when that mishandling imperils the health of billions. And with just about every outbreak, history repeats. ﻿“Our global outbreak response system depends on the full participation of all actors at all levels of government,” Steven Hoffman, director of the Global Strategy Lab and a professor of global health at York University, summed up. “But our system is only as strong as its weakest link.” Understanding the IHR, and how disease diplomacy is done today, helps explain why. Before we get into the international response, here’s a quick recap of how China delayed reporting the crisis and employed cover-up measures to play down the threat of 2019-nCoV, as the virus is known. On December 31, when China first announced the outbreak of a mysterious pneumonia, officials there emphasized a few things. Most of the patients had been to a food market in Wuhan, the city that’s still the epicenter of the outbreak. They said there was “no clear evidence” of human-to-human transmission, meaning the virus wasn’t yet spreading from one person to another but instead, they suggested, from an animal to humans. And they said the earliest case had shown symptoms only recently — on December 12. Yet, for weeks now, reports in both the scientific literature and local and international news have contradicted what Chinese authorities were telling the world. These reports show the outbreak started weeks or months sooner than China let on, and the virus was already spreading among people — and beyond the food market in Wuhan — in early January. Authorities also censored information and silenced the whistleblowers who tried to sound the alarm. A study published on January 24 in The Lancet showed that in the first days China acknowledge the outbreak, by January 2, more than a third of patients had no connection with the Wuhan food market, including the outbreak’s index (or first) case. What’s more, that person became ill on December 1, nearly two weeks earlier than Wuhan health authorities had said of the first case. Source: Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering This means the virus could have been moving through Wuhan as early as October, Daniel Lucey, an infectious diseases physician and adjunct professor of infectious diseases at Georgetown University Medical Center, told Vox. The Lancet paper also reported that the first person who died from the virus, on January 9, passed it along to his wife a week prior. Similarly, another recent report in the New England Journal of Medicine also shows there were already seven health care workers infected by January 11. “This is the smoking-gun evidence of human-to-human transmission,” Yanzhong Huang, a China expert and senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Vox. “But the public was not kept informed about this situation until January 18,” Huang said. Instead, “People were still told there was no strong evidence of human-to-human transmission.” Meanwhile, Li Wenliang, the physician who had tried to warn his colleagues about the severity of the outbreak back in December, was silenced by police and “forced to sign a statement denouncing his warning as an unfounded and illegal rumor,” according to the New York Times. On February 7, he died of the coronavirus, the China’s People’s Daily reported. And his was just one tragic example of China’s attempts to control the narrative, quiet dissenters, and censor information. (The latest comes in news that Chinese lawyer and citizen journalist Chen Qiushi, who has been reporting critically on the conditions in Wuhan, has disappeared.) That’s not all. Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University, pointed out that while China deserves credit for sharing 2019-nCoV’s genetic sequence shortly after announcing the outbreak, it “has not been forthcoming with additional information about the virus from different samples at different times in different regions.” Nor have Chinese scientists shared the virus itself with other national labs. And yet this information is crucial for understanding “whether the virus mutated, how, and also about its transmissibility,” Gostin explained. What’s more, China refused weeks of offers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and WHO to send experts to China, according to a February 7 report in the New York Times. (Only on February 9 did the WHO announce that a mission for China was finally departing — but it’s not going to Wuhan yet.) I’ve just been at the airport seeing off members of an advance team for the @WHO-led #2019nCoV international expert mission to #China, led by Dr Bruce Aylward, veteran of past public health emergencies. “Then, of course, China has implemented the most extensive cordon sanitaire [or quarantine] in the history of humankind,” Gostin added. “They’ve restricted movements, caused fear and panic. They’ve violated human rights.” Whatever the motivation for this secrecy and delay — China’s rigid bureaucratic structures, its culture of obedience and compliance, an unwillingness by government officials to share bad news, a desire to protect economic interests — the outcome is the same: The world had less time to prepare and react to the new coronavirus, which has likely worsened the outbreak and increased the risk of a global pandemic, global health experts said. “[This] delay in announcing the first cases of coronavirus for several weeks meant that during that time, millions of people traveled outside of Wuhan, so it was precious time lost,” Gostin said. According to the Financial Times, some 5 million people left Wuhan in the weeks before the city was quarantined on January 22, “thus helping to transport the virus all over the country and overseas.” “If the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier,” Li told the Times before he died, “I think it would have been a lot better. There should be more openness and transparency.” If you listened to the World Health Organization director general’s January 30 speech on why his agency was declaring the outbreak a public health emergency, you would not have had a clue about the concerns over China’s lack of transparency and early response. That’s disease diplomacy in action. The WHO’s head, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, praised China, and has repeatedly done so on Twitter and in public statements since. Here’s what he said in the speech: ... the Chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to contain the outbreak, despite the severe social and economic impact those measures are having on the Chinese people. We would have seen many more cases outside China by now — and probably deaths — if it were not for the government’s efforts, and the progress they have made to protect their own people and the people of the world. The speed with which China detected the outbreak, isolated the virus, sequenced the genome and shared it with WHO and the world are very impressive, and beyond words. So is China’s commitment to transparency and to supporting other countries. In many ways, China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response. It’s not an exaggeration. For context, countries under the International Health Regulations are supposed to report outbreaks immediately, take evidence-based measures to stop them from spreading, and uphold human rights in the process. Yet even on January 30, when Tedros made the speech, there was already ample evidence that China hadn’t reported the outbreak in a timely manner, not to mention the human rights questions raised by China’s unprecedented quarantine of more than 50 million people. Some of the global health observers Vox spoke to were surprised by the heavy-handed nature of Tedros’s praise. “It was quite disappointing when there was a clear opportunity for some leadership to be shown on health and human rights and raising questions about [China’s] response,” Mark Eccleston-Turner, a global health law researcher at Keele University in England, said of WHO’s response. “The evidence for quarantining infected people is fairly decent,” he added, “but we are not just talking about quarantining infected people; the overwhelming majority of people in China are not infected with the coronavirus.” Others said Tedros had little choice. “WHO has a difficult balancing act,” said Sridhar. “They have to somehow retain being the lead coordinator and director of international health work and the trade-offs they are having to make are about the greater good. “Right now, the greater good is to create positive incentives for countries to collaborate with WHO — to share data, to let missions into China. If that means publicly [Tedros] has to praise China, I understand it.” “If WHO criticizes China publicly,” Gostin added, “it’s possible they can be less transparent, less cooperative. If I were in Tedros’s shoes, I am not entirely sure I’d do anything differently.” Adam Kamradt-Scott, a professor in global health at the University of Sydney who studied China’s SARS response, agreed. “As the world’s most populous nation, it is in the world’s interest to ensure China remains engaged, that it is transparent about disease events, and that those events are reported as soon as humanly possible.” Chastising China at a pivotal moment in the outbreak may have had the opposite of the desired effect. When asked why the agency wasn’t saying more about the concerns over China’s response, a spokesperson said that while WHO condemns any human rights violations, “WHO’s top priority is supporting the people of China and the world to limit transmission of 2019-nCoV. ... We have a window of opportunity at the present time to slow the outbreak. This is what WHO and countries are focusing on.” The underlying reason for WHO’s silence about China’s missteps: The International Health Regulations don’t actually have any teeth. “We have rules around how countries should behave when diseases cross borders, but because those rules have no enforcement mechanism, when countries do the wrong thing then they tend to get away with it,” Kamradt-Scott said. The IHR — which WHO’s 196 members countries are supposed to adhere to — were revised in 2005 precisely because of China’s mishandling of another outbreak, SARS. Like today, China was heavily criticized for withholding information about SARS, in part because of concerns over the economic repercussions of reporting. The virus eventually killed 774 people and infected more than 8,000 around the world. The revised IHR asks countries to build out their disease surveillance capacities and report public health crises immediately. It also asks nations not yet affected by a new pathogen to avoid punishing those that are through travel and trade restrictions. “These revisions were all about trying to get countries to sacrifice their short-term interests for the long-term well-being of all countries,” Sridhar said. Yet the revisions haven’t changed much. When an expert panel reviewed the response to the H1N1 swine flu scare of 2009, for example, it found the world “ill-prepared to respond to a severe influenza pandemic or to any similarly global, sustained and threatening public-health emergency.” The WHO also struggled to lead the global response (even though it’s supposed to play the coordinating role in the IHR). Ditto the 2014-16 Ebola epidemic, when the three West African countries at the center of the outbreak didn’t have the disease surveillance networks in place to quickly identify the spread of the virus, delaying the global response for months. Then other countries implemented travel and trade bans on West Africa, despite that not being recommended under the IHR. Again, WHO was criticized for doing too little, too late. “We’ve seen travel restrictions with every major outbreak from SARS through to Ebola in West Africa,” Gostin said. With the new coronavirus outbreak, countries around the world — from the US to Russia to Australia — are putting travel bans in place and closing their borders to China. “The IHR operates on mutual trust largely, and it is a mutual trust,” Eccleston-Turner said. “That mutual trust has been eroded over a number of outbreaks where member states have ignored the recommendations from WHO.” There’s even a debate about whether the IHR should be called a set of laws, Sridhar said. “You can contest whether you call it binding legislation if there’s no consequence.” While there’s been some discussion about tying a country’s performance during a pandemic to financial levers, such as World Bank or International Monetary Fund loans, little has happened in the way of reform, Sridhar added. How many more outbreaks, how many more deaths, will it take to change that?",3.5
2577283,"Bloomberg defended stop and frisk, throwing minority kids 'against the walls' in 2015 audio"," (CNN)Michael Bloomberg is heard defending his controversial stop and frisk policing policy in stark terms in audio that was posted on Twitter Monday, with the former New York mayor describing the policy as a way to reduce violence by throwing minority kids ""up against the walls and frisk them."" In the audio, reportedly from a 2015 speech in Colorado, Bloomberg also claims that ""95%"" of ""murders and murderers and murder victims"" are male minorities between the ages of 16 to 25. ""You can just take the descriptions and Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops,"" he can be heard saying. A snippet of the audio was originally posted to Twitter by writer and author and Bernie Sanders' supporter Benjamin Dixon on Monday who went after Bloomberg calling him racist and classist. CNN has reviewed the full audio, which was available on YouTube.   In a statement responding to the audio, Bloomberg focused more on President Donald Trump, who tweeted about the audio, and less on his own comments. ""President Trump's deleted tweet is the latest example of his endless efforts to divide Americans,"" he said. ""I inherited the police practice of stop-and-frisk, and as part of our effort to stop gun violence it was overused. By the time I left office, I cut it back by 95%, but I should've done it faster and sooner. I regret that and I have apologized -- and I have taken responsibility for taking too long to understand the impact it had on Black and Latino communities."" He added: ""But this issue and my comments about it do not reflect my commitment to criminal justice reform and racial equity."" The Aspen Times reported at the time on Bloomberg's comments, which match up with the audio that surfaced Monday. The Aspen Times also reported that Bloomberg and his team ""asked the Aspen Institute not to distribute footage of his recent appearance."" ""That is where the real crime is,"" Bloomberg is heard saying in the recording. ""You've got to get the guns out of the hands of the people that are getting killed. You want to spend the money on a lot of cops in the streets, puts the cops where the crime is, which means in minority neighborhoods."" Bloomberg then addresses the pushback to stop-and-frisk laws. ""So, one of the unintended consequences is people say, 'Oh my God, you are arresting kids for marijuana that are all minorities.' Yes, that is true. Why? Because we put all the cops in the minority neighborhoods. Yes, that is true. Why did we do it? Because that's where all the crime is,"" Bloomberg says. ""And the way you get the guns out of the kid's hands is to throw them up against the walls and frisk them."" Bloomberg goes on to argue in the recording that the policing technique leads people eager to not get caught to stop carrying a gun altogether. The recording highlights one of the former New York mayor and presidential candidate's biggest issues in seeking the presidency: He oversaw the implementation of stop and frisk as mayor, a policing tactic that allowed officers to detain a person on any type of vague suspicion, search that individual without a warrant and arrest the person if any kind of illegal substance or weapon was found. Dixon, the writer who initially posted the audio on Twitter Monday night, said earlier this year that he believes Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is the best option in the Democratic presidential field. While promoting the clip, and several other critical articles and videos of Bloomberg, Dixon has repeatedly tweeted ""#BloombergIsaRacist."" He also did a podcast episode attacking what he called Bloomberg's ""racist, classist past."" When contacted by CNN, Dixon said the audio was ""hiding in plain sight,"" and added that if people ""hear the truth,"" Bloomberg would have to drop out. He said he made no apologies for his support for Sanders. The tactic drew widespread condemnation from minority communities in New York as discriminatory and ultimately ineffective.  Bloomberg, days before he declared his late-entry 2020 presidential bid, apologized for implementing stop and frisk, telling an audience at a predominately black church in Brooklyn in 2019 that while he ""can't change history, however, today I want you to know that I realize back then I was wrong and I'm sorry."" Bloomberg, until recently, vociferously defended his use of stop and frisk as mayor, arguing that the policy tactic brought crime down across the city and largely dismissed claims that the policy was discriminatory. Last year, before he announced his bid, Bloomberg defended the policy by arguing it targeted ""kids who walked around looking like they might have a gun"" and that it works because ""the result of that was, over the years, the murder rate in New York City went from 650 a year to 300 a year when I left."" And even in 2012, when criticism of the policy was at its highest, Bloomberg visited Brooklyn's First Baptist Church of Brownsville and told worshippers that the policy ""should be mended, not ended."" Those series of defenses have led a number of high-profile Democrats -- including current Mayor Bill De Blasio -- to question whether the former New York mayor reversed his position for political expediency. ""This is a death bed conversion,"" de Blasio told CNN in November. ""He had almost six full years to say it was wrong ... we have had plenty of inflection points where he could have said, 'You know what, I was wrong,' ... He has never cared to do that. And I think that says something about the veracity of this."" Stop-and-frisk searches peaked under Bloomberg at 203,500 stops during the first three months of 2012.The practice was cut back amid protests and lawsuits. Criminal justice is expected to be a flashpoint in the 2020 campaign, with Trump already looking to make inroads with minority communities by signing the First Step Act during his first term, a rare major bipartisan achievement during his presidency.  Trump seized on the comments Tuesday, tweeting that Bloomberg was a ""total racist."" The tweet was later deleted. Trump, though, supported stop and frisk as a New York City resident, and even argued during the 2016 election that he would take the policy nationwide. ""I would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive,"" Trump said in 2016. ""In New York City it was so incredible, the way it worked."" According to the New York Civil Liberties Union, more than 5 million stop-and-frisk stops were made during Bloomberg's 12 years in office, with nearly 686,000 stops in 2011 being the high point during his tenure. Of those 5 million stops, 4.4 million did not result in an arrest or summons. Blacks and Latinos accounted for more than 50% of the stops in 70 out of 76 New York precincts; in 32 of those precincts, they accounted for more than 90% of the stops.  This story has been updated to reflect that CNN has reviewed the full audio of Bloomberg's 2015 comments.  CNN's Andrew Kaczynski contributed to this report.",3.5
2584200,24 Tense Hours in Abraham Lincoln’s Life,"5 Things About Your Book Less than two weeks after delivering his second inaugural address, Abraham Lincoln wrote that he expected the speech to “wear as well as — perhaps better than — any thing I have produced.” But, he added, “I believe it is not immediately popular.” He was right on both counts. The speech, barely more than 700 words, is now considered one of the most important in American history. But on the day it was delivered, March 4, 1865, with the Union on the brink of victory in the Civil War, Lincoln had trouble placating his own party, much less his political opponents. And he opted to write words that addressed slavery in grand, religious terms, rather than itemizing the practical ways in which the country would have to begin moving forward. In “Every Drop of Blood,” Edward Achorn addresses sweeping issues about the war and the precarious state of the nation by narrowing his lens to the 24 hours around the inauguration and the many notable characters around the president that day. Below, Achorn discusses the hostility toward the president, the diaries of Southern women, how Stanley Kubrick is like Lincoln and more. When did you first get the idea to write this book? That’s a hard one because I suppose it was decades ago, when I first came across this speech. It has all this resonant language that sounds like something out of Shakespeare or the King James Bible. Here you have this president who’s been re-elected and virtually won a war that was a struggle for the country’s survival, and instead of celebrating he speculates on the war’s immense suffering. He says it may be God’s judgment for the sin of slavery. It’s not an ordinary speech. I’ve always thought I would want to write about it. About five years ago, I decided to do it. A friend of mine said, “You should write about Booth and Lincoln on that day.” John Wilkes Booth, who murdered Lincoln six weeks later, was there watching the speech. But then I began to look at all the people who intersected with Lincoln that day. Walt Whitman was covering it. Clara Barton was trying to win Lincoln’s help for a project she was working on, to find out what happened to missing soldiers. You had Vice President Andrew Johnson, who was drunk at the ceremonies. Frederick Douglass, who was the most interesting to me. What’s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it? I’ve read all these books about how Lincoln was hated, but I was still surprised by how disdained and disliked he was by so many of his contemporaries. Liberal Republicans thought he was too calculating, too quick to weigh public opinion. Democrats thought he was a tyrant, a rube, and was destroying the Constitution. I think a lot of this was airbrushed out of history after he was assassinated, when he became a martyr. But when you go back to that day and look at what people were saying, you get a stunning sense of what Lincoln was up against. There’s a lot of hostility from all sides. I’m not sure how he withstood it. I guess he was defeated so many times in his life, had been down so many times, that he was able to take almost anything. And Lincoln is always surprising to me for his extremely peculiar qualities. He’s got this immense intelligence, and he’s always full of this loneliness and sadness. He goes up to the inauguration alone. He’s a strange guy. He has an ability to step outside himself and to view issues dispassionately. All of those qualities are seen in the book. In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write? It might sound weird, but the more I researched it — it was more illuminating than I expected. As I started doing the research, I learned that these characters had all interacted with each other, and these moments reflected their personalities and their views of the war. I was amazed at what a quilt this became. The other thing I discovered that I didn’t expect was when I looked at diaries of white women in the South on this day, and their intense bitterness really comes through. This was while Sherman was brutalizing South Carolina. It was the first state that seceded, and he wanted them to especially feel the “hard hand of war,” as he put it. These women did not want all their suffering and loss to go for nothing, and they were urging men to fight on. Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work? I’ve always been fascinated with Stanley Kubrick, who had this very dark view of humanity, and I think he had something of Lincoln’s sense of the absurdity of life; the absurdity of every human endeavor, and how they’re prone to be self-defeating in some ways. I also love the way Kubrick uses light and framing and details to tell a story. When I tell a story, I try to look at all those details. I love to quote from newspaper accounts of the time, because it’s funny and poignant and wrongheaded. Part of this book is an exploration of the reviews of Lincoln’s speech. Half the country viewed it as: “What’s he talking about God for? That’s not the place of a president.” It’s always good to put the reader back, right in the context in which something took place. Persuade someone to read “Every Drop of Blood” in 50 words or less. If you love and admire Lincoln, you’ll meet him up close and personal, right on the muddy streets of Washington, surrounded by his endless troubles. Yet he’s able to encourage the nation with one of the masterpieces of literature, and one of the definitive explanations of the American experience. This interview has been condensed and edited.",4.5
2584869,Could Nevada Caucus First in 2024? Harry Reid Wants It,"The retired senator, still deeply involved in Nevada politics, is convinced that Saturday’s caucuses will run smoothly and strengthen his state’s case for leapfrogging Iowa in the next election. LAS VEGAS — As the Democratic presidential candidates plead with Nevadans for their support in 2020, Harry Reid is already looking to 2024. Mr. Reid, the former Democratic leader in the Senate, said in an interview that he hoped that his home state would move to the very front of the primary calendar in the next election. The decades-long tradition of deferring to Iowa and New Hampshire should be over, Mr. Reid said. “We’ve done it for years — to have the other 48 states playing second fiddle to two states that aren’t representative of the country,” he said, arguing that it was unfair for those overwhelmingly white states to vote first. Needless to say, the statement reflects Nevada’s political interests, as well as Mr. Reid’s longstanding ambition to elevate his state in the presidential nominating process. But even as he allowed that he had a certain bias, Mr. Reid insisted it was not merely Silver State pride behind his preference for Nevada going first in 2024. “Of course I think that, but it’s not just me,” Mr. Reid said, citing what he called a general view that Nevada is “more representative of what’s going on in the country.” “We have a state that is extremely diverse — about half the state is white, the rest is minorities,” he noted. “We have a state that is environmentally sensitive. It is a state that’s heavily unionized.” Mr. Reid, 80, is staking his hopes in part on Saturday’s caucuses here, and a number of his current and former advisers have been deeply involved in preparing the state to avoid an Iowa-style meltdown. Nevada has held several days of early voting, with all signs so far pointing to strong turnout. Should the caucuses go off well this weekend — and thus strengthen Nevada’s claim to a place of privilege in the presidential nominating process — it would represent a personal triumph for Mr. Reid, who set out more than a decade ago to give his state a powerful hand in selecting presidential candidates. A longtime critic of Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr. Reid engineered an early role for his state starting in the 2008 election cycle and the significance of Nevada has grown on the Democratic side with each successive campaign. The prospect of Iowa or New Hampshire being displaced in 2024 now appears more plausible than ever, as a result of the fiasco in Iowa this month and Democratic leaders’ growing discomfort with the homogeneous character of those states. But the stakes are high this weekend for Nevada Democrats, who must pull off a complex caucus process of their own if they are going to have a chance of moving up next time. Officials with the state and national parties have taken additional steps since Iowa to ensure a smooth vote, but anxiety continues to run high among Democratic leaders and the various presidential campaigns. Mr. Reid expressed confidence that Nevada Democrats were prepared to conduct a far more successful caucus than the one that unfolded in Iowa, and boasted that his state had “the strongest party organization in the country.” Though he nominally retired from professional politics in 2016, Mr. Reid still looms large as an elder statesman of Nevada politics and remains deeply involved with the party: He said that he was receiving regular updates on preparations from the caucuses and that he had been speaking frequently with Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. But while Mr. Reid praised Mr. Perez as “a very easy man to deal with,” he said he had not recently asked the party chairman for any special assistance in ensuring the success of the vote this weekend. “I think we’ve got that under control,” Mr. Reid said, adding of Mr. Perez, “We keep him advised as to what’s going on, but I don’t think there’s much they can do to help us, except help us financially.” Still, Mr. Reid acknowledged that the voter turnout so far had been higher than expected, leading to long lines at some early voting sites. One of Mr. Reid’s sons had waited in line for an hour and a half to vote early this week, he said, with Mr. Reid’s 18-year-old grandson in tow. “I wish we hadn’t had lines that long, but we really have been stunned by the turnouts we’ve had so far,” Mr. Reid said, adding, “I think that we are having a very good voter experience. The turnout has been something, quite frankly, I didn’t expect.” More than 70,000 Nevadans voted early in the caucuses, according to the Democratic Party, putting the state on track to easily surpass turnout in the 2016 contests. Meeting with a reporter on Tuesday, before the most recent debate, Mr. Reid reviewed the Democratic field in broadly positive terms: He said he believed that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was strong in Nevada, though he noted Mr. Sanders had faced “a little trouble” from the powerful Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which had “indicated they’re not happy with him.” (The labor group has strongly criticized Mr. Sanders for his proposal to replace the private health care system with a “Medicare for all” policy, because it would supersede the desirable health insurance plan negotiated by the union. Mr. Sanders has insisted that any health care plan enacted under his watch would improve workers’ benefits.) Mr. Reid suggested former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had been better positioned in the state before his setbacks in Iowa and New Hampshire. But he said he believed that Mr. Biden still had the potential to finish second, and that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts should not be counted out, either. He added that he had spoken recently with former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whom he described as “a very inquisitive man” who had run an impressive campaign. But Mr. Reid remained scrupulously neutral. When it came to Nevada’s role in choosing presidents, Mr. Reid made no pretense of neutrality. He acknowledged that it still might not be easy to leapfrog Iowa and New Hampshire, but he said he believed Nevada had “a real shot at being first in the nation.” “I’m convinced that Nevada’s going to move up significantly,” he said. Mr. Reid said he planned to visit at least one caucus site on Saturday before monitoring the results from home. Throughout the day, Mr. Reid said, he would “let my presence be known.” Updated Feb. 29, 2020",2.5
2587704,"The Long Search to Fill Soccer’s Biggest, Toughest Job","Why did it take the Premier League more than a year to hire a chief executive? The answer might lie in who was given a say, and in a growing gap between the rich and the even richer. LONDON — There should be no more attractive job in the sports business than being chief executive of the Premier League. England’s top division, after all, is not just a soccer phenomenon, but a cultural one, too. Its chief executive sits at its apex, leading negotiations on the dozens of television contracts that generate billions of dollars in revenue for the league and its clubs every year; arbitrating disputes between teams and owners used to getting their way; and keeping the biggest soccer league in the world ticking. And yet for more than year, and despite an extensive search, that post sat vacant. Two candidates accepted the job, only to fail to take office. The first, a woman hailed as a groundbreaking choice, withdrew for reasons that were never made clear. The other resigned before he had even started work after news reports accused him of inappropriate workplace conduct. And in a previously unreported episode, a third candidate was offered the job, accepted it, and only then was told the league had changed its mind. In the end, the Premier League chose the man who was holding the fort, its managing director, Richard Masters. A consensus pick, Masters, 53, represented a safe choice after an embarrassing recruitment process that reflected poorly on a league that has long prided itself on getting its immensely lucrative business done with minimal fuss. Last week, in his first news media interviews since assuming his new role, Masters projected the air of a modest middle manager, an Everyman happy to coach his children’s soccer teams on the weekend and then return to one of the biggest jobs in global sports on Monday. “We will develop the league in a slightly different direction,” Masters said of his approach to the job held for more than two decades by his predecessor, Richard Scudamore. But not too different, it seems: Masters quickly added that he was already keeping one of Scudamore’s mantras in mind. “It’s all about the football,” Scudamore liked to remind people. “Never forget the football.” Still, the turbulent search and long wait that ended at last with Masters’s hiring in December exposed brittle fault lines in the Premier League’s power structure that may prove difficult to repair. The Premier League has always prided itself on its egalitarianism. It credits its collectivist approach — of balancing the interests of smaller clubs with those of the so-called Big Six of Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal — as the source of almost three decades of worldwide success. But in a series of interviews with executives familiar with the league’s search for a new chief executive, a different picture emerged: of a rift in which the priorities of the Big Six clubs and their colleagues no longer align; of a league struggling to contain the ambitions and financial demands of its most powerful members; and of a competition in which, increasingly, some teams are more equal than others. “There’s challenges that come up every day in terms of protecting the integrity of the league, the value of the league,” Tom Werner, the Liverpool chairman, said. “We’re in a very competitive world.” Werner expressed confidence in Masters last week, and he emerged from the Premier League’s first board meeting under its new leader on Thursday declaring it “business as usual.” But the road to putting Masters in the job was anything but. By May 2019, the Premier League had been without a chief executive for six months. It had missed out on two top candidates. The first, the television executive Susanna Dinnage, had accepted the post in the fall of 2018 and then, unexpectedly, reversed her decision without explanation weeks later. The next candidate was Dave Howe, a top executive at NBC Universal. Howe appeared to fit the bill: He worked for one of the league’s most important broadcast partners in one of its key markets, the United States, and he came from impeccable soccer stock. Not only had he worked for 15 years at the BBC, but his father, Don, was a former England player and respected coach. Howe impressed the nominating committee — then made up of Bruce Buck, the chairman of Chelsea; Burnley’s chief executive, Mike Garlick; and Leicester City’s chief executive, Susan Whelan — and was told the job was his. Presented with details of the financial package he could expect, terms he was said to have found agreeable, there was just one final hoop to jump through: an informal meeting with representatives from Liverpool and Manchester United. Howe met with Liverpool’s Werner and Ed Woodward, Manchester United’s executive vice chairman, and another Premier League executive in May. They discussed his vision for the future of the league, and what he saw as its most pressing challenges. Howe told associates that the meeting went well. Liverpool’s feedback to Buck, the head of the nominating committee, was positive. Soon after, though, the headhunting firm working on the search, Spencer Stuart, was told to inform Howe that the Premier League would be looking elsewhere. No specific explanation for the change of course was offered — Howe, like Dinnage, has made no public comment — and Spencer Stuart was later replaced by another search firm. To those tracking the search, though, it appeared that Liverpool and United had been offered an unofficial veto on the nominating committee’s choice. That is not how either Liverpool or United saw it: Executives at both insisted they did not believe they had unilateral power to decline a candidate. But Liverpool and United had met privately with Dinnage, too, and after Howe was cast aside they also were given a chance to assess the next contender: David Pemsel, the chief executive of the Guardian Media Group. By the time of that meeting, in October, United’s Woodward — as well as the chairman of Crystal Palace, Steve Parish — had been formally added to the nominating committee. Pemsel was offered the job, and accepted, but was forced to relinquish it months later after a British newspaper reported he had acted inappropriately with a female subordinate. A few weeks later, and now more than a year into its search for a chief executive, the Premier League announced that Masters, who had been doing the job on an interim basis, would have the role permanently. The special treatment dispensed to Liverpool and United, though, did not go unnoticed by other teams. Though the Big Six clubs are rivals on the field, they often act in concert off it, sometimes meeting privately to discuss strategy related to board proposals or rules changes. Last week, the split between the big clubs and their rivals was again apparent. A group of Big Six executives held a private discussion before joining the others for the first board meeting under Masters. The meeting yielded an immediate victory: In the first vote under Masters, the Premier League approved a plan to align the closing of the summer transfer window with other top European leagues, an extension sought by the biggest clubs. It was the type of power play teams have warned about for years. “We all recognize the part the biggest clubs play, but they already get big rewards as well,” the Stoke City chairman, Peter Coates, said in 2018, adding: “Fans and viewers want to see a competitive game. Big clubs must never take their eye off that.” The formidable challenge of balancing the needs of the elite with the rest of the league now falls to Masters. He must find a way to convince clubs who believe their brands are stronger than the league’s — particularly in the expanding, emerging markets of Asia — that their self-interest is best met by submitting to the growth of the collective. That approach has worked spectacularly well over the last three decades, turning English soccer’s top league from a forgotten backwater into a market leader, the producer of some of the most valuable live sports content in the world. The Premier League’s current cycle of domestic and overseas broadcast deals is worth $11 billion, revenue that has helped the income of even minor Premier League clubs outstrip some of continental Europe’s oldest and most decorated clubs. And yet Masters has taken the post, almost by default, at a time when the sports media landscape is changing and as the Premier League — still without peer financially — has failed to display anything like the innovation of some of its rivals. La Liga, the Spanish top flight, has worked to close the gap by opening offices around the world to try to build its audience. It has struck a deal to show its games in India through Facebook, and in January announced the start of an in-house network that will beam its matches to British viewers. Germany’s Bundesliga not only produces its match broadcasts and sends a constant stream of promotion into the world, but it has also found ways to sell its archive to companies hoping to find analytical insights. The Premier League continues to lead the way financially. It recently completed a six-year, two-billion-pound (about $2.58 billion) TV rights agreement in four Nordic countries. The figure suggests the appetite for the Premier League is still enormous. Masters said last week that he would continue to expand the league’s operations to serve those audiences. “It has to change a little bit,” he said. “We have to open ourselves up more.” Persuading every club to go along is the challenge. For several years, the Big Six, in particular, have prioritized growing their own commercial revenues abroad and ensuring a greater portion of television income is distributed according to performance — in effect, to them. To date, the rest of the league’s clubs have been happy to ride with what has felt like an ever-rising tide. It is, perhaps, Scudamore’s greatest achievement that he managed to convince the sharks that what they really needed were healthy fish around them. The problem that overshadowed the search process — the one that changed Dinnage’s mind, that cost Howe the job, that Masters now must solve — is what happens when that no longer works.",4.0

2601681,Taliban negotiators to sign deal with US to end Afghan war,"Millions of Afghans are anticipating that America's longest war fought in their country will end on Saturday as U.S. and Taliban negotiators are expected to sign a deal to allow a U.S. troop reduction and a permanent ceasefire. If the U.S.-Taliban agreement gets signed, then Afghanistan, which has been at war since American bombings began in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, will witness the potential end of violence that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. A 31-member Taliban delegation arrived in Qatar on Saturday to oversee the signing of the troop withdrawal deal, said officials of the hardline Islamist group, adding that their political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar will sign the agreement on their behalf. The signing ceremony between the warring sides is set to take place at the Sheraton hotel in Qatar's capital of Doha. Photographs from the venue showed a large banner stating ""Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan"" placed in a conference room adjoining the hotel. Security has been tightened outside the hotel as hotel guests, journalists and government officials thronged the lobby. Security experts said the deal is a foreign policy gamble for U.S. President Donald Trump and would give the Taliban international legitimacy. But for millions of Afghans it opens a possibility to end the ongoing struggle of coping with fear, anxiety and violence. ""Peace is extremely simple and my country deserves it. Today is the day when maybe we will see a positive change,"" said Javed Hassan, 38, a school teacher living on the outskirts of the capital, Kabul. Hassan's children were killed in a bomb blast carried out by the Taliban in 2018. Since then, he has been writing letters to world leaders urging them to end the Afghan war that has dominated the landscape of the land-locked country. Saturday's deal could be the first step towards resetting Afghanistan's future as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is set to witness the signing of the agreement and prepare the ground for a political settlement between the warring sides. America's top diplomat will stand with political leaders of the Taliban, Afghanistan's former rulers who sheltered Osama bin Laden and his militant network until 2001 as he plotted and conducted the 9/11 attacks. A statement from Trump on Friday said Pompeo would be present for the signing of the deal that will pave way for U.S. troop numbers to drop to 8,600 from about 13,000 in the weeks following the deal. Further reductions of western forces will hinge on the Taliban adhering to a ""reduction in violence"" pledge, a condition that will be assessed by the United States. But prospects for war-torn Afghanistan's future are uncertain. The agreement sets the stage for peace talks involving Afghan factions, which are likely to be complicated. Under the deal, the Taliban wants 5,000 fighters to be released from Afghan-run jails, but it's not clear whether the Afghan government will agree. There are also questions about whether Taliban fighters loyal to hardline Islamist splinter groups will be willing to adhere to the reduction in violence agreement. Some senior commanders of the Taliban who arrived in Doha for the signing ceremony said they will ensure that the U.S. and Afghan governments accept all the conditions laid down by the group that controls about 40% of Afghanistan, according to Afghan defense officials. Sources in the Taliban earlier this month said they were prepared to launch a spring offensive and had recruited more than 6,000 fighters and suicide bombers if the agreement collapses.",3.5
2601716,UPDATE 3-Harley-Davidson looks for new leadership to end its sales struggle,"(Recasts, adds more details, analyst quote) Feb 28 (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc on Friday named a board member hailed for turning around the Puma brand's near-bankrupt business as its interim chief as the motorcycle maker gropes for an effective strategy to woo young customers and revive sales. Jochen Zeitz was asked to take over after Chief Executive Officer Matthew Levatich stepped down following the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company's worst sales performance in at least 16 years. Harley-Davidson said Zeitz will serve as interim CEO until an external search firm helps find a new chief executive. Michael Uhlarik, founder of consultancy Motorcycle Global, said Levatich's exit was expected. He said Harley was likely to give Zeitz a long run as he has ""proven turnaround"" skills. Zeitz is well known for transforming the loss-making Puma in the 1990s into one of the world's top three sports brands. ""It is not about the next quarter or earnings per share,"" Uhlarik said. ""They will have to build a long-term, multi-year strategy."" Harley has failed for years to increase sales in the United States, its top market, which accounts for more than half of its motorcycles sold. As its tattooed, baby-boomer consumer base ages, the Milwaukee-based company is finding it challenging to attract new customers. Levatich, who took the company's reins in May 2015, bet on new launches, including of battery-powered bikes, to turn around the company's fortunes in the domestic market. The results, however, remained elusive. Harley's 2019 U.S. bike sales were the lowest in at least 16 years. Falling sales in the past 12 quarters have forced the company to limit production of its bikes to prevent price discount pressure and protect profit. In 2019, Harley's bike shipment volume in the United States was the lowest in at least two decades. Global shipments were the lowest since 2010. With no sales revival in sight, investors were becoming restless. Since Levatich took the helm, Harley's shares have fallen 46%. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index has gained 40%. Falling sales have had made Wall Street speculate whether the company, which symbolized the counterculture movement of the 1960s, would seek refuge in a buyout or turn private to rework its product lines and branding without the pressure from shareholders to shield its profit margins. Last month, Levatich tried to parry that question by expressing confidence in the current strategy. But he also acknowledged that the challenges facing Harley were ""significant"" as its heavy and expensive bikes were competing for ""people's scarce time, people's scarce funding and commitment."" Levatich will assist with the transition through the end of March, the company said. On Friday, Harley's shares closed down 2.2% at $30.47. (Editing by Diane Craft and Tom Brown)",2.5
2602357,Apple to pay up to $500 million to settle lawsuit over slow iPhones,"Apple has agreed to pay up to $500 million to settle litigation accusing it of quietly slowing down older iPhones as it launched new models, to induce owners to buy replacement phones or batteries. The preliminary proposed class-action settlement was disclosed on Friday night and requires approval by U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in San Jose, California. It calls for Apple to pay consumers $25 per iPhone, which may be adjusted up or down depending on how many iPhones are eligible, with a minimum total payout of $310 million. Apple denied wrongdoing and settled the nationwide case to avoid the burdens and costs of litigation, court papers show. The Cupertino, California-based company did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment. Friday's settlement covers U.S. owners of the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7Plus or SE that ran the iOS 10.2.1 or later operating system. It also covers U.S. owners of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus that ran iOS 11.2 or later before Dec. 21, 2017. Consumers contended that their phones' performance suffered after they installed Apple software updates. They said this misled them into believing their phones were near the end of their lifecycles, requiring replacements or new batteries. Apple attributed the problems mainly to temperature changes, high usage and other issues, and said its engineers worked quickly and successfully to address them. Analysts sometimes refer to the slowing of iPhones as ""throttling."" Lawyers for the consumers described the settlement as ""fair, reasonable, and adequate.""

HiSmile is a teeth-whitening brand with a history of paying high-profile influencers like the Kardashians to promote its products on social media. Now the brand is turning to TikTok.The Australian company recently hired TikTok stars from the Hype House and Sway LA — two Los Angeles-based ""collab houses"" — to try to create a wave of attention-grabbing videos on the app. Creators involved in the campaign wore matching sweatshirts and rolled out sponsored videos sequentially over a 24-hour period to maximize its visibility on TikTok's content discovery page, ""For You.""The campaign helped HiSmile add 100,000 followers to its TikTok account in the span of a week. It also drove two million likes, 10,000 comments, and 29 million video views that included the company's hashtag.Business Insider spoke to HiSmile's second-in-command to learn the inside story of how its campaign was conceived and executed.Click here for more BI Prime stories.


The teeth-whitening brand HiSmile knows how to grab attention on social media.The 70-person Australian startup, founded in 2014, previously hired celebrities like Kim Kardashian West and Conor McGregor to promote its teeth whitener on Instagram, sparking both social-media virality and fan criticism in the process.Now it's tapping some of TikTok's biggest stars to boost awareness of its brand on the social app popular with Generation Z.In late February, the company launched a one-week influencer marketing test on TikTok specifically designed to ""make a wave,"" said Justin Gaggino, HiSmile's former head of marketing who now holds the title of ""2IC"" (second-in-command) at the company.HiSmile hired four creators from two of TikTok's most famous ""collab houses,"" Hype House and Sway LA, to post videos of themselves using its Millennium Falcon-shaped teeth whitener.


The campaign, which also involved a fifth TikTok creator (Sarah Magusara, who doesn't live in either house but HiSmile viewed as a trend-setter), helped the company add 100,000 followers to its TikTok account in the span of a week. It drove two million likes, 10,000 comments, and 29 million video views with HiSmile's hashtag.Capitalizing on the ""collab house"" moment — a phenomenon in which some of TikTok's top creators have begun living together and cross-promoting each other's content — was central to HiSmile's vision.The company chose its campaign strategy after identifying which TikTok creators showed up the most on the platform's ""For You"" page — a section of the app where TikTok algorithmically surfaces content that it believes a user will enjoy.""What we saw from our research and from our understanding of the platform is that they were the ones who were really driving the sentiment of the platform and the people who are really being the tastemakers for that platform,"" Gaggino said of the two Los Angeles-based ""collab houses.""'We were looking to make a wave, a butterfly effect on the platform'Consumer brands have been leaning into TikTok this year as the platform has shown to be a vehicle for fast follower growth and high audience engagement.


Milkshake company F'real Foods was already blowing up on TikTok when its marketing team downloaded the app in June 2019. It's since added over 400,000 followers. And the donut and coffee brand Dunkin' earned hundreds of millions of free video impressions from a single user in the first two months of 2020.HiSmile designed its campaign with an eye toward achieving similar virality. The company built its campaign strategy around five influencer clients — Avani Gregg and Daisy Keech of the Hype House, Kio Cyr and Griffin Johnson of Sway LA, and Sarah Magusara, an Australian creator with 11.5 million TikTok followers — who rolled out sponsored videos sequentially over a 24-hour period starting on February 19th.""We were looking to make a wave, a butterfly effect on the platform,"" Gaggino said.To ensure consistency for its campaign, HiSmile sent hoodies to each creator with the words ""No Sensitivity,"" a HiSmile phrase referring to its ""no sensitivity guarantee"" for its teeth-whitening product. The company then asked the Hype House's Gregg to create a custom dance and choose a song that each creator would then repeat in their videos. ""[Gregg] was someone who consistently was appearing on our 'For You' pages,"" Gaggino said. ""She also had an interesting crossover between Sway LA and Hype House where she's [dating] somebody from the Sway LA house, and that kind of crossed over and it's interesting,"" he added.


Gregg encouraged her followers to create their own videos with the HiSmile dance by saying she would ""like"" them. Since HiSmile's campaign launched two weeks ago, about 6,300 videos have been created using the campaign's sound, ""Where This Flower Blooms (feat. Frank Ocean)"" by Tyler, The Creator. (Several of those videos were created by HiSmile for its own TikTok account, which currently has about half a million followers).Gaggino said the company paid each creator a different rate based on follower count, engagement rate, and an internal assessment of their ability to drive trends and positive sentiment for its brand.Negotiating with different agents also played a role in the final price for each post, Gaggino said. Sway LA's creators are managed by TalentX Entertainment, while the Hype House's 19 residents are represented by a variety of agencies like UTA, WME, and A3 Artists Agency (formerly Abrams Artists Agency).TalentX declined to comment for this story, and none of the creators involved in HiSmile's campaign responded to requests for comment.TikTok has been three to four times cheaper than Instagram or Facebook for driving website views for HiSmile The popularity of the HiSmile dance stemmed from a combination of influencer marketing, organic reach, and paid marketing on TikTok.


HiSmile used TikTok's self-serve ad platform to promote its influencers' videos to other users in-feed using a ""Shop Now"" button as a call-to-action. It used age, geographic, and behavioral targeting to promote its five influencers' dances to users aged 16 or older in the US, UK, and Australia who TikTok's ad tool deemed interested in topics like personal care and beauty.""We're testing using those demographic and behavioral pieces of information and trying to segment the audience by that and seeing what works,"" Gaggino said.Gaggino said TikTok is significantly cheaper than Instagram and Facebook for paid ads, which he attributes to the fact that it has fewer advertisers and therefore less competition in its ad auctions.""It's definitely three to four times cheaper for someone from TikTok to land on our website than it would be on Facebook or Instagram advertising,"" Gaggino said. ""It's the quality of that user that is still something up for debate and it's still very new in its life cycle,"" he noted.Other companies have found TikTok's self-serve platform similarly cost effective. The fintech startup, Tally, told Business Insider that TikTok ads were 300% cheaper than Instagram ads for driving app installs.

2611881,Stocks rally after last week's rout on central bank policy hopes,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Equity markets around the world rose on Monday as speculation that central banks will cut interest rates to soften the economic blow of the coronavirus heartened investors and drove U.S. government debt yields to record lows. Factories took a beating in February from the new coronavirus, with activity in China shrinking at a record pace and U.S. manufacturing slowing, raising the prospect of a coordinated policy response by central banks to prevent a global recession. Coronavirus is now spreading much more rapidly outside China than within the country, leading the world into uncharted territory, but the outbreak can still be contained, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. Almost nine times as many cases were reported in the past 24 hours beyond China than inside, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, adding that the risk of coronavirus spreading was now very high at a “global level.” The dollar slipped to a fresh one-month low against a basket of currencies after the U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan and Bank of England all indicated a willingness to take action to confront the economic fallout from the coronavirus. “There’s a growing sense that we’re going to see coordinated action by global central banks to try to offset the slowdown from the coronavirus,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group. While other data on Monday showed U.S. construction spending increased by the most in nearly two years, hitting a record high in January, the upbeat news was overshadowed by the coronavirus epidemic. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to an all-time low of 1.03%. The 10-year German bund DE10YT=RR, the benchmark for euro zone lending, slid to a six-month low of -0.67%. Oil prices jumped more than 4%, reversing an early decline to multi year lows, as hopes of a deeper output cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and central banks’ policy measures countered fears of slower growth. Equity markets rose after suffering their worst plunge last week since the depths of the 2008 financial crisis. MSCI’s broadest index of world shares .MIWD00000PUS rose for the first time in eight sessions, with U.S. stocks rising more than 2%. The MSCI index gained 3.06% and emerging market stocks rose 1.14%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 1,293.96 points, or 5.09%, to 26,703.32. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 136.01 points, or 4.60%, to 3,090.23 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 384.80 points, or 4.49%, to 8,952.17. In Europe, shares edged higher at the close after seesawing for most of the session. The broad STOXX 600 index rose 0.09%. The FTSE 100 index .FTSE closed up 1.13%. The scale of losses last week - almost $6 trillion was wiped off world stocks - led financial markets to price in policy responses from almost every major central bank. Traders now see a 100% chance of a half-percentage-point cut to the current 1.50%-1.75% target rate at the Fed’s March 17-18 meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool, up from no chance of large cuts last week. The disruption to supply chains, factory output and global travel caused by the coronavirus has worsened the outlook for a world economy trying to recover from the U.S.-China trade war. In Paris, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) warned the outbreak could cause the worst global downturn since the financial crisis. In a bleak scenario, growth could drop to just 1.5%. The OECD’s outlook and the likelihood for slower growth has investors and market analysts worried that the worst is yet to come. “Nobody knows how this is going to play out,” said Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research. “There are going to be some nasty headlines in the next few weeks about people in various countries, including the United States, getting coronavirus,” he said. Companies will issue profit warnings and some economic data will look scary, Clissold said, suggesting that, despite the rally on Monday, the market has not found a bottom yet. A Ned Davis examination of previous global health scares since 2002 showed a far lower gauge of investor sentiment, he said. An average reading was about 13, and the coronavirus reading is only 27, he said. The epidemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei, has killed 3,000 people worldwide as authorities race to contain infections in Japan, Iran, Italy, South Korea and the United States. Gold rose. The precious metals market was routed by traders liquidating their positions during a sell-off across global markets on Friday, when gold fell as much as 4.5%. U.S. gold futures GCv1 settled 1.8% higher at $1,594.80. Oil rose after six sessions of losses for both crude benchmarks. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose $2.23 to settle at $51.90 a barrel.

2612446,"On Irish tour, UK's Prince William asks if coronavirus being 'hyped up'","DUBLIN (Reuters) - Britain’s Prince William asked emergency workers if they thought coronavirus was being hyped up by the media during his first official visit to Ireland. Chatting to them at a reception organized by the British ambassador at Dublin’s Guinness brewery on Tuesday evening, William also joked that he and his wife Kate were spreading coronavirus. “I bet everyone’s like: ‘I’ve got coronavirus, I’m dying’, and you’re like ‘no, you’ve just got a cough,’” William said to the emergency workers. “Does it seem quite dramatic about coronavirus at the moment? Is it being a little bit hyped up do you think in the media?” There have been 51 cases of coronavirus so far in Britain, and the government issued a action plan on Tuesday which included a warning that more than a fifth of employees could be off work at the peak of the outbreak. Ireland has two confirmed cases. “By the way, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are spreading coronavirus! Sorry!” William also joked at the event. “We’re keeping an eye on that, so do tell us if we need to stop!” During the reception at the brewery, where William’s grandmother Queen Elizabeth was filmed pouring a pint during a 2011 visit, he quipped that “it is not often that I find myself following the queen to the pub.” He also thanked the crowd for contributing to the “very special relationship between our two countries.” The royal couple are making their first official trip to the Republic of Ireland, to boost ties between the neighboring states that were damaged by fraught, protracted negotiations ahead of Britain’s departure from the European Union. [L8N2AW73U] On Wednesday, the second day of the couple’s tour of Ireland, William and Kate toured a Dublin-based charity that provides mental health support for young people before traveling to a social justice charity in County Kildare.

2618296,Another judge orders review of Russia-probe related document,"A federal judge in Washington has ordered the National Security Agency to turn over to her a memo that details an unusual conversation in which President Donald Trump pleaded with former NSA chief Adm. Mike Rogers to take action to rebut news reports about collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.  U.S. District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said in a ruling Friday that she needs to read the memorandum — written by Rogers’ deputy, Rick Ledgett — in order to decide whether it can be entirely blocked from release in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.  The Trump administration opposed the so-called in camera review by the judge and said it was unnecessary, but Kollar-Kotelly disagreed.  “In light of the ... arguments and legal principles, making a responsible de novo determination of NSA’s exemption claims requires in camera review,” Kollar-Kotelly, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, wrote.  The Justice Department has argued that the entire memo is classified and exempt from disclosure under a form of executive privilege, because the document describes a confidential conversation between the president and a top adviser.  The watchdog group pressing for the memo’s release, the Protect Democracy project, contends that the privilege was waived after special counsel Robert Mueller included a summary of the conversation in his report that was published last year.  Kollar-Kotelly said it is simply too hard for her to resolve those issues without seeing the memo herself. “The Court must consider whether the relevant information in the Ledgett Memorandum has been officially acknowledged, which requires close comparison of the relevant information disclosed in the Mueller Report and the relevant information contained in the Ledgett Memorandum,” she wrote in her eight-page decision.  Kollar-Kotellly’s order was particularly notable because it came just one day after another judge on the same court ordered an in camera review of the Mueller report itself. That judge, Reggie Walton, said in a scathing opinion the review was needed because Attorney General Bill Barr had a pattern of misleading statements about the contents of the report.  Historically, in camera review by judges in Freedom of Information Act cases is unusual, although the preeminent transparency statute explicitly authorizes such assessments. The back-to-back rulings this week suggest that some judges are increasingly unwilling to take at face value representations from the Trump administration about the contents of documents being withheld in FOIA cases.  Kollar-Kotelly ordered NSA to give her access to the Ledgett memo by March 13. She invited the agency to advise her if any special procedures were necessary because of to the sensitive nature of the document.  Spokespeople for the Justice Department and the NSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ruling.  Ben Berwick, counsel at Protect Democracy, said he’s “grateful the Court has now chosen to look at this memo for itself and determine whether the government is inappropriately asserting privileges in order to hide presidential wrongdoing.”",3.5
2621519,A New ‘Emperor’: Russia Girds for 16 More Years of Putin,"‘Do you want an eternal Putin?’ a critic asked after Parliament paved the way for the president to serve well beyond the end of his current term. MOSCOW — One of Russia’s most influential business magnates on Wednesday said the country has become a “quasi-monarchy” — a sign of how President Vladimir V. Putin’s move this week to clear the way to rule until 2036 has changed the landscape of Russian politics. Not that the magnate, Konstantin Malofeev, was complaining. A nationalist financier with Kremlin connections and his own TV channel, Mr. Malofeev has spent decades agitating for a restoration of royal rule. In an interview with The New York Times, he said that after this week’s flurry of events, he had never been closer to his goal. “The quasi-monarchy that we basically now have is a very good thing,” Mr. Malofeev said at his ornate office on Moscow’s Garden Ring. Referring to Mr. Putin, he went on: “If we were now to start calling him emperor, not president, then we wouldn’t have to change much in the Constitution.” In a tightly choreographed bit of political theater this week, the 67-year-old Mr. Putin gave himself the option of ruling for two additional six-year terms when his current tenure expires in 2024. Now comes the harder part for the Kremlin: persuading Russians to accept their new czar. Daria Rtishcheva, a 24-year-old working in the clothing manufacturing business in Moscow, noted that she would be 40 years old in 2036. “And Putin will still be there,” she said in an interview outside a fashionable Moscow department store. “It drives me a bit crazy.” On Wednesday, Russia’s upper house of Parliament approved a constitutional amendment that was introduced the day before in the lower house and then endorsed by Mr. Putin. The amendment would reset the clock on the Constitution’s limit of two presidential terms for Mr. Putin if he runs again in 2024. The Kremlin’s powerful propaganda machine swung into action. The possibility that Mr. Putin could rule for 16 more years, the refrain went, was what Russians needed to keep them safe. While Mr. Putin had been widely expected to look for a way to hold on to power, some Russians were looking ahead to 2024 as a possible moment of political renewal. The message in the pro-Kremlin news media Wednesday was that Mr. Putin had chosen a democratic path to preserving stability in Russia by keeping himself in power. Mr. Putin emphasized that the amendment allowing him to run again would need to be approved by the Constitutional Court and by a nationwide vote. The April 22 plebiscite had already been scheduled as a vote on other, less consequential constitutional amendments that Mr. Putin introduced earlier this year. “The president’s proposal that these amendments be put to a nationwide vote is a very wise and, at the same time, a very bold decision,” Konstantin Dolgov, a senior lawmaker in Russia’s upper house, said on state television. “It is a decision that truly confirms our president’s adherence to the fundamental democratic foundations of the development of our country and our society.” Success in the plebiscite and in the Constitutional Court appears assured, however, given the Kremlin’s control of the judiciary and the electoral system. Putin backers also deployed the familiar argument that Western countries bent on weakening Russia were rooting for Mr. Putin to step down. Had Mr. Putin agreed to leave in 2024, then something like the liberal perestroika reforms of the late 1980s would be in the offing, said Russia’s biggest tabloid, Komsomolskaya Pravda. “Perestroika is canceled,” a Komsomolskaya Pravda columnist wrote. “Life goes on. Thank God.” Mr. Putin may still be vulnerable, however, because of a sputtering economy and long-simmering public anger over economic inequality and official corruption. Opposition activists, taking advantage of the proliferation of high-speed internet access to get around the Kremlin’s control of the television airwaves, have pushed the message that Mr. Putin has allowed his wealthy friends to plunder Russia’s riches. “Do you want an eternal Putin?” Sergei Udaltsov, a far-left Kremlin critic, said in a YouTube address Wednesday. “Do you want to die under Putin and his whole Kremlin band?” Mr. Udaltsov said he was prepared to urge people to cast “no” ballots in the April plebiscite rather than boycotting it, since this week’s developments had turned the previously scheduled vote into a referendum on Mr. Putin’s continued leadership. But Vladimir Milov, an adviser to the opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, said he did not expect the Navalny team to mount a vigorous campaign one way or the other ahead of the vote. The rules under which the vote will be conducted will make it difficult to monitor, and easily falsified, Mr. Milov said. And since Mr. Putin’s newfound ability to run again four years from now does not mean any near-term change, Mr. Milov does not see the constitutional amendments catalyzing major rallies. “All that’s happening now will very much contribute to discrediting the leadership’s image and the decline of its overall legitimacy,” Mr. Milov said. “But the potential for these events to mobilize protests is low.” Nikita Nevedimov, a 31-year-old Muscovite who works in marketing, said that he disapproved of the decision to allow Mr. Putin to run again and that he was generally unhappy with the political situation in the country. But he said he had no plans to vote in the plebiscite or to join any protests. “There’s probably not that much panic, because many people understand that the president doesn’t have a super-big influence on your private, personal life,” Mr. Nevedimov said. “On the whole, everything was moving toward this. There wasn’t much surprise.” But for Mr. Malofeev, the magnate, this has been a big week. He is one of the most prominent conservatives in Russia’s Kremlin-allied elite, and helps drum up support for Mr. Putin on the Russian right. He is under United States and European Union sanctions amid accusations that he financed pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. (Mr. Malofeev denies those allegations.) “This isn’t the end,” Mr. Malofeev said. “The introduction of a constitutional monarchy in the foreseeable future — for instance, after Putin’s rule in 2036 — has become realistic.” Sophia Kishkovsky, Ivan Nechepurenko and Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting from Moscow.",4.0
2626495,Factbox: Scenarios for an Olympics under the shadow of coronavirus,"TOKYO (Reuters) - With just over four months left to the July 24 opening of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, organizers say events will go ahead as planned. But the situation is fluid and filled with unknowns, experts say. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has gambled his legacy as the longest-serving Japanese leader on a successful Games, with Japan investing at least $12 billion in the hopes of a massive boost to the economy. The Games have a record $3 billion in sponsorship, which doesn’t include separate deals between the International Olympic Committee and individual companies, likely worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Media giant NBCUniversal has sold $1 billion in sponsorship and is on track to surpass $1.2 billion. IOC President Thomas Bach has said he is confident the Games will start on time. Tokyo 2020 head Yoshiro Mori - while insisting there would be no changes - said last week that organizers had to address the situation in a flexible manner. Olympic Minister Seiko Hashimoto sparked concerns about a delay when she said Tokyo’s contract with the IOC could “be interpreted as allowing a postponement” until the end of the year - remarks she privately said had been taken out of context. The participation of children from Japan in the torch handover ceremony in Greece was scratched just weeks before it was to begin. Organizers will decide on torch relay celebrations in Japan a week before the torch arrives in each location. Test and qualifying match plans have also shifted. “It is a puzzle you have to bring together,” a source within the Olympic movement told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. “Teams, athletes, qualifications and new countries with the virus every day. Plans sometimes need to be changed again and then again.” Though a candidate to be mayor of London said the 2012 Summer Games host could take over if needed, experts dismissed the possibility because of impossible logistics and no guarantee on the virus. “If you’re cancelling in Tokyo because the epidemic is still a major threat, it’s not going to be any less of a threat in London or Los Angeles,” said Neal Pilson, the former head of CBS Sports who was involved in broadcast rights negotiations for three Olympics. Later in 2020 is also impossible because of packed U.S. and European sports schedules, which precluded holding the Tokyo Games in more seasonal October. Pushing the Games back by a year, to the same time period in 2021, presents huge logistical challenges but does fall into broadcasters’ open schedules, Pilson said. It also allows athletes who have a short window for career success a chance to compete sooner rather than waiting four years. Cancellation is the most drastic step but would minimize logistical issues. The Summer Games have been canceled three times before, all for war - including the 1940 Games, set for Tokyo.

The temporary ban applies to people arriving “from Italy, certain provinces in China, South Korea, Iran and Switzerland”, it said. The government did not say when the ban would be lifted. So far, four people in Serbia, including a Chinese national, have tested positive for the coronavirus.

2630664,Motor racing: Sydney skywriting says 'STOP F1' amid coronavirus fears,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The words “STOP F1” were written in the skies above Sydney on Wednesday amid growing calls for Formula One’s season-opening Australian Grand Prix to be scrapped or barred to spectators due to concerns about the coronavirus. Photographs of the skywriting were widely shared online but it was unclear who was responsible for them. Formula One organizers have already postponed the Chinese Grand Prix which was scheduled in April, while Bahrain authorities on Sunday said fans would be barred from the second round of the season on March 22. Australian Grand Prix authorities on Monday were adamant that Albert Park would welcome thousands of motor sport fans from Thursday when practice sessions and qualifying commence for lower-profile touring car series. Australian health authorities are battling to contain community spread of the coronavirus, with infections mounting day by day and several schools forced to close in Melbourne and Sydney. Australia had recorded 112 cases of the coronavirus as of 11 a.m. local time (0000 GMT) on Wednesday, up from 100 the previous day, the health department said. Three people have died from the disease in the country. The new coronavirus has infected more than 116,000 people and killed more than 4,000 around the world since it surfaced in China late last year. More than 300,000 fans attended race week at Albert Park last year, according to organizers’ estimates. With a prominent art festival in Australia’s southern Tasmania state and other local events canceled in recent days, Australian media pundits have queried the safety of thousands of fans flocking to Albert Park. “In the real world, the Indian Wells tennis tournament in the US has been canceled, the Socceroos World Cup qualifiers have been postponed, major club matches in Italy are being played behind closed doors, and the World Cup skiing finals in Cortina d’Ampezzo have been scratched altogether,” Greg Baum wrote in Melbourne daily The Age on Tuesday. “In the Melbourne Grand Prix world, it’s see you in the champagne tent.” Editing by Peter Rutherford",3.0

2639173,Malaria pill chloroquine tested as coronavirus treatment,"As the coronavirus pandemic rages on, some drugs are showing promise in treating patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.There are no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19, but researchers are testing a slew of existing drugs to see if they could work.One of those drugs is called chloroquine, a widely used anti-malaria pill that was first approved in the US in 1949.Countries including China, South Korea, and Belgium have added it to COVID-19 treatment guidelines as anecdotal reports have suggested that it might work.There is no peer-reviewed clinical data showing that chloroquine works against COVID-19. But that hasn't stopped doctors from using it or US prescriptions from spiking. Even Elon Musk tweeted that it could be a treatment.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.


In the scramble to find drugs to treat COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, one drug has been flying relatively under the radar despite promising early results.The drug is chloroquine, a widely prescribed anti-malaria pill that was first approved in the US in 1949. Early laboratory research and anecdotal reports about using it for people with COVID-19 have shown encouraging signs that it may work to fight the virus.As dozens of drug companies rush into research projects to develop antibodies and other next-generation therapeutics, chloroquine stands out as a potentially simple, cheap, and scalable treatment, though we haven't yet seen data from any randomized clinical trials, the gold standard of medical research.""If clinical data confirm the biological results, the novel coronavirus-associated disease will have become one of the simplest and cheapest to treat and prevent among infectious respiratory diseases,"" a group of French researchers wrote in a paper published on February 15 in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents.One of the three authors of that article was Didier Raoult, a prominent infectious-disease expert who's running a clinical trial in France to test a version of the drug called hydroxychloroquine on a few dozen patients with COVID-19. It's one of many clinical studies going on around the world testing chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.


Early reports of Raoult's trial were positive, with Raoult saying chloroquine appeared to shorten the time that people with COVID-19 are infectious.Never miss out on healthcare news. Subscribe to Dispensed, Business Insider's weekly newsletter on pharma, biotech, and healthcare.When combined with the antibiotic azithromycin, it also reduced the viral load in these patients, he added. Azithromycin helps fight lung infections that can come with COVID-19 and may play a role in fighting the virus, Medscape reported.The French government plans to expand chloroquine testing on a larger scale.Chloroquine has been underappreciatedSteven Seedhouse, a biotech analyst at Raymond James, said chloroquine was just as promising as any treatment option for COVID-19. That includes remdesivir, an antiviral drug being developed by the giant biotech company Gilead Sciences that World Health Organization officials have called ""the most promising candidate"" for COVID-19 treatment.


He recently analyzed the early evidence for three top drugs being tested for COVID-19 — remdesivir, chloroquine, and Kaletra, an HIV drug sold by AbbVie — and concluded that chloroquine was the most promising candidate.""If we had to pick one of the three at this point that actually seems most likely to have the biggest impact on treating COVID-19 in the coming months/years, it would be chloroquine,"" he said.Early reports about chloroquine's effectiveness have also caught the attention of Elon Musk. The Tesla CEO tweeted on Monday that it might be worth considering chloroquine for COVID-19, saying the drug saved his life when he faced a serious case of malaria.—Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 16, 2020Repurposed antiviral drugs aren't likely to be cure-alls, but they are the only near-term treatment options. It will take months, if not years, to determine whether a new drug or vaccine is safe and effective.Vaccines in particular are seen as the gold standard for infectious diseases because they protect people from infections in the first place.


But if drugs like chloroquine and remdesivir work, they could bring major relief to healthcare systems around the world that are feeling the weight of a pandemic.In the US, there are widespread concerns about the likelihood that hospitals will run out of beds and ventilators as the virus spreads, forcing doctors into difficult rationing decisions. That's already happening in Italy.Remdesivir, given as a 10-day intravenous infusion, could shorten hospital stays and lower ventilator use if it can help patients with serious COVID-19 cases recover faster.Chloroquine is being tested to treat COVID-19 and prevent people from catching itAs a simple pill, chloroquine could prevent some COVID-19 patients from worsening to the point of needing hospitalization.Researchers also plan to test chloroquine to see whether it can help prevent healthcare workers from getting the virus in the first place.


The drug can have serious side effects, such as damage to the eyes. It can also cause headaches, dizziness, and stomach problems ranging from discomfort to vomiting and diarrhea.For both remdesivir and chloroquine, there is no peer-reviewed clinical data about whether they work to halt COVID-19. Seedhouse said that even in the face of a pandemic, it is essential to stick to evidence-based approaches.""All we have is some preclinical rationale and some mechanistic rationale, but no hard randomized clinical data yet,"" Seedhouse said. ""I think it's appropriate to be cautious on chloroquine and anything else.""US prescriptions are spiking as the UK guards its supplyWhile peer-reviewed results are the standard in medicine, the lack of that data hasn't prevented the world from acting.China has found that chloroquine is effective against COVID-19, the state-owned Xinhua news agency reported on February 17. Countries including China, South Korea, and Belgium have added chloroquine to their treatment guidelines.


US physicians don't appear to be waiting for data either. Prescriptions for chloroquine have surged, according to recent tracking data from IQVIA cited by Raymond James. For the weeks of February 21, February 28, and March 6, weekly prescriptions grew from 531 to 957 to 1,290.Doctors in the US have broad authority to prescribe approved medications for so-called off-label uses, or conditions that the drug isn't approved to treat.In the past month, the UK has added both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to a list of drugs that drug wholesalers cannot export because UK patients need them and exporting them may lead to a shortage in the UK.Early reports of success 'should be taken seriously'Andrea Savarino is an Italian scientist who has worked at the Italian National Institute of Health, the country's top medical research body, since 2006. He has been studying chloroquine and its potential uses for even longer than that, starting as a virologist in 1994.During the 2003 outbreak of SARS — also a coronavirus — Savarino showed in laboratory research that chloroquine may be a useful weapon against it. But by the time his research was published in The Lancet in November 2003, the outbreak had dissipated and there were no human cases available to test.


""There has been a number of press releases, unfortunately not yet papers, but even the local experiments are things that should be taken seriously,"" Savarino told Business Insider. ""Chloroquine plus the HIV inhibitors has produced interesting results, at least curative results, both in China and Australia.""In Australia, researchers at the University of Queensland have said a combination of chloroquine and Kaletra led to the recovery of some of the first COVID-19 patients in Australia.""It's a potentially effective treatment,"" David Paterson, the director of the university's Centre for Clinical Research, told the Australian news site News.com.au.Savarino said he had heard anecdotal accounts from other countries as well, including Japan, India, and Thailand.""Given these promising results, I am of course optimistic, but I cannot give percentages of success as of now,"" Savarino said. He emphasized the need to collect more data before reaching conclusions.


Savarino said he was developing an online platform to collect hydroxychloroquine data on COVID-19 patients across Italy and eventually other countries. He said he hoped to get the site going in the next few days and would make the data widely available as soon as possible.Ultimately, Savarino thinks a combination of two or three drugs will be found to be the most effective treatment for COVID-19, like how therapies using multiple drugs have become the standard for treating HIV, he said.Read more:The US is sprinting to develop a coronavirus vaccine or treatment.

Slack added 7,000 new paid customers between February 1 and March 18 this year, the company said in a new filing on Thursday. That's more in less than two months than in either of its previous two quarters, as it sees a surge in usage due to the coronavirus, which is forcing more people to work from home. Slack's stock popped over 19 percent on Thursday on the announcement. The surge in paid customers is a ~40% increase over each of its previous two quarters: It added approximately 5,000 paid customers in both Q3 and Q4, or around 10,000 paid customers between August 1 and January 31, the filing notes. Workplace collaboration apps like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom have become increasingly important to allow remote workers to keep communicating effectively as the coronavirus forces more people to work from home. When Slack reported quarterly earnings last week it said it had seen a significant spike in new users due to the coronavirus, but that it was too soon to tell whether that new usage would translate to paying customers and increased revenue for the company. At the time, it said it had 110,000 paid customers total. 


Slack's rival Microsoft Teams announced earlier Thursday that it added 12 million daily active users in the last week, bringing its total to 44 million, as it also sees a surge in usage due to coronavirus. Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield has previously criticized Microsoft's accounting of Teams user growth, saying that users of older Microsoft products are being forced to adopt Teams, since it comes bundled with many business versions of the Office 365 productivity suite. In short: While many companies may have access to Teams, he argued, they may not necessarily be using it. Slack customers, by contrast, are highly-engaged with the app, he said. Microsoft pushed back on that criticism by explaining that it counts daily active users as the number of users who take ""an intentional action"" over a 24-hour period, which includes things like sending or replying to a message, joining a meeting, or opening a file in Teams. Passive actions, like auto booting the app, minimizing a window, closing the app, or Skype do not count towards its Teams user count. Got a tip? Contact this reporter via email at pzaveri@businessinsider.com or Signal at 925-364-4258.

Octavio Romero said that “all necessary adjustments” will be made to ensure that Pemex, which contributes a substantial part of the country’s budget revenues, remains financially stable. Romero added that the company’s oil hedging program covering 2020 has already kicked in but added that it “does not solve the financial problem” stemming from the drop in oil prices on the world market. “Pemex will strengthen its austerity measures,” he said, adding that the objective was to save the equivalent of $217 million in contract and $27 million in administrative costs this year. Fitch Ratings rates the company’s bonds speculative grade, or junk, while Moody’s Investors Service rates them one notch above junk. All three ratings agencies have Pemex bonds on a negative outlook.

2653923,Pound tumbles to six-month lows vs dollar on funding concerns,"LONDON (Reuters) - The pound fell to a six-month low against the dollar and weakened against the euro on Wednesday as investors focused on the economic impact of the coronavirus. News that Britain would launch a 330 billion-pound ($399 billion) lifeline of loan guarantees and provide a further 20 billion pounds in tax cuts, grants and other help for businesses facing the risk of collapse was shrugged aside by traders. Growing concern that funding availability will remain under pressure for the foreseeable future led traders to sell the British currency against the greenback. “The main reason for dollar demand is liquidity concerns as in volatile times, companies and investors need dollars to settle transactions and as long as these concerns persist, we expect the pound to remain on the back foot,” strategists at UBS Wealth Management said in a note. Against the greenback, the British currency fell 0.4% to $1.1985, its lowest since September 2019 while against the euro, the pound weakened 0.4% to 91.70 pence.

Travelling to and from the Uusimaa region will be prohibited until April 19 and the government seeks to enforce it by Friday, Prime Minister Sanna Marin said. The health authority had earlier worsened its forecast for the spread of the virus, estimating that between 11,000 and 15,500 people would be hospitalised and that from 3,600 to 5,000 would require intensive care in the following months. The travel restrictions will be enforced by police and conscripts with certain exceptions such as goods deliveries and indispensable work-related commuting, the government said. By Wednesday, authorities had counted three deaths and 880 confirmed cases in Finland, most of them in the capital region. “The risk of the disease spreading significantly is great,” Krista Kiuru, minister of family affairs and social services, said, adding the blockade was essential to ensure Finland’s healthcare capacity could match the peaking demand. Last week, Finland restricted traffic across its borders, banned public meetings of more than 10 people, closed schools for most pupils and urged people to stay at home as much as possible.

2669219,Contactless payments can help cut contagion: EU banking watchdog,"LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - The European Union’s banking watchdog told payment firms on Wednesday to make it easier for customers to make contactless payments, to help reduce the risk of catching coronavirus. Following advice from the World Health Organization, the European Banking Authority (EBA) said payment services firms could help to limit the spread of the virus by making it easier to make payments without physical contact, such as using cash. Contactless payments involve holding a debit or credit card above a payment terminal, or using mobile phone apps such as Google Pay or Apple Pay. The EBA said it was encouraging payment firms to increase, where possible, contactless payment limits to 50 euros ($54) per transaction, as allowed under EU rules. In France, which is under a lockdown due to the coronavirus, Parisian bakeries are already urging customers to use contactless payments. To protect bus drivers, authorities in the Paris region have also introduced an option to pay for tickets via a text message. The EBA said it would allow payment firms to be exempt from so-called strong customer authentication, meaning more than one check on a customer’s identity to avoid fraud, up to the 50-euro ceiling. “EBA encourages consumers and merchants to take necessary sanitary precautions when providing, or making use of, point-of-sales terminals to pay for goods in-store that require a PIN, including by considering all payment methods available, such as contactless or remote payments,” the watchdog said. Payments company Worldline told Reuters it was hearing from some merchants that cash was no longer accepted and that contactless payments were encouraged or required. In the first few days of the lockdown in France, online bank N26 saw a relative increase in the transaction mix towards card payments versus a drop in cash machine withdrawals, Jeremie Rosselli, its general manager for France, told Reuters.

Morrison said businesses involved in beauty therapy, tattoo parlors, physio therapists and other allied health services could no longer operate. Real estate open houses and auctions were also banned, he said. Weddings could go ahead only with five people present, including the celebrant, while funerals could proceed with 10 people at most and outdoor social gatherings should also be limited to 10, Morrison added.

2677627,Are Pregnant Women More At Risk For Coronavirus,"Finally, in the midst of alarming reports about the coronavirus outbreak, we have some positive news. Pregnant people are not more susceptible to severe COVID-19 symptoms than the general population, a report by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists reveals. What's more, there's no evidence that the illness can pass to a baby during pregnancy or childbirth. These findings are based on observations that have come out of China, including a report from the World Health Organization that studied 147 pregnant women. Sixty-four of them had coronavirus, 82 were suspected to be infected, and one person was asymptomatic. Out of the participants, 8% had severe symptoms. The researchers determined that pregnant people were no more likely than anyone else to develop serious symptoms of the virus. This comes as a relief: Due to changes in their immune systems, pregnant people tend to be more susceptible than the general population to acute symptoms of other sicknesses, such as the common cold and the flu. If this was shown to be the case with COVID-19, officials may have put in place additional restrictions for pregnant people in high-risk areas. Even so, in an interview with the Washington Post, Daniel Roshan, director of Rosh Maternal & Fetal Medicine in New York City, personally advised that pregnant women do not fly — and if they must, to do so with the recommended precautions like washing hands, staying hydrated, and taking prenatal vitamins and vitamin C. As of now, current recommendations for pregnant people remain the same, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""As this is a very new virus we are just beginning to learn about it, so the guidance will be kept under regular review as new evidence emerges,"" says Edward Morris, MD, President of RCOG. “As a precaution, pregnant women with suspected or confirmed coronavirus when they go into labor are advised to attend an obstetric unit for birth,"" Gill Walton, Chief Executive of the Royal College of Midwives, notes. Though virus hasn't been detected in breastmilk, experts still aren't sure the disease can't be passed via breastfeeding. The CDC currently advises mothers to work with their healthcare professionals to determine the best course of action. Until we have more information, the best bet for everyone is to follow the CDC guidelines regarding hand washing, cleaning frequently touched surfaces, and distancing yourself from those who may be sick. ""Pregnant women should take the same precautions as the general public, and should be particularly aggressive with hand washing,"" says Sona Malkani Garg, MD, who practices at Elitra Health. ""They should also be careful to avoid contact with sick people.""",3.5
2678751,Stimulus bill: When will you see money and benefits?," (CNN)Congress and President Donald Trump have enacted a historic $2 trillion stimulus bill to address the dramatic economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Included are direct payments to many Americans, an unprecedented expansion in unemployment benefits and $350 billion in small business loans. But while people need help immediately, it will still take time to get everything moving.  Here's what you need to know:  Direct stimulus payments How much do I get? Individuals would be due up to $1,200 and couples would receive up to $2,400 -- plus $500 per child. But the payments would start phasing out for individuals with adjusted gross incomes of more than $75,000. The amount would then be reduced by $5 for every additional $100 of adjusted gross income, and those making more than $99,000 would not receive anything. The income thresholds would be doubled for couples. Income would generally be based on one's 2019 or 2018 tax returns. Those who made too much to qualify in those years, but see their income fall in 2020 would receive a tax credit when they file their return next year, according to the Senate Finance Committee.  And those who make more this year than last would not have to pay back any stimulus money they receive if they end up exceeding the thresholds. The payments would not be subject to tax, and those who owe back taxes would still get a check. When do I receive the money? We don't know how long it would take the IRS to send out all the money, but it would likely take weeks before the first payments start going out. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday that the IRS would begin issuing payments within three weeks of the legislation being signed into law. The bill simply calls for payments to be made ""as rapidly as possible."" But experts say it could take longer. In 2001, it took six weeks for the IRS to start sending out rebate checks under a new tax cut, and in 2008, it took three months after a stimulus package was signed into law.  How do I get my money? The money would likely be deposited directly into individuals' bank accounts -- as long as they've already authorized the IRS to send their tax refund that way over the past two years.  If not, the IRS would send out checks in the mail. For those that haven't filed a 2019 or 2018 tax return, the IRS would rely on information on file at the Social Security Administration, which keeps records on all Americans who have paid payroll taxes. It's still possible that some people may fall through the cracks. On its website, the IRS says no sign-up would be needed to receive the money, but it's possible the agency ends up offering further guidance. Unemployment benefits How much do I get?  Jobless workers are poised to get an extra $600 a week on top of their state benefits for up to four months. It would significantly boost everyone's regular state benefits, which range from about $200 to $550 a week, on average, depending on where you live. Lawmakers also want to add up to 13 weeks of extended benefits, on top of state programs, which vary between up to 12 and 28 weeks. Plus, more newly jobless Americans would receive checks. A new pandemic unemployment assistance program would expand eligibility to those who are unemployed, partially unemployed or unable to work because of the virus and don't qualify for traditional benefits. This would include independent contractors, the self-employed and gig economy workers. The pandemic program benefits would mirror what's available in one's state.  When do I receive the money? The timing would vary based on where you live, but likely several weeks at least. Unemployment benefits are administered by states. They would have to reprogram their systems to account for Congress' measures -- of which there are a few, some more complicated to enact than others. Not helping matters is that many state unemployment agencies use antiquated technology. Adding a $600 boost to everyone's weekly check would be easier to accomplish, which is one reason why lawmakers designed the enhancement this way. During the Great Recession, the federal government temporarily increased benefits by $25 a week so this experience could help many states now, said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation. But Congress also wants to create a new pandemic unemployment assistance program, which would allow many more Americans to qualify for benefits. It's modeled on the existing disaster unemployment assistance program, but only a few states have had to activate it in recent years, mainly because of hurricanes or floods. All states would have to set up the pandemic program. So it would likely take even longer for jobless Americans who fall into this category to start receiving benefits, particularly in states that haven't faced disasters recently. All these federal changes come at a particularly tough time for states, which are being squeezed from both sides, said Rebecca Dixon, executive director of the National Employment Law Project. They are contending with a historic number of first-time filers, who are already overwhelming their online sites and call centers, forcing agencies to divert staff and boost technical capacity. Plus, these agencies are operating at very low funding levels because of historically low unemployment rates. Small business loans  How much is available? The biggest provision for small business owners in the economic aid package is roughly $350 billion in new loans, at least a portion of which will be forgiven so long as the business continues to employ and pay its workers.  Business owners need to apply for the loans at a lender approved by the Small Business Administration. The forgiven amount would be equal to 8 weeks' worth of payroll obligations (e.g., wages and benefits), plus rent or mortgage bills and utilities. And the forgiven debt would not be treated as taxable income to the owner.  How long will it take? Normally SBA loans can take months, which many small businesses facing a cash crunch don't have. To get the money out more quickly, the bill calls on Treasury and the Small Business Administration to expedite the loan process and approve more institutions to make the loans. It also loosens the rules normally governing SBA loans. For instance, borrowers do not need to issue a personal guarantee or provide collateral. But SBA lenders themselves aren't clear yet just how fast they can process the new loans, even though Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has suggested publicly this week they can do so very quickly.  A joint letter from several banking and credit union associations this week urged the SBA to provide them with ""clear and consistent"" guidelines ASAP. One non-bank direct SBA lender, Fountainhead, has been working for the past two weeks to streamline its own processes so that it will be able to process an application and close the new SBA loan in a matter of days, CEO Chris Hurn said. But lenders still need to know what documents and other reporting measures the SBA will require. Currently, Hurn noted, they have to upload a number of files on a borrower onto the SBA's electronic system. With such an uptick in loans being issued, the chance for overload is real. ""There are some fundamental documents that I'm pretty sure the SBA is still going to want,"" Hurn said. ""To me, that's going to be the bottleneck."" ",3.5
2679327,California coronavirus: Doctors 'cautiously hopeful' early shelter at home measures are working," (CNN)Two weeks after San Francisco issued the country's first shelter-in-place order for residents to prevent spread of the novel coronavirus, hospital emergency rooms throughout the region appear to be seeing the early effects. ""The surge we have been anticipating has not yet come,"" Dr. Jahan Fahimi, an emergency physician and medical director at the University of California, San Francisco, told CNN. ""We're all kind of together holding our breaths."" As of Monday morning, the city reported a total of 374 confirmed infections and six deaths from the coronavirus. While the availability of testing is still much lower than officials would like, the modest daily count compared to other major urban centers may be an encouraging sign that the early aggressive action in the country's second most densely populated city is having its intended effect. ""We have already made a difference in saving lives,"" San Francisco Mayor London Breed said during a news conference Monday, though she and other officials repeatedly cautioned that US communities are still in the early stages of the battle against the virus. ""We're watching the data very carefully,"" added Dr. Grant Colfax, the city's public health director, cautioning that the numbers could still explode rapidly. But that sense of hope has not necessarily reached Los Angeles County where hospitals are seeing a steady increase in the number of patients. Close to 2,500 people are confirmed to have been infected with the coronavirus in the county, with 342 new cases reported in the past two days. Dr. Armand Dorian, the chief medical officer at the University of Southern California Verdugo Hills Hospital in Glendale said while they saw a lull in coronavirus cases over the weekend, ""We were like, 'maybe there is something there.' But honestly, I would be very, very cautious because I really think we are at the beginning of the uptick."" Dorian cautioned that the virus ""is a development that is going to be coming in waves or mini waves. The key is just being so staunch, keeping everybody home for the next couple of weeks to make sure we don't miss this opportunity. And this is not disappearing, it's going to be here for the rest of our lives."" Across town at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, doctors expressed more optimism in the early efforts. ""We are cautiously hopeful that there has been a flattening of the steep curve because we have not seen the exponential rise of traffic coming in,"" said Dr. Anish Mahajan, the hospital's chief medical officer, referring to the rate of new transmissions. Harbor-UCLA has seen a steady rise in coronavirus patients in recent days, increasing from 12 patients on Thursday to 35 on Monday. ""And that may be because of the stay at home order,"" Mahajan said. ""But it's far too premature to say because we have done such little testing. At a press conference Monday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom was asked if officials were beginning to see a flattening of the curve of coronavirus patients. ""We're in middle of this. It would be too easy to say what has or has not worked,"" Newsom said. ""The stay home effort has bought us time to prepare."" CNN's Amir Vera contributed to this report. ",4.0

2684134,"Ventilators and Coronavirus: Amid Desperation, Calls Grow for Federal Intervention","President Trump wants the private sector to fill the urgent need for the lifesaving devices. Experts say that strategy may doom the thousands who will need them in the coming weeks. As hospitals prepare for a flood of desperately ill patients unable to breathe on their own, mechanical ventilators have become the single most important piece of equipment that can mean the difference between life and death. Now, with American hospitals facing a grave shortage of the vital devices, the Big Three automakers, small engineering firms, software designers and medical equipment manufacturers are rushing to figure out ways to produce more of them. But President Trump has so far declined to use powers that public health experts say could make a real difference in getting more ventilators to places that need them the most — right now. What is really needed, a number of public health experts and former government officials say, is for Washington to take control of the nation’s existing ventilator supply. Because peak coronavirus infections will hit cities and regions at different times in the coming months, a centralized federal effort could send unused machines to hospitals that need them most. “This is a national crisis,” said Frank Kendall, who served as under secretary of defense for acquisition and logistics in the Obama administration. “In a time of scarcity, you can’t leave it up to companies and governors to manage it themselves.” Mr. Kendall said that only the federal government had the authority to take over the allocation of ventilators, both from manufacturers who are in the business of selling devices to the highest bidder, and state leaders unlikely to voluntarily let go of machines they fear they might need in the future. “As the states become more desperate, someone has to referee the situation,” he said. “The marketplace isn’t set up to do that.” The United States currently has between 160,000 and 200,000 ventilators, but as many as one million patients could need to use one of the machines over the course of the outbreak, according to the Society of Critical Care Medicine. In New York, the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., hospitals are already on the verge of running out, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this week. Mr. Trump’s solution has been to push the private sector to voluntarily address the shortage. In a Twitter post on Sunday, he encouraged the big car companies to jump in to help make ventilators, and General Motors and Ford responded with announcements that they would partner with medical device companies to produce the machines. But military experts say Mr. Trump could also tap the logistical prowess of the Pentagon and the legion of defense contractors primed to quickly solve complex challenges. The federal government could address problems in the global supply chain that are depriving ventilator companies of the components they need to increase production. Other, quicker options are being explored around the country, including stepping up production of the type of resuscitators used by paramedics and repurposing simpler ventilators used by plastic surgeons and elective surgery centers. G.M. said this week that it would partner with the ventilator company Ventec Life Systems to produce up to 200,000 machines. Ford said it would help 3M and GE Healthcare increase production of respiratory machines they already make. And Medtronic, one of the world’s largest medical device makers, is in talks with Tesla and other car companies, including General Motors and Ford. “This is not a business model problem,” said Vafa Jamali, a senior vice president at Medtronic. “This is a society problem.” But the fruits of these partnerships will not arrive in time to save the thousands of patients who will need the machines in the coming weeks. Ventec’s timetable for increasing production fivefold, for example, is three months. Touring a vast convention hall that was to be turned into a makeshift hospital, Mr. Cuomo said on Tuesday that the state needed 30,000 ventilators in the coming weeks — not months — to cope with skyrocketing infections. “I don’t need ventilators in six months,” he said. “And I don’t need ventilators in five months, four months or three months.” After he spoke, Vice President Pence said the federal government would send 4,000 more to New York. Besides the slow timetable, experts on medical devices questioned the wisdom of bringing in an unrelated industry like the automakers to manufacture a sophisticated medical device. “It’s not like making a sedan or S.U.V.,” said Dr. Hugh Cassiere, a pulmonologist who sits on a Food and Drug Administration panel for anesthesia and respiratory devices. “Sounds good as a sound bite, but the practicalities may be very difficult,” added Dr. Cassiere, who is helping oversee care for more than 40 severely ill coronavirus patients on ventilators at North Shore University Hospital on Long Island. Experts in the field say there are other ways to rapidly boost the ventilator supply for overwhelmed hospitals. Most ventilators are sophisticated machines that keep critically ill people alive by delivering oxygen into the lungs through a tube inserted in the windpipe. Full-feature machines can cost as much as $50,000, but doctors say even basic models that cost less than $2,000 can sustain a patient in acute respiratory distress. The most grievously ill may need to remain on the machines for weeks until they can breathe on their own. There are tens of thousands of no-frills resuscitators used by paramedics and the military. Plastic surgeons and outpatient surgery centers also have ventilators in their offices. With elective procedures indefinitely on hold in much of the country, those machines are now sitting idle. “I think it will be faster to throw a couple ventilators on a truck and drive them to a hospital than wait for new ones to arrive,” said Dr. Adam Rubinstein, a plastic surgeon in Miami who has been compiling a list of doctors willing to loan out their ventilators in a pinch. “So far, no one has said no.” In recent days, mechanical engineers and software designers across the country have been crowdsourcing plans for simple ventilators that could be made with 3-D printers and components readily available at hardware stores. Hospitals have been pulling old machines out of storage and requisitioning ventilators that anesthesiologists use during surgery. Larry Kronick, the president of PMT Partners, a Florida company that sells a simple breathing machine already used by the military and ambulance crews, said he had 1,000 of his Oxylator respirators ready to go, but buyers have been scarce. “I can make 1,000 more, but I need money to buy materials,” he said. Eric Honroth, the North America president for Getinge, a Swedish company that makes 10,000 ventilators annually, said he would welcome government intervention to solve supply-chain bottlenecks for components, but that production would be better left to companies with expertise in the field. “These are complex machines that require complicated technology to keep patients alive,” he said. “I would have some trepidation and reticence about someone else trying to manufacture what we do. It’s not like we’re manufacturing masks.” Then there is the issue of who will run the new devices. Dr. Mahshid Abir, an emergency physician at University of Michigan, said most ventilators require specialized training to operate. With so many health care workers falling ill, there is an additional staffing challenge: patients tethered to breathing machines need to be monitored 24 hours a day. The New England Journal of Medicine estimates that there are only enough respiratory therapists to care for 100,000 patients at one time. “You can’t just put someone on it and press start and you’re done with it,” Dr. Abir said. “There’s a lot of adjustments that need to be made, depending on how sick a patient is. Even if we got an indefinite number of ventilators, we don’t have an unlimited number of people to operate them.” In the meantime, G.M. and Ventec have been “working around the clock” on plans to make ventilators at a small electronics plant the car company owns in Kokomo, Ind., a G.M. spokesman said in a statement. Over the weekend, the automaker began reaching out to its network of suppliers to find companies that can produce parts for Ventec’s machines. By Monday morning, G.M. had found sources for more than 90 percent of the required parts, but was still looking for producers who could supply the remaining components, the statement said. The two companies are trying to work out a deal in which G.M. would essentially serve as a contract manufacturer, according to a person familiar with the discussions who was not authorized to discuss them. While the companies are working as quickly as possible, it could take four or more weeks for production to start, the person said But Dr. James DuCanto, an anesthesiologist in Milwaukee, says relying too heavily on car companies to produce ventilators would be irresponsible. Facing a surge of desperately sick patients, many hospitals have been dusting off triage plans for rationing ventilators that require doctors to make excruciating decisions about which patients would get them if there aren’t enough. Dr. DuCanto often uses the portable Oxylator breathing machine for patients who need short-term breathing assistance and he said they could provide a much faster solution. The machines, which cost $2,000, could be pivotal in sustaining scores of coronavirus patients in a crisis, he said. The only thing they need to function is an oxygen tank. “These things absolutely save lives,” he said. The devices are so simple, he said, that machine shops across the country could be enlisted to produce the components. “It would be easy peasy to make them,” he said. “During a national crisis, there’s no need to reinvent the wheel.” Sarah Kliff contributed reporting.

2688615,How to choose a free videoconference app,"Most people are currently relying on videoconferencing to keep in touch with work colleagues, family, and friends — and if they’re facing financial difficulties, free is best. While Zoom seems to be the most popular videoconferencing app currently, there are several applications out there that will allow people to meet online for free. We’ve listed here a few of the best known videoconferencing apps, along with a couple of popular text chat apps that include videoconferencing features. It’s worth noting that while most of these already have free versions, some are offering access to additional features for all those who are currently working from home or who want to check up on friends and relatives online. There are a number of apps we have not included, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and FaceTime, that allow you to do video chats; however, they either require that all participants be members (Facebook, WhatsApp) or that you use a specific type of device (FaceTime). The following list includes more generalized applications that should allow you to participate without having to download the app (unless you’re the host). A good idea is to try one or two out for yourself to see how well they fit in with your style and those of your friends. This list, however, is a good place to start. Zoom has become one of the most well-known videoconferencing apps, largely because of its easy-to-use interface. The company has pushed Zoom mostly for corporate use, but it has also provided a free basic version for individuals. This version allows up to 100 users to meet, but there is a 40-minute limit on meetings of more than two people, which is, for many of us, pretty limiting. As of this writing, Zoom was not offering any special deals for those now working at home, but it does have a page offering help and advice to new users. Skype has been the go-to platform for one-on-one conversations since the beta was released in 2003. Its Meet Now feature (which is accessed by choosing the “Meet Now” button on the left side of the app) allows videoconferencing; according to the website, the maximum number of participants can vary, depending on your platform and device. There is actually a separate page that purports to let you create a free video meeting without having to actually sign up for the service, but when we tried it, both I and another staff members kept getting an error message. So if you’re using Skype to host a meeting, you’re best off downloading the app. Webex is a videoconferencing app that has been around since the ‘90s; it was acquired by Cisco in 2007. While it’s been mainly known as a business application and continues to concentrate on companies, it does have a fairly generous free version that’s worth checking out. For the current emergency, it has widened the features of the freemium version from 50 to 100 participants, gotten rid of the 40-minute limit on meetings, and added call-in abilities. If you’re not a company, you may not have heard of StarLeaf; it’s a platform for large companies — the kind where they don’t quote a price on their website; you have to call a salesperson. But it is now offering its basic video and messaging product free of charge for those trying to keep in touch during the pandemic. Another “you probably haven’t heard of it” videoconference app, Jitsi Meet is an open-source platform that lets you easily meet online by simply navigating to the site and clicking on “Go.” If you’re more technically inclined, you can build your own via Jitsu Videobridge, but most people will be happy with the quick web version, which offers many features found in more well-known apps, such as chat, session recording (to Dropbox), and the ability to “kick out” unruly participants. A lot of us are already using Slack and / or Microsoft Teams, which do have a limited number of video meeting features. If you’re wondering whether you can use a free version of Slack or Teams to do video meetings, here’s some info: Slack is mainly set up for text chat (and is in the process of rolling out a new design), but it does give you the ability to make voice and video calls as well. If you’re on the free version of Slack, you can make a video call to an individual. But if you want to host a meeting between several people, as opposed to a one-on-one conversation, and want to do it for free, you’ll need to look for an alternative. Microsoft Teams was obviously built as a competitor to Slack; because it is part of the Microsoft ecosystem of applications, it’s a good idea if you want to, say, collaborate on various Office documents, and it offers videoconferencing features. Currently, Microsoft is offering educators and those paying for G Suite the chance to use Office 365 E1 free for six months. Individuals who just use Gmail or other free apps are routed to Skype.
